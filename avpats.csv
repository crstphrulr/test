So I think once you meet a criteria where they're comfortable with you being okay and not really needing that arm anymore, then they move you to that once a month type thing.","over, comfortable, okay",FALSE,RA,Yes,1,0.662008107,Female,Patient,NotMentioned,NotMentioned,PROCEDURE,get_treated,0.333333333,0.25,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.25,0,0.75,0.662008107,0.66953963,0.31851095,0.587960243,0.634856105,0.599332154,0.547708869,0.402247995,0.379796356,0.408984303,0.547311604,0.450569391,0.72198993,0.446423382,0.568955362,0.520125508,-0.015474443,0.321905702,0.237266243,0.541532397,0.193582982,0.484235168,Social proof,0.174675465,0.750366092,0.277599961,0.923505247,0.999996066,1.05E-06,0.003215784,0.019589536,0.999999642,get_treated
