Verbatim
"Like just walking. I can't go far distances because I can't breathe. I'm on oxygen, as you can see, because of the COPD, so I have a 50 foot width, that I'm in my home width. When I go out, I have to either carry a tank or whatever size, or wheel a tank with me, depending how much oxygen I'll need, how long I'll be gone, so it's limiting. I can't do far distances. I can't go places with my kids like I used to, even the museum, if I want to go there and be with them for the whole day, I need my wheelchair. Then someone has to push me and that's not fair to other people. And even talking, you'll probably notice I have to stop and catch my breath because I run out of oxygen to keep talking."
"Well symptoms are daily, they're like your chest gets tight and you just can't get the air you need into your lungs to breathe and to carry on. Sleeping is, I have to wear a bag, because I don't read properly. And I don't know the struck of where I was going with that."
"Yes. When you're laying down, it feels like my chest is just being smooshed, like it's tight. I just can't expand it to sleep. So, you know, you're restless all night, I toss and turn. During the day, just walking sometimes to the bathroom and back, I got to catch my breath, I got to take a few minutes to recover from it and it's a sad thing. I can't do much activity and exercise like I use to. And I put on a lot of weight because of the less activity, that's still my fault, but it's part, that is part of the reason, even with rescue inhalers and stuff like that, it doesn't always open my lungs up enough to feel like I can breathe good again."
"I have, just before the pandemic actually. I had been in the hospital because I had an attack and it led to lung failure and I spent a week in the hospital and then I had to go to rehab. Rehab to kind of build me back up again to just doing daily functions."
"Being in the hospitals, it's no fun. It's not a place you want to be. There, they do a lot of tests and poking and prodding and blood draws for the saturation, the oxygen saturation levels in your body. And it's just, there's no rest there. And in the meantime, at the same time, your feeling horrible, because you just can't breathe, you're not getting oxygen. Your chest hurts, but it can also make like your face numb and tingling and your arms and feet, legs numb and tingling from the lack of oxygen and you're just miserable and you can't get comfortable."
"There can be, some of them make you tired and lethargic. Some of them, the steroids make you all like wound up kind of, but they also make you puffy and gain weight. Some of them, you can just get a rash from, and then the inhaled ones, you can get problems with your mouth and your teeth if you don't rinse your mouth out good enough."
"Yeah. I try not to push too hard. I mean, you certainly have to do what you have to do, but when I feel the wheezing and the tightening starting, I stop because I don't want it to go into a full blown attack because I don't want to go back to the emergency room and spend all those hours or days there recovering and getting better."
"Well, COPD is, it's kind of tough because it's not something you can see, it's not obvious to other people what's wrong with you and it's difficult for people to understand unless they have it. You might look totally healthy and it can be anybody that can be affected with it, just because I look like this, I could be 90 pounds in C O P D, it doesn't matter."
"And you can be young, old, there's no age, discrimination either. And it's frustrating because a lot of times I get left behind because I just can't do it. I can't what we went, my family was visiting and we went to Niagara falls. I couldn't go because there's no way I could walk all the walking there is there. So it's kind of a lonely disease as well."
"I have several times, when you get the chest pain and that, and they, you go to the emergency room, they usually give you breathing treatments and they check out everything out at the same time, but they get you back on your feet so you can go back home."
"Yeah. They give you steroids and stuff, which is not good for you, but it does help your breathing and your lungs."
"I do. I take pills, I have inhalers, I have a nebulizer and I do them all daily, sometimes multiple times a day. And I have an injectable medication as well for the COPD."
"I do, sometimes, because even though there's medications and inhalers and pills and everything, there's not always, it doesn't always satisfy what you need. It doesn't always take care of, but-"
"Yes, I do. It's either pills, inhalers, nebulizers, and that's about it. There's not and many other options. And oxygen, of course, but there's no real cure that I've heard of."
I do. I have myasthenia gravis and I've got diabetes. I have a lot of conditions and they all kind of do impact each other. Just stress alone can make it exasperated. So they're all interconnected.
"Anyway, so what I like to do when I'm not working is I have two noisy and cheeky cockatiels and they are little yellow parrots with orange circles on their cheeks and are very messy and are really not good for people with a breathing problem. But hey, I had them before I had the breathing problem. They're very long lived."
"I like clothes, a lot, and have too many. I'm into very interested in politics and I'm a news junkie. I watch the 24 hours BBC news channel. It's always on. And in the past I was heavily involved in amateur theater. Yes, I acted and stage managed and directed and anything else that was necessary and unfortunately, I don't do that anymore. Not just because of COVID. I just can't do it anymore because of COPD and few other difficulties. Anyway, of course, mentioning COVID I've been shielding for a year now in the great city of London. And yet I'm stuck in my home. I'm looking forward to it ending because it's, my world is limited enough already. I don't need this. There's a little bit about what's going on."
"But in the meantime, while waiting for the specialist appointment, I had my first flare up, which was pretty wild. I took a taxi, in this case, to the nearest A&E and waited ages for it. Finally, they saw me and told me that I had COPD. I had never heard of it before and gave me inhalers and long term and short term inhalers."
"So, that was, and again, it was, it was something. Again, it all started very dramatically and the symptoms were fully fledged, right from the start. I didn't have a build up as I understand a lot of other people. And so they've always been at the very severe level. Again, it was understanding about it and coming to grips with it that allowed me to realize how to manage it. And symptoms have been fairly much the same over the years, except for a short period where I was experiencing numerous flareups and quite severe flareups. And I was in and out of A&E at least once every two weeks, being blue-lighted in and sometimes staying overnight."
"And again it was just a really, it was, I used to call them pit stops, but anyway, it was a scary time because I was deteriorating and I was told, I was even, it was even recommended. Well, one thing that was recommended was lung transplant, but that wasn't possible although I qualified for age and deterioration wise, because I just didn't have the support."
"It needed, what needed to happen was, well, what did happen, actually, there was a very astute respiratory nurse at the hospital, and she took me in hand, and between herself, and she made arrangements to get me joining the respiratory team at my local hospital, which I hadn't been for some reason. And we finally worked out a combination of prescriptions and pulmonary rehabilitation, 24 hours seven oxygen, and a antibiotic on a regular basis as well as prednisone on a regular basis and so it leveled things off."
"And in fact, I actually, to a point where I could say for about a year, I didn't have a flare up, which required me to go into the hospital. I had a flare up, but I had learned how to identify it and again, what I would do is I'd use an emergency pack, which consisted of additional steroids and I had more heavy duty antibiotic."
"The longest time I had to stay in the hospital was over, just about two weeks. But, that wasn't because of the COPD. That was because of the, I had a heart failure. It was kind of a very severe one. It seemed like curtains at the time, but actually, they caught it in time. In fact, I went to the same hospital as Prince Phillip went to last month. Bart's in Ottawa, Bart's in London, same crowd, same place, same reason."
"And so, and again, generally, if I do have a flare up, I generally do have to go into to the hospital, but it's better than it was. It's not as often as it was. Like I say, the thing is, the treatment is, I've gained weight because of the steroids in my stomach area. I'm not inclined to exercise, so I've lost, lost my ability. If you don't use it, you lose it."
"But what I've done is, a recent thing is, I've purchased what is called a standing desk. And, that with an exercise bike connected with it. As I use the computer a lot, I'm going to be on my exercise bike, so I've solved an issue that I have. I don't like exercise for the sake of exercise, but if I'm sitting there and having to do it, I don't have a chair. Fortunately, got rid of the chair and forced when I'm not sitting on the couch like I'm doing now to, pardon me, to exercise."
"A big negative has been, along with predating COPD, has been the fact that I've had, I've suffered from anxiety and depression. And I also have a personality disorder. Hey . A schizo-type of personality disorder. And the thing is, it isn't a nice combination with COPD because again, basically with schizo-type of personality disorder, you're, you have difficulty in the social sphere, and you don't have a great ability to read, interpret people's reactions. And especially in challenging times that's hard. That has affected me at work."
"Anyways, it turned out I was, for a long time with work, I was ignored and isolated, and didn't get promotions, didn't get any work to do. And it was only thanks to the union that I was able to really fight that and get, get them to, look past their noses and see that, given a proper circumstance, I was able to still do the work as a coder. Coder can do the work at home. And so anyway, like I said, that's been resolved and then it's going to be nicely resolved with retirement, which is coming soon."
"So, anyway, it was, well you see it was interesting when the specialist first was explaining it to me cause he quipped, you know, usually people don't hear you breathing."
"Anyway, so it turned out it was a virus, but I'm still stuck with a lot of additional medication for heart failure. So, that hasn't reoccurred fortunately."
"I'm pretty sure that they did an EKG. At that time I had no idea what the hell that was. They did a 12 lead EKG, and I can't remember if they came in and did an echo that night or not. I think maybe I had my echo after I was in the hospital that day they put me in. I think that next day, because that's when I'm met Calvin. So I'm pretty sure they probably did an echo that morning and then I met him that afternoon."
"I don't know. I have a note in my med bin with what I take, what times, so that if I'm sick or something, my husband can fill my med boxes up for me. He also knows, ""Okay, she's got to take this."" He's gone to every single doctor's appointment with me since I was diagnosed. So if for some reason I wasn't able to speak or anything like that, he would know what he needed to do with my meds or with which doctor to call, things like that."
"Well, I guess they did, I don't know. I mean, it's kind of blurred because I was pretty much on a lot of pain medicines because of my chest getting into, and my legs. I was in a lot of pain. I couldn't take a bath, I had to take a shower and it's like, I did not like standing up in that shower because of the heart... What's the word? Where they cut into my heart."
"Well, I guess most of you know, it's just sort of creeps up on you. I'm very upset about our society that gives us no real warning of the terrible danger that COPD is. When you lose your capacity to breathe, you basically lose your capacity to do most things and you don't know that, I didn't know that going in. I know it now and I've developed little coping mechanisms to make life a little bit easier, how to more easily walk to the bathroom, for example, or take a shower. Little things mean a lot when you're having trouble breathing."
"Okay, okay. And you know like you talked about the water pills that some people take to help them, and it's something that you don't need, do you know the meds that your cardiologist gave you, when they told you about the medicines, what did they say? What are they for?"

"Cool. And the only other thing is like, as you know, as we all know, all people can respond differently to different medications and some side effects might not be discovered until way, way down the line. So if during our conversation, we're here, anything comes up, side effects related to one of the sponsoring companies products, we'll just report that and get some more details on that. Just to improve and help understanding about safety of their treatments. Is that all? Okay?"
"Maybe if there's anything, I guess it's going to help. So you don't have to rely just on the memory. You've got the chart there to check against, if we need to. But it sounds like, I guess, the asthma, diabetes as well, was diagnosed a while ago, before the heart failure, is that right?"
"Especially at the moment, right? Okay. So Jackie, tell me a bit. I want to go back as much as you're able with your memory, and I know it's a little while ago, but to before you got diagnosed with heart failure. When did you first start to think, ""Okay, something's up. Something's not right?"""
"Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, it sounds like before that day that you described, where you obviously ended up in the ER for 12 hours, how long was that time where you said your legs would swell up and you were out of breath, how long was that going on?"
"Cool. And basically everything we talk about is just for market research purposes, right? So you can withdraw from the interview, you can withhold information if you wish, it's totally up to you. And the only last thing is that, as we know, right, some people respond in different ways to medicine and some side effects might not be discovered until people have used the medicine over a longer period of time. So for that reason, if we hear about... During in this interview, if we mention any side effects related to one of the sponsoring companies, medicines that they produce, we'll have to just report that. That's just to help understand more about how different people react to their medicines. So-"
"...Yeah. So as much as you can remember, Kathy, yeah. Like it's not trying to be a memory test, just tell me what you can remember, but do you remember what the cardiologist said about what had happened and specifically the congestive heart failure as well?"
"Yeah. Hey Kathy, I lost you again. Sorry. Bare with me, I hope you're going to come back in a moment. There you go, there you go. Okay, you're back now. Sorry, I appreciate your patience, it just freezes sometimes and I can't hear what you're saying. But it's okay now. Okay, so the technician can't tell you anything right, about the ultrasound, you have to wait to speak to the doctor, to the cardiologist. So what do they say? What do they say about it?"
"She's got something to say. So Kathy for other people like yourself, right, who may get diagnosed with congestive heart failure, What do you think would be really helpful? What could be done to help the situation and improve the experience for people like you and for others?"

Right. Yeah. You mentioned fibromyalgia. I think there was one more as well you mentioned.
Okay. Okay. Are there any other conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
"Right. Okay. Okay. And then you mentioned the sleep apnea was just shortly after that, I guess."
"Okay. So asthma was before, and then most of the other conditions then seemed to be after. What about the gout? Was that before?"
"So you said you see... So cardiologist, right? If you know it's something with your heart. Pulmonologists for lungs. Internal medicine?"
"So when you would go and see a doctor about the issues, what would you say? How would you talk about your symptoms and what was going on?"
"Were you ever seeing a pulmonologist, at this time, for your asthma?"
"The next day, is that when you found out or you were told that you had heart failure?"
"Right, right. Right. Yeah. And as you started to are pick it up anyway, I know you kindly shared with us the treatments that you are on. If I can just bring that up on the screen."
"I think at the bottom, this is all your meds, right?"
"No, thank you. Thank you. That's what we wanted, to see everything. Just to see which ones of all these meds, what are they all for?"
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So how do you manage all of these treatments? How do you keep a handle on it?
"Right, right. Right. I guess, even during COVID, was that okay, to have someone else there or were they just virtual appointments, I guess?"
Did they tell you or communicate to you your ejection fraction when you were diagnosed?
"So you said you got diagnosed with COPD, when was that? Was that more recently?"
"Okay. Okay, okay. So you mentioned congestive heart failure, COPD, any other conditions that your doctor told you about that you've been diagnosed with?"
"Oh, okay. Okay, well Kathy, do you want to tell me... Start from the beginning, because you said you were in the hospital, right? You had this quadruple bypass, when was this? When did this all happen?"
So what was that? What was that surgery?
"And how's that now? I guess, are your legs okay? Have they recovered?"
"Okay, okay. And Kathy before this happened, right, before what you just told me when you went to the hospital, had you ever had any issues with your heart before that?"
What about in terms of blood pressure? They mentioned your blood pressure was so low.
"Okay. What do you know now about it? When you say congestive heart failure, what is it?"
"Yeah. Of course, of course. Okay, so it sounds like the COPD has a bit more of an impact on your daily life?"
"So thank you so much for doing this. This is really helpful, thank you. You mentioned some of the meds you were on, so I can see those here, right?"
"Okay. Okay. Yeah, with the mask."
"I think that's an inhaler, right?"
"Okay, okay. So which of these did your cardiologist tell you to take for your heart failure?"
"Apart from the prednisone, right, you said you didn't like that one?"
"Right, right, right. Okay, okay. All these meds we can see here, right, as much as you can remember yeah, but since you saw the cardiologist and talked about congestive heart failure, have you always been on these same medication or did anything change?"
"Same tests, yeah. Okay, okay. And just tell me briefly, with the COPD, When did that start?"
"Okay, okay. And how had you been having any problems with the breathing before then?"
"Tell me about that, when they do the baby thing on the heart, the ultrasound, what do they tell you about what-?"
"Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Okay. I got you back, you're back now. Yeah, so they do the ultrasound, just like they do if you have a baby, right, but on your heart. Yeah?"
"The same EECP, you've done it three or four times."
"Ah, to do it. Right. Okay, okay. So when they do the ultrasound of the heart, is this every time you go, every three months, they do that?"
"Yeah, yeah. I see, I see. Okay, did they ever mention when they do the ultrasound thing, did they ever mention the term, like ejection fraction? Did they ever say that?"
"She's laying on the couch. Okay, good. Cool. How do you feel about about the future managing your heart failure, how do you feel about it?"
"Yeah, of course. Of course. Even today, how you feeling today with the COPD?"
You're listening to Medcazt. Updates and opinions for the AstraZeneca medical community.
"In this podcast, Gwen Carlton, respiratory and immunology scientific training lead, interview Stephanie who has COPD about her journey as a patient with COPD."
"Thank you for listening to Medcazt. We'll have new podcasts available soon. If you have ideas for a podcast or any feedback, please get in touch at medcazt@astrazeneca.com. That's M-E-D-C-A-Z-T@astrazeneca.com take care and keep delivering on the science."
"Well,  I didn't know at the time, but she said it helped them to take the oxygen into the shower, not the machine, but the cannula so you could have oxygen while shower, which is good. The occupational therapist gives you this little clipper thing where it helps you reach things, stuff like that and it also helps you reach and get things and get your socks off, stuff like that. Things like that. Putting your socks on and off, you just have a trial and error to find the easiest, most comfortable way to do that because there's no natural way anymore."
"Sure. As she said, I'm Pete. I've had formally diagnosed COPD for about seven years, but probably have had it a good deal longer than that. We're doing our best to try to have a decent quality of life under this difficult situation so I'm glad to share anything I can that can be helpful to others as others have been to me."
"Just a funny story. Yeah. Was impressive and this is, like I said, four or five years ago, I'm sure it's better today. The emergency room was equipped and the people were trained to do the job. That's reassuring. That's on the one hand. What's less reassuring of course of is the fact, as all of you know, is that there's no medicine that really can get you better."
"With COPD I've had shingles, I don't that it's cause and effect, I've had sciatica, I've had carpal tunnel, all of which have been ultimately corrected, but they all strangely, now whether your body's weaker and this happens, I don't know. But it is kind odd, isn't it?"
"My pulmonologist, he's a state of the art guy, he knows what's going on. The problem I have right now, he's just over here today, there aren't any new medicines out there. We're the end of the present line. Would you believe it, the most effective medicine for me is the oldest one, albuterol."
"Yes, I do. The doctor has taken a measured approach that because as he said, ""We can't cure this, but we can make your quality of life as good as possible and using oxygen properly to do that and that has proven to the case. I'm now taking oxygen 24/7, built up to that, at level three. I was fortunate enough to be able to afford to buy a very lightweight, less than three pound oxygen concentrator, which enabled me to move on around. These other things it's like you need a wheelbarrow to move them around."
"Well, it's an interesting question. Prior to COPD, I never took a pill. I was one of the healthiest people you ever saw. I smoked. I did this myself, I know what happened. My point is that I was healthy."
"No, no. Not even close. Not only can I not really walk, but when I put my arms above my head, I get out of breath."
"Whether that's cleaning or cooking or golfing or anything else. COPD when it stops something, it stops."
I find thar it varies by day how strong or weak I am.
Because my voice varies by day so it's very variable manifestation of this disease.
"It might be good for people to take their vaccination. I've had them both. Now that's some, no problems."
"Was the shot  medicine, the stress where they did the shot in my arm."
"Okay, okay. So you said that the high blood pressure, the high cholesterol, did you know that before all of this happened or was this after the -"
 was on the heart attack?
"Right. Okay. Okay, cool. I'll stop sharing that now. But thank you. Thank you so much for filling that out for us and talking us through. You mentioned there was some changes to your treatment. But the treatments that we just looked at for heart failure, did you start on all those treatments straight after?"
"Okay. It all started, my ex and I separated like that night and my daughter and I were walking, I was walking the hallway and she was walking the hallway, my youngest daughter. And it's like, I felt like a bump on my chest and I don't know how to explain it. I just, I laughed at her and I said, oh, I just had a heart attack. I was just joking about it... Lexi. And I said, I don't feel very good... Lexi. I said, I don't feel very good at all."
"Okay. I didn't feel very good at all. So I called my ex to see if he would take me to the hospital, he said, no know he wouldn't be able to take me to the hospital. He didn't want to because he didn't believe I was sick so he didn't take me so I'll have ask my daughter if she would run the bath water for me. So she ran the bath water for me. And after I got out of the bath, I told her, I said, I'm going to end falling asleep on the couch. And I ended up waking up in the middle of the night and I ended up calling him again and he ended up taking me to the ER. Once we were in the ER, they told me, they said my blood pressure was so low, they were surprised I was still talking because they did the test on me, they did chest x-ray and all this other stuff."
"They did put a catheter in me, I guess get me ready for surgery, I'm not sure. But an ambulance came and picked me up and took me two hours away. And when I went to the heart hospital, Arkansas Heart Hospital. And I remember them, tried to do a catheter... Not a catheter, but a stent in me because I remember telling them ouch, that hurts. And that's the last thing I remember, except whenever I woke up."
"Right, two weeks later. And my daughters told me that I passed away twice. All my relatives were there because they called all my relatives and told them to come because they didn't think I was going to make it. So that's pretty much all I know, I haven't talked about it."
"Oh yeah. I see my cardiologist every three months and I do this stress test and they do the... I call it the baby test where they use the ultrasound and check on my arteries and stuff and my heart. But yeah, I see my cardiologist every three months and I see my pulmonologist every three months. Those are my main doctors that I see."
"Oh wait, wait, wait. Yes, now I also have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, I also have that. They didn't say anything after they had the surgery, they just told me I was lucky that I came out of it, and I don't know. It's weird. I mean, it's like, I just never asked, I don't know how come I didn't, but it's like they kept me there I think a day or to more after I came to, and then they let me go home. I remember the nurse was like getting onto me because I wouldn't eat. I tried eating and it's like, it didn't taste right."
"No, I never went and got checked out, which I should have. I should have seen a cardiologist way before this happened, but I was going through a divorce, and then my dad passed away like two weeks before so I think that had something to do with my stress level. That's why I had the heart attack. That's what I ."
"Actually, no. Whenever my kids were young, I took care of them. I took them to the doctor. They came for me, it's like I never went to the doctor or anything because it's like my kids always came first. And I don't know if you talked to some people who let's themselves go, well I was one of them that let myself go. And I really did not think I would have a heart attack it 49, I was 49 whenever I had it. That's young."
"Yeah, I had to see a cardiologist, I think two weeks after I got home. But then home health came to the house and they did my bandages. They cleaned my bandages and stuff and they were making me walk and everything, but I was in so much pain it was hard to walk. Well, they had me walk at the hospital, but they had me walk from like my door to the mailbox and that was a pretty long way, and it was killing me. I was glad whenever they left the home health people."
"From my cardiologist, yeah. I found out. And it's like whenever I found out I had it, the first thing I thought was, I guess you can die from it. Because a lot of people that I've talked to take the water pills and stuff. Well, I have a mild case of it, my case is mild, I don't even take the water pills because I don't swell up like a lot of people do."
"And a lot of people have had surgeries. I mean, to keep going to the hospital and stuff. Well, I haven't really gone that much. I mean there's a couple times I thought I was having another heart attack but besides that, the only time I've ever been back to the hospital since 2011 and everything came out fine. I kept taking my blood test and checking my blood and stuff and everything came out fine."
"Oh yeah, uh-huh . Protozone-"
"Yeah. It's an inhaler. Yeah, I was going to . It's an inhaler. ProAir is also an inhaler in case... And ROP, I'm not sure what that is. I can't tell. One of those is also my depressive medicines, I'm not sure. I think it's behind it. I can't see it."
"I don't take it. Something about, it's supposed to help me breathe better or something, but so much weight gain. And I've started losing weight and I was all happy and everything, well come to find out the reason I was losing weight is because my breathing and my oxygen, something about it, my breathing makes me lose so many calories a night and that's how come I've been losing the weight. And I was all excited and everything and coming to find out that's how come. So I'm not very excited now."
"Well, okay. What they do is they check my blood pressure and then like the first appointment, like I say, I have a stress test. I did this one where they put this medicine in my arm and it made my heart go real fast and it made it go real slow and it stopped... Not stopped it, but I mean, it's the medicine like made it go fast and slow. That was scary, I told him, I was like, ""I would rather run on the treadmill than do that."" Because it was so scary. But anyway, they start testing me every time I go back to them every three months. Like this time, whenever I go back, most likely he'll probably put me on the EECP machine. Electro... You know what those machines are, right?"
"Electro... Where you lay back with the things on your legs and it goes up and down, up and down. Yeah, I've done that a couple times already. And I do it for 35 times, I think in like a month and a half or something like that, two months, something like that. But I'm only allowed 35 times. 35 visits to do it. To do the EECP."
"Okay? And, but normally whenever I go back, say they do the stress test with me running on the treadmill. They also have me stand on this, it's hard to... Like a scale. I stand on it and while she types something in, and that's I think to test me for polavio... I can't think of the word. It's where your legs are messed up, where you have that disease pivaro disease, or... I can't think what's called. I can't pronounce it."
"But anyway, they do that, the distress test, and then I do this in appointments and then he tells me what's wrong. And they do that. They do the stress test, I go back, they tell me, okay, you have such and such blockage or you don't, or you're fine, and then like, I go back again, get another test done. I wait two weeks and that's what my appointments consist of. "
"I got diagnosed with that in 2020 and it's like, I couldn't breathe. I went to my cardiologist, I was at my cardiologist a couple times and one of the nurses saw me having a hard time breathing so they ended up referring me to a cardiologist. I mean, a pulmonologist."
"They just take an ultrasound, they just do it on ultrasound just like they would like whenever you're having a baby  pictures of the baby."
"Well, it's either, he says it's good or it's bad. Like last time I went in... No two years ago I went in, they ended up doing the EECP on me. It's this thing that I was telling you about that they put on your legs, because he said I had blockage and it took the blockage away."
"Where they had it go real fast and they  with some kind of medicine. Yeah, I did not like that."
That's pretty much it. And I have my dog and that's pretty much it. My dad and mom passed away already so it's just me here. But I do plan on moving to where my kids are in the next year or two.
"Well, not too good. I've had a hard time breathing lately. But I also got diagnosed with COPD, so I don't know if it's the congestive heart failure or the COPD."
"That was in 2020, because I was on one of those CPAP machines."
"I thought congestive heart failure was bad, it's nothing compared to COPD."
"C O P D is like you can't breathe. In fact, my pulmonologist wants me to get a lung... What's it called? A lung transplant."
"Well, whenever I first got divorced I was diagnosed with depression. Let's see, what else? COPD, congestive heart failure, a heart attack, had a quadruple bypass, I don't know which heart problems, I guess you could say. I guess that's it."
So here's where they did the surgery for the quadruple bypass.
"But anyway... Yeah, I don't know if you can see my leg."
See my leg? Can you see my leg? Where they did the surgery?
Well they did like the emergency surgery.
That's part of the heart surgery. They used that vein and put it in my heart.
Well they did it for both legs.
"Oh yeah. See him if like, I have like pneumonia or something like that."
"Yes, because my COPD is bad. It's like... What's it called? Level four."
"They say a woman's always is different from a man as of having a heart attack, but only thing that happened to me is like the plum in the chest and that was it. It was the only sign that I can think of, but yeah, I didn't have any signs at all."
"Well, I bring up my kid every now and then. They're mainly concerned about my COPD also."
The heart... I can't really remember-
"No, not the scar but the heart... Oh, shoot. Okay, let me think. Yeah, the scar, but I had to be real careful washing it and stuff."
"I never really asked the cardiologist what happened. Now with the congestive heart failure I was like, okay, what is it?"
"I don't remember what they told me. All I remember is they're like something about blood pumping or something like that, to the arteries or something like that."
"It is problems with your heart getting blood to the arteries, I guess. I don't really know how to explain it."
"Oh, on this Facebook group I belong to, congestive heart failure people."
"I just Googled it in Facebook, the congestive heart failure groups and that's how I found it."
"Yeah, it's helpful but I don't know. I pretty much deal with my COPD now more and I do the congestive heart failure."
"I mean, as of in my head. Because the COPD I'm like stage four on the COPD and if I lose so much oxygen, I could pass away. And so that scares me a lot because I want to see my grand babies and..."
"Well, I take like metropolol for my heart. Well, you saw the medicines that I take."
So I didn't send my ProAir and all that other stuff. Oh yeah.
"CQ10 is for my heart, it is a vitamin. It's a vitamin. Prednisone is for my breathing in case I need it, but I try not to take it because I've gained like 20 pounds from taking prednisone. I do not like it. Albuterol is this right here."
"It's for my breathing. It's for my breathing. It's medicine that I put for my breathing. Simvastatin, I'm not sure if that's for my cholesterol or for my blood pressure, but it's one of those. Melatonin is for my sleeping problems. Symbicort is-"
"Well, he also put me on some heart medicine to where I couldn't have a heart attack because it's like, I haven't been able to exercise as much since I've gotten COPD."
"Well, I can't remember which one is the... I have a high blood pressure pill and also a depressive pill I'm still on. And I think that's the E S C I T A L O P R M pill for the depressive. That shows how much I don't never take medicine, so."
"The only thing that's been added that's new from my cardiologist is this heart attack pills to keep me from hopefully getting a heart attack because I can't exercise like I used to, I have COPD. That's the only thing new that they've given me."
"I guess, because of almost dying and having congestive heart failure and... I don't know."
"They're worried about, because I was breathing weird. So that's when they went ahead and set me up an appointment, referred me."
"Yeah. They noticed it, right. One of the nurses noticed it that does my, like I say, the baby treatment. Does my heart, take pictures of my heart like they do for an ultrasound, she does that for my heart and my legs."
"No, because some of the time I'm also doing the EECP."
"I think they're allowed to do that like maybe a year. I don't really know, but all I know is they check my blood pressure and all this other stuff, make sure everything's working, my medicines."
I asked them what my ejection fraction is.
So 40%. And that's how he come he told me I'm like a mild case.
"He just says I don't have to do the water pills, that's just what he said to me. I don't know how come he thinks I'm a mild case."
"It's fine. It doesn't really bother me. Not as much as the COPD does, the COPD bothers me a lot."
"Honestly, I don't know. I mean, I've had a good experience. I mean, I don't have water pills, a lot of people have to take those all the time and I'm glad I'll have to do those. I guess the only thing I did not like ever since was the-"
When I thought I was having a heart attack?
"Tell me, I was like, I was fine. All they did was take my blood and the reason they took the blood is to make sure to find out about if I was having a heart attack or anything."
Yeah. All they did was do that every three hours and then take my blood pressure and that's pretty much it .there's nothing they could tell me because there was nothing wrong with me.
"It's like a curse. It's exhausting. They refer to it as an elephant on your chest, but it's more than that you can't breathe. It's an elephant on your whole being, because your mind can do so much, but your breath doesn't give your body the ability to keep up, with what your mind is doing. And it's hard. Can't focus on that though."
"It's not pleasant to be out of breath so automatically you would avoid doing anything that makes you out of breath which of course, begets more being out of breath, but that's another story. But everything that you have to do, you stop. And it's like, ""I can't do that. Wait, can I do?"" And you have to think about the logistics. Even before, when I had to come upstairs to get my computer, I've learned to be calm about that. That would've thrown me into anxiety a couple of years ago. So you think about everything you do because you don't want to get stuck in a situation where it's red alert and you can't breathe and you can't handle it and you're stuck."
"Terrifying when you can't get air. I just remember one time that was particularly bad. I couldn't get the air. It wasn't coming in. My chest tightens, just thinking about it. And I thought to myself, I'm going to let myself pass out because I can't take this. And I remember writing on a piece of paper because I couldn't even speak ""Call 911,"" and giving it to my husband because nobody knew what was going on. And that's one of many times, that's the worst."
"I was only brought to the hospital twice. I've been in the hospital, I don't know, maybe a dozen times or more. I can't even count. I can't even tell you. Only twice I went by ambulance. One time I drove myself. Other times I think I even let one of my daughters drive me once. My husband drove me and you get better at it. You know the deal. And by going to the same hospital, they have my records and they know what works with me and they can immediately give me things that normally they'd have to mess around with, ""Oh, we gave this to her the last time,"" which is good and bad. It doesn't show any attention to maybe it's a different situation presenting itself. I don't know. But at least you get quicker treatment that way. And when you stay in the hospital all those times, they pump you up with medication that makes you crazy, steroids to the point of..."
"It's the best drug because then you can breathe but the worst drug because you can't sleep. You just feel nasty and cranky and you want to kill somebody and you reach a point that... I've reached a point several times where I said, ""I don't want that drug anymore. You gave me enough of this already. Can't we slow down on that?"" ""We're writing it in your charts that you're refusing the drug."" Because every time you're in the hospital too, they want to stick you in the stomach with that drug to prevent blood clots. But I wasn't in bed. I was pacing all night with my steroids. So, but I finally said ""I don't want that."" And being in the hospital is... That's weird. It's good and it's bad. You disappeared."
"Where was I? The drugs, better, but you have to know when to stop with them. There's a point that they need to be able to wean you better off those drugs, because they just hop you up and create other problems and it's very exhausting and every time you come out of the hospital, you're taken out. Like if you were at a level of here, you come out of the hospital and you're here, you could spend the next however many months working yourself almost up then going to the hospital again, which always knocks you down a little lower again. You're struggling and it's a constant battle. The key is not to ever have to be hospitalized. And that's my goal in life, as unrealistic as it sounds."
"Well, I take my rescue inhaler here and there, as needed. Sometimes I take nebulized albuterol, that's if I'm not feeling well, but I haven't done that in a long while. I take, I have to say TRELEGY. It's a LABA, a LAMA and a corticosteroid, I think. I didn't want to use the wrong words. And that's why I gave you the drug name too."
"And then things like Mucinex, which is really important for the mucus. And sometimes cough pills, sometimes anxiety pills. I consider the anxiety due to the COPD. I didn't have anxiety until... It took a while for me to realize what COPD meant. And it took me a while to realize that I had developed anxiety. I couldn't accept either, I guess."
"Certainly any new activity that I would have to do by myself. I do go places by myself, but if I had to go somewhere new by myself at this point, I would avoid it, which is wrong I know, because I probably can do it. I avoid a lot of things, like I don't go anywhere. I could use COVID as an excuse, but I'm afraid to go anywhere. I wouldn't go to the grocery or to Target or to Kohl's or any of my normal haunts and I'm not saying I'm saving money by not going there because I can shop my brains out, in my pajamas online. So you become like a hermit."
"Can I go out and ride my bicycle? I rode it to the corner. I didn't like that. I was out of breath and was afraid to go further because I guess it's something I'm not used to, riding with oxygen on your back. And it's just, I'd like to do that too. I'd like to say ""Sure, have the grandkids come over and I'll take care of them and we'll stay up all night baking brownies."" Oy. And this all happened so fast. I went from, I was the one in control of everything, to now just getting by. Yes, I can shower myself. I can take myself to the doctor. I can get up and down the stairs. You can leave me alone unsupervised, but it takes away a lot of who I am."
"Okay. The reason I must say, that my biggest goal in life is not to be hospitalized, is because you're strong. You're good. And now you have an exacerbation and you land up, in the hospital and you are fighting to breathe and they're destroying you with the steroids. You're a mess, but it's time to go home. So now here you are, all the way down here. You have to go home, struggle your way back up, to not even where you were before and two months later, again an exacerbation. You're in the hospital. Again, they knock the heck out of you until there's nothing left and now you're even lower and they send you home. You got to work it up, exercise, eat right. It's exhausting. It's a constant battle."
"They don't realize that unless they've been through it, because I myself did not realize that. And I wish there was a handbook for COPD people and that would be included in... I remember my doctor saying to me in the beginning, first time I was hospitalized, ""Well, we'll keep you out of the hospital,"" but you know what? He didn't explain why. And if he explained why, I might have fought harder to stay out of the hospital, I would've washed my hands more. This mask wearing, I hate it. It's great. You know, don't talk to anybody. Don't kiss or hug. It's all good. I haven't been in the hospital for a year and a half now."
"I'm coming from a severe point of view. I have severe COPD. Maybe there's enough for people with mild to moderates. I don't know what that is. If that's what I had before I had this and I didn't know it, I guess it's okay. Maybe there's enough for them, but there's not enough for people with severe COPD because we are really suffering. And the only thing is a lung transplant, which has another list of issues going with it. So I can't decide which issues I prefer to have more."
"But the thing is, if I had known I had COPD before I was severe and out of control, maybe I could have started then to do something about it. Well, would I believe them and still been sassy like I was? I don't know. But if I had known earlier that exercise, which I've never done my whole life, makes a difference, would I have done it? Would I have stopped smoking earlier? I remember a pulmonologist many years ago saying to me, ""If you stop smoking, you can reverse the damage to your lungs now."" Hey, yo, I was however old, must have been in my forties. ""No, thank you."" Why didn't he explain to me? I didn't know what COPD was. I actually didn't know until I got it. I never understood. And that's why it's important that you want to explain to doctors how we feel people, they should know, because I don't think they understand and I think there should be earlier interventions."
"Okay. As far as treatment options, I think that there's a need for more treatment options for people with, I don't know about moderate, but certainly severe COPD. It's very hard to manage, with what they have available. I know because I'm on the optimum amount of medication that they would give to a person like me. That's the other thing. It's not one-size-fits-all. And I think that we need more options because different people react differently to different drugs. And the other thing is, I think that there should be earlier intervention with the medications, perhaps avoiding people from getting to that severe level and stopping this in a more moderate range."
"Okay. I think that they need to know that not all patients are the same. You can't go with the gold standard. Each of us need to be looked at, as individuals, because we react differently to different medications, different treatment options. Our anxiety levels are different. Our family lifestyles and support groups are different. We're all different and we need to be treated differently. Also there should be education so that we can be treated sooner in our disease cycle. They need to know. And that we don't want to be suffering in the severe range. It's bad enough that it's mild to moderate. Let's keep it there and let's treat earlier and make people aware of what their disease is, and what can be done to help."
"Coughing, my scratchy throat is from the medications because of the COPD. I'm exhausted. And the big one of course, which I leave for last, is I'm short of breath."
"And that's it on the meds, I think."
"No, I was told, ""You have severe COPD there."" ""Okay. But I'm okay, I just had an asthma attack,"" so you know, I didn't get it. No, I did not understand the seriousness of it until things started to spiral out of control. Nobody explained to me. No."
"During COVID, the only thing to do that was healthy for us was to get out and hike... away from people. And so over the last two years I built my stamina up quite well. But I was just recently diagnosed with central sensitization syndrome and fibromyalgia. And so a lot of these extra things that were coming on when I decided to finally stop working, we now know why I was in pain and all these little weird quirky things that I always just thought was heart failure. Because, I'm in a lot of heart failure groups online and people talk about the pain. They're in pain a lot and it's not something people... Doctors don't usually say, ""Oh. Well, it's connected to heart failure."" But all of us have a lot of pain and we always think it's due to the lack of the oxygen flow and the blood flow, the way it should be."
"So, getting stamina backup takes a lot more work and trying to fight through pain that's there, that comes from other things. But I do all our cooking, scratch cooking, and I do a lot of online helping out in groups. One of the largest, low-sodium groups on Facebook, I help manage it. I'm an admin. I'm an admin. And then heart groups and stuff, that's how I found out about this study too, was one of our other admins. Ashley let me know about it. That's why I was like, ""This type of thing is great,"" because people that have had it for long enough, they can look back and help others by... Make sure you're advocating for yourself when you doc-"
"Let the doctors know. I need to know the exact amount of sodium I can have, not just, ""Don't eat salt."" Exact amount of fluids, because people come into our groups and they're like, ""They said I can't have any salt. Everything has salt, what am I going to eat?"""
"But a lot of patients come in and they have no clue or they're on meds that they have no clue what their meds are doing. They're just hear, ""Take this, take that, take this."" So that's my hobby, where I'm always trying to help other people out starting their journey."
"My heart failure is pretty well controlled. I have not... I'm trying to think. The last time I was in the hospital for anything was January, before COVID hit. And I was in. We're pretty sure I had COVID, because I had all these lung issues. My cardiologist thought, ""Well, maybe you're fluid full."" And I'm like, ""No, pretty sure I'm not."" He's like, ""Well, maybe you lost some weight and don't realize it."" And you've got all this extra fluid. I'm like, ""No, I don't think so."" So took a Metolazone, because he said take a Metolazone. And that didn't help the lack of breathing, because my oxygen would drop really low."
"So they threw me in the hospital. And so my cardiologist put me in, but it was a pulmonologist issue that we were dealing with. But I have not even had to call my cardiologist. And other than that, during that, they always want me to check in with him. I haven't been in for an echo or anything, because he knows I'll call if there's an issue. So my weights continued to drop without having to work too hard at it now. So I'm really quite well controlled. I follow my meds exactly, follow my restrictions."
"What is it? They have me listed as kidney disease, but it's more so that I have sensitive kidneys from the beginning years of my heart failure. Having the diuretics, the fluids would go up and down and my kidneys would just buck. I don't even have nephrologist."
"Not to that point, it's listed as an in my charts, but it's not something that... The only time that I ever see a kidney person is if I'm in the hospital and they're trying to yank all the fluid out of me, he comes in and says, ""Pump the brakes a bit there."""
"Because, I know if I go to my internal med doc, she's just going to send me off to see one of those anyways. But I usually try to have my doctors... If I go see my pulmonologist, I usually try to have her CC in my cardiologist into the notes, so that he can see like, ""Oh. Well, we're having some issues with the lungs."" And he can follow up if he feels he needs to after seeing her notes. To me that's a big thing, is having a good care team that I can communicate amongst themselves."
"And I know that my sister had been diagnosed with fibro years and years ago. And so she said... She's a lab tech, so she's a traveling lab tech. And she was like, ""Neurology would be who you want to see."" And she actually told me to go to the doctor she saw before. And he instantly... I went in, I wrote down every symptom that was different than what my heart failure, my diabetes, things that were above and beyond what I've been dealing with everything else. And he got those sheets and it didn't take him long to figure out what was going on. I didn't have to go have a ton of tests and all that done."
"Pulmonologist, I have to see her once a year for my sleep apnea for the insurance to continue to take care of the machine and stuff for that. Internal med, I only see her, usually it was every three months for my A1C and stuff, but I just talked to them this morning and she said, ""No, she doesn't want to see you for six months."" ."
"Well, prior to 2015, somewhere back in my charts, and I can't remember the exact time, there's a note about where I had a doctor that thought there was an inkling or something with my heart. And I can't find the notes and stuff exactly. But then nothing from there. But I had been dealing with years of waking up with headaches in the morning, which was the sleep apnea. And I worked an active job, I bartended, and ran laps around a big bar five nights a week. Active and doing stuff, but my ankles would swell up to the size of softballs, and just ache. My husband would rub them every night, and I'd wake up and they just felt bruised, because the water, after you sleep, it would start coming out."
"But that was always a problem. And I was going through... I thought it was just asthma. I was going through inhalers, like emergency inhalers. I was going through two or three of them a month, because I was so short of breath doing stuff, and I thought that was just normal. I just thought my asthma wasn't very well controlled. And I had gone to..."
"I had went to Woman of Faith, a big conference thing. And by this point I was trying to wear some compression hose, just some cheap compression hose, I was trying to just help with the ankles swelling a little bit. I had been to doctors for the headaches. I'd been to doctors for the ankles and they all just said, ""Drink more water and lose some weight."""
"General doctors that I had seen up in Bloomer. Boy, that was a hard one. Just my general doctors and stuff that I had seen. My mom drove me into the urgent care one time, because I had such bad headaches. She's like, ""We got to find out what's going on."" And they just, ""Oh, we don't see anything. Get your neck adjusted."" Or one of them said, ""Oh, you must have a sinus infection."" They were just stabbing at things, and no one ever looked. Honestly, no one ever looked deeper than my weight to see what the underlying cause was. And I had gone to this concert thing, it was like a three day event, and I was doing pretty good up there. He can't have drinks and stuff in there so I hadn't hardly drank anything."
"And at that time I had no clue that I should not be drinking a lot of water, because I used to drink easily over a gallon of water a day, because the doctors were telling me, ""Drink more water."" So I went to this event, and somebody at the event that rode with us felt like she was getting a cold on the way back. And within a couple days of me getting home, I started feeling like I couldn't breathe. And I directly went to my asthma protocol and I used my nebulizer and did all of those types of things, and it wasn't getting better. It wasn't getting better. Went to urgent care. They didn't have treatments on me and said, ""No, you need to go to the hospital, because we're not sure why you're not getting better airflow."""
"And I spent like 11 hours in the ER that night. And they started to nebulizers, they checked for me for a pulmonary embolism, and just started running all these things. And I had a doctor come in. One of the doctors came in and first she's like, ""Had anybody ever told you about a pulmonary embolism?"" I'm like, ""Nope."" And he left, walked out the door. And then a while later I can't remember all the tests, because it was a whirlwind. They came in and he's like, "" Had anybody ever talk to you about heart failure before?"" I'm like, ""No, but I might be in it right now."" Because, you don't want to hear that. I was 40."
"And so from there it was like, bam, bam, bam. I was in a room and on diuretics, and they dropped 30 pounds of fluid out of me in eight days with diuretics. Which, of course, my kidneys weren't happy about. But it was weird, because as soon as we had answers, it was like everything fell into place. Why the headaches, why I couldn't breathe? Why the asthma was the way it was. Now I'm on two inhalers for my asthma, that I take daily, and I never need a rescue inhaler, Unless I'm sick, because it's so well controlled. Which is good, because now I know if I can't breathe, it's likely because I'm fluid for a little bit. But that doesn't usually happen. But since I've been diagnosed, I've been able to lose weight, I suppose, because my heart's not hurting so bad from the fluids and the sodium and stuff. But it was a rocky start there."
"Like I said, a lot of in and out of the hospital, just trying to get... I would either get fluid full or there were times where, because of the diuretics, so I would have to take, we call it my kicker pill, the Metolazone. I was really sensitive to the Metolazone. The joke with my cardiologist now is when I need it, just take a lick and put it back in the bottle, because I would take the dose that I was supposed to and I would end up still fluid full, but dehydrated. So vascularly versus tissue. And that was my magic trick, to be both at the same time. Rocky start on that one. And I've had a couple times since then that I've had that issue happen. But now it's like I can go and eat pizza and not blow up like a balloon, because I don't do it all the time."
"Yeah. And the sleep apnea, that we now know, I was waking up in the middle of the night and I'd sit up on the edge of my bed, just not realizing what was going on. I didn't know anything about sleep apnea. And then I would fall back asleep. Sometimes I'd fall forward and almost hit my dresser. Other times I'd just fall backwards onto the of bed. I was waking up with headaches so bad that I would get up, sit in my recliner with ice packs wrapped all around my head and fall back asleep out there, not knowing that it was also making it easier for me to breathe, because I was sitting upright. I wasn't getting drowned by all the fluids that were in my system. So yeah. It was a slow progression, but I know that it was started right there, because that's when I was bartending. And I just figured it was because I was on my feet all the time for my job too, that my ankles were swelling, because they were swelling worse than they were when I was pregnant."
"Well, a lot of the times it was the headache and the ankles. And they would often touch my calf or my ankle and be like, ""Oh. Well, that's not very much."" They would give the pitting a certain degree, and they're like, ""Oh, that's not that bad."" But they never got to see me when I had gotten to be off my feet all day, and my ankles were the normal size they were, because I've always had small ankles for the size of me. I'm 5'8, and I'm bigger build. And so they never saw when my ankles were completely empty."
"Because, back then, I didn't know. There was no, ""Well, lay off the sodium."" Or they didn't do... My blood pressures were never really bad, even with the heart failure. Calvin said, I take... He has me on the Losartan mostly just to help my heart be able to work a little better with being the diastolic. But my numbers, I've never had high blood pressure. So don't know if they looked at that and figured, ""Well, it can't be anything heart related."" I don't know why they just sloughed it off. But it was always just, ""Oh. Well, lose some more weight."" And I tried and I couldn't. I battled my weight my entire adult life. Now I don't even try, and I probably sit more than I'm up doing stuff, and the weight's just... It's not falling off fast, but I haven't gained any. I think I've lost over 60 pounds. Granted, it's taken six years, but I've never gained."
"Back in those days it was... I had a doctor do an x-ray of my neck, and that's the one that told me that I had a sinus infection. It was just a sinus infection causing the headaches. Because, like I said, I had no idea that the not breathing, my asthma, was just due to my heart, for the most part."
"And so they would doll out my inhalers left and right, like no big deal, and never gave me any other kinds of inhalers, because, like I said, now I'm on two and I have not a problem. So yeah. It was just very well ill managed, no scraping the surface deeper than my weight."
"And luckily that is changing a bit, I don't know about other care places, but I know Mayo has started giving their doctors and nurses and stuff training on how to not fat shame, basically. Don't treat the fat only and not look below the surface to what other issues could possibly be causing it. My husband said that a lot of them had to have been doing that training and stuff, because apparently this has become a very common thing. People are getting misdiagnosed and getting way sicker."
"If I would've been done diagnosed 15 years earlier, how much better would my quality of life be now had I been able to do all this stuff back then? My body wouldn't have been through all the hell that it's been through not being healthier. But yeah, we hear a lot of stories of they're sent here, they're sent there, and it's never like, ""Let's look at your heart. Let's look at your labs, and see what your heart markers are doing. What's your creat, and how's your lungs, are they happy? And they wait until there's an issue, a big issue that says, ""Oh, look at the heart."" Or a heart attack, or something like that, before you see a cardiologist."
"The way I explained it to people after I learned about it was that your heart does this... and that's your ejection fraction, how hard your heart squeezes out. And people that have systolic heart failure, their heart doesn't squeeze as hard. So the blood ends up pooling and stuff, because of that. Where my heart squeezes just fine, but it doesn't relax and open up to fill all the way up with the blooding. So ejects, but it's not ejecting at the same amount of fluid through. So that's why I pool. So I tell everybody to have an uptight heart. And that's another thing, a lot of people come into these groups and they're not told what kind of heart failure they have."
"It was eight days before I went home. They were able to get enough fluid out of my system that my oxygen levels were holding on their own without having to be on oxygen. They were making me do walks with the nurses, with the Pulse Socks on, to see if when I was up and moving, I was holding my oxygen levels good."
"Honestly, I don't remember much other than peeing a lot, because they just had me on IV diuretics. You know IV diuretics? I know one of the things that I battled a lot from that forward was I had a horrible time keeping my potassium levels up due to the diuretics. But then I was put on pill potassium, that didn't work. So I had to go on liquid potassium and that wasn't doing real well, because it made my stomach upset. So I was in the bathroom anyways. And so it goes right through. Now I'm not on any, because I just control it by making sure I'm eating my avocados and anything food wise to keep my potassium levels up. I also don't pee nearly as much now, because I'm not putting all that into my system."
"But yeah, it was eight days. I know that, like I said, I had kidney doctors in there watching, because my kidneys started to get... My creat numbers and stuff were starting to get weird and the levels just weren't right. So it was a lot of .adjusting and figuring out I started on one month for diuretic and after a while that just wasn't working. And so then I got switched to Torsemide, which is what I've been on primarily for... Gosh, I don't even know how long. But that, like I said, it seems to be working. Part of me these last few months, I've been like, ""Well, I'm doing so well. Maybe we can lower the amount."" But then I'm like, ""No, I'm doing so well less not mess with it."""
"Tramadol's for pain, which I don't take much now, because it doesn't play well with the Amitriptyline. The Amitriptyline's a antidepressant that was given to me by the neurologist, because it's found to help with pain with fibro patients. Somehow or another, it helps that receptor not work. Right? Metformin for diabetes. B-Complex, D3 and zinc. Just keep my immune system up to battle the COVIDs. Where else am I? Yeah. Oh, the B-Complex, I started taking because it helps with nerves. And so it helps with my feet issues. So yeah, the zinc, the vitamin D3, and the vitamin C, and the calcium is all just vitamins. Alprazolam, I don't really take much of that. It's for anxiety. My Advair, my Ventolin and my Spiriva are all asthma."
"Febuxostat is Uloric, which is for the gout to keep my uric acid levels down. My Torsemide is my diuretic. My main diuretic. Glipizide is for diabetes. Spironolactone is another diuretic. But he put it on there, because it's also a potassium sparing diuretic. And so just trying to keep my potassium from plummeting down. And Metolazone is an as needed. It's part of my care plan with, with Dr. Calvin, my cardiologist. If I start getting... If I gain the two pounds, two days in a row or the five over a week, my first line of defense is let him know, I crush it, then I take a couple little flakes of it."
"And I guess it's just old hack now for me to do it. It's just I know what I take when I take it, and I'm really good about keeping up with making sure my meds are always refilled and I've got to refill more things. Prescriptions for my doctor, if I need updates on them. Like some of these that are an as needed type thing, it's just really listening to my body and knowing now what I need when I need it. I don't know. I've always been one to really listen to what's going on with my system. But I don't play around with the Torsemide, I keep it at the 80 milligrams two times a day. I hear a lot of people on our heart failure boards where they're on like a... They might take only 20 milligrams of Torsemide daily, but their doctor will be like, ""But if you're feeling like you think you might be a little fluid folding, then go ahead and take another one."""
"Originally, I was Lenzapro, and I was only on it for a short bit, because I got the cough from it. It's a side effect that seems, in our groups, to be a very common one. And a lot of the times we tell people to talk to your... If you're getting a cough like that, after starting that med, talk to your doctor right away, because there's other options he can give you that maybe you won't react to. And as soon as he switched to my Losartan, I was fine."
"And we were having to up the dose quite frequently, and we got to a point where we were at the highest dose you should be taking and it just wasn't keeping me level. And that was even after I was pretty well, good with my sodiums and my fluids and things like that. I was having to take Metolazone like once a month just to get myself level back out again. So that's when we switched me to Torsemide. I think we automatically went to the 80 milligrams twice a day, because that was the equivalent of the med for the dose I was on for Furosemide. He said that seems to be common. Your body gets used to one diuretic and just changing the... Same mechanics of the bed, but changing a different one. And that's all it took to give to be able to level back out."
"The first couple years where I was in and out of the hospital, of course, I always had to go see them after I'd been in the hospital stay, so it was fairly frequent. But then, like I said, after we got leveled out I was having echoes every six months for the first few years. And then it went down to only needing to be once a year. And now apparently he's forgotten all about me. No. I haven't had one in two years. I can't remember if I had an echo when I was in the hospital at the beginning of COVID. I think I did, but that's because... Yeah. I saw him after the hospital stay because... They did an echo, because they put me on heavy... Sorry."
"They put me on heavy steroids, because I wasn't breathing well. And the steroids caused my blood sugar numbers to go through the roof, and so then they transferred me to another unit, where they had me on a insulin drip and the insulin drip dropped my numbers so fast, and somewhere in the combination of all of that, it dropped my potassium through the floor. And I know sooner got done with the all night poking of the fingers and I tried to sleep, and I went... I had Tachycardia. Is that what is? All of a sudden my heart just... because the potassium drops so fast and so low. So I remember they did come in and do an echo then. So my last echo was January? January, beginning of February, somewhere in there. And then I saw him, and since then I said, ""Yeah, they put me in the hospital and they tried to kill me."" I joke with my doctors a lot. So I haven't seen him since probably February 2020."
"Not a lot. It'd be nice to see what it is now that I've been so controlled. The last two years, not having to go in, not having to talk to them. There wasn't much fluctuation. And I don't know that might be why he's not having to do the echos every year, because we know nothing's really changed."
"It's my doctors, I had a cardiologist nurse that used to call me towards the beginning, or if I had a big issue where I was in the hospital, I would get put back on those. She would call me once a week and check in and see how I was doing. And I just learned to ask a lot of questions. Don't be afraid to ask those questions of your doctors or their nurses, their care team. I did a lot of... The heart, the sodium and things like that. I learned a lot from my groups, from my low sodium groups, how to eat good foods still without eating cardboard. My heart failure groups, I've learned some, but a lot of it, like I went on the American Heart Association page and they've got really great info charts and stuff to explain. Diastolic versus systolic, and what you should check every day."
"Because, Google will jack you all up. So just educating myself, just doing that. If I have a new symptom or something like that, I don't go in and be like, ""Oh my gosh, what is this?"" If I have a new symptom, I go to my doctor first and say, ""Hey, this is weird. This' something new that I haven't dealt with with this."" And he tells me that's just something normal. It's okay. Then I'm like, ""Okay."" Then you go in and you can talk in those groups and be like, ""Has anybody else experienced this?"" And then you find out, ""Oh yeah. Oh my gosh, this is normal with everybody."""
"Like I put in the sheet that I filled out for you, is better... It's easy to have a nutritionist come in when you're diagnosed with heart failure and say, ""Don't eat salt."" And the nutritionists that they send into a heart patient needs to be different than they send into somebody else, because they really don't educate them very well. Doctors need to be more specific and make sure that they are giving. Don't just tell somebody they have a restriction, they need an exact amount, because we have patients that come into our groups and they're like, ""I can't eat any salt."" And they're literally trying not to take any salt in, at all, and they're ending up with too little salt. Next thing you know, we hear that they're in the hospital because their sodium levels just weren't there anymore."
"Better education on the restrictions. Looking past somebody's weight is a really big one, because heart failure doesn't care what size you are. We have people that are joggers. I had a friend, MM... She did the boxing and stuff, and she ended up with heart failure. Out of the... You know. She was healthy. She ate healthy and trained."
"Well, officially, I stopped working two years ago, just because I had lots of things going on besides just my heart failure that we figured it was time for me to just stay home and take care of me."
"And since then my heart failure has gotten so much better, because I'm able to well control everything. You're home, you rest when you need to, you put your feet up when you need to."
"She knows all about grandma's heart failure. She's visited me in the hospitals. She always brings me hearts. She says, ""Here's a new heart for you, Grandma."""
"Hobbies. When the weather's good up here in Wisconsin, we try to get out and we geocache, hike the trails, stuff like that, as much as we can do. Not working the last two years, my body, I try to get out and walk to get my..."
"But yeah. So like I said, it's following the meds, because I'm on a pretty high dose, diuretics, and my Losartan, I take daily. I just stick to my regimen and it keeps me good."
"So my fibromyalgia is more of an issue now than my heart failure, which seems odd."
"It's a new thing out there, they can't even put a billing code or a diagnostic code on it, called central sensitization syndrome."
Or CSS. It's a big umbrella for a lot of the things that fibro for... It used to be they said fibro for everything. Now they're realizing that fibro is just one in a bunch of other things that all have to do with the wrong signals being sent.
"So learning a little bit about that. And if you're trying to figure out, I'm on new meds for that that make me sleep a lot, but that's good, because my heart seems happier when I sleep more."
"Oh, geez. Want the list? I've had asthma pretty much my whole life."
"Sleep apnea, which the sleep apnea diagnosis came right after my heart failure diagnosis."
"My cardiologist is pretty sure that I've had long term sleep apnea that was undiagnosed and that's what injured my heart enough to have... Because, I've always been a heavier set girl, but I was super active."
"So, Asthma, sleep apnea. I take meds for gout, because I had two bouts of gout back when I was first diagnosed with our failure."
Oh my gosh. My brain just completely left me.
"So the fibro... Dear, gosh, I should have just put my list up. Okay. Do you disappear when I go to look something up? No,"
"Yep. I have my diagnosis dates. My heart failure was... I got to check. Because, the day I went into the hospital for it is not the same day that they put the diagnosis in my chart."
"So 11/18 of 2015. It was put in hypertensive heart with heart failure and chronic kidney disease, stage three. And then it's also listed chronic diastolic, a heart failure on 11/18."
"It took a while to get that diagnosed, because getting in for sleep studies takes forever. So it's actually not listed in here until September of 2017."
But I know that I had sleep studies prior. I was so bad that it took them over two sleep studies to be able to get it diagnosed.
Not before the heart failure. That was actually after.
"I'm trying to look where the heck that date is. That was in 2018, that it was first, but I wasn't on any meds until like 2019."
"And that too was one of those things that the gout doctor said it was due to the constant shift in my fluids, because I was in and out of the hospital so much during the first few months."
"Just trying to get some meds right and figuring out the whole sodium and all of that kind of stuff. I had two bouts back-to-back. Had one one month, and then I had one the next month. And then I got on meds and I haven't had one since."
"My internal med doctor can oversee and she can handle refills for my meds. Yeah. If I know that I'm dealing with something to do within my heart, I usually will call cardiology."
"If I'm dealing with my lungs, or my asthma, or my sleep stuff, I call my pulmonologist. So I have a really good care team."
But knowing who you should call for what issues.
"Internal medicine is the general overall and the... When I started having all these weird issues happening, I went to see my internal med doctor first."
"And she ran some studies and said, ""Well, this isn't something that we can handle."" And she sent me off to neurology. And then neurology are the ones that actually diagnosed me, because it wasn't anything in her realm of just general issues to handle."
When I was having all the issues with... I was having issues with my hands and my feet falling asleep. I was having-
"The inability. My husband can't even put his arm over me without it hurting, things like that."
"That's my main team. I've seen... Just brain fried. For rheumatoid arthritis, when I was dealing with my gout, I saw him, but I don't see him anymore because I've been so well controlled with the med."
"Right. Because, he sees if I'm going to other places. So it used to be once a year, I'd go in for my echo and then see him. And I haven't had one of those in two years. So... To do."
"Yeah. I told her, ""No, I want my A1C checked right now, 'cause I'm having issues."""
"So they were doing a comparison based on the rest of my body rather than what... ""Oh no, that's not very swelled at all."" And I'm thinking, ""Dear gosh. Yes, it is."""
"If they did, it was probably just a basic metabolic panel."
If that. I don't remember getting a lot of lab work.
"Yeah. We hear a lot of ones where things have been off for years. And same, a lot of stories like mine too were they looked at your weight, they didn't look at your health."
"That's a very memorable day, because he walked in and said, ""You don't look like a 70 year old man."" Because, diastolic heart failure is more common with men apparently than women. So."
"Well, it was that first thing. Has anybody ever talked to you about heart failure?"
"And so in the ER, at that point, they didn't say, ""This is what you have."" Okay. I was talked to and explained about what HFpEF was and stuff from Calvin when he came and met me."
I wasn't sure if you just wanted the heart ones or not. So I just gave you it all.
The Losartan's for my heart failure.
"And I'm like, ""That's dangerous."" I think dangerous to do to somebody that's freshly into heart failure, because you can panic take meds and then hurt yourself the other way by drying yourself out too much."
"Yeah. I was lucky my husband hurt his shoulder at work and he was out of work for a little over a year. So through the hardest, like the beginning hits of COVID, he was even in the hospital. So we luckily were able to stay away from people."
Same meds. I want to say I was on Furosemide for my diuretic in the beginning.
"Other than that, those are the only two that I really take, well, the Spironolactone, that I really take for managing my heart failure."
"You're welcome. I am so glad to be able to try to, any way, shape or form, help the next person. Because, it doesn't have to be a life sentence. You don't have to just huddle in a corner, because you have heart failure."
"Okay. Well, I'm going to ask you a question that sounds a lot like another question I asked you, but I want to make sure that I get this exactly from your perspective. What limitations do you have to everyday life and activities, due to the fear of having a severe event or severe shortness of breath?"
"Okay. Now I'm going to ask you again about treatment options and I would like for you to say, ""I would wish there were more COPD treatment options because..."" And you say that because I just want to make sure we get that first part in, that you're saying it, because I won't be in the video, just you."
"Okay. Very good. I just wanted to make sure that we had the treatment option in your voice. Okay, so that was great. So one last question and I think this is one that you may have to reflect on just a minute. Is there anything you would like to share with my AstraZeneca colleagues regarding having COPD? What do you think people need to know? Physicians and pharmacists and healthcare providers. From your perspective, Jody."
My first question is what does it feel like for you to have COPD?
"Oh, I appreciate it. And your honesty is completely appreciated in this recording. So what limitations to everyday life and activities do you have because of your COPD?"
"Right, so what symptoms do you generally have with your COPD?"
"Right, how often do you have symptoms?"
Okay. So have you ever had where your symptoms got so bad that you couldn't deal with it?
"Well, that sounds like a good one to me. Okay. So do you take daily medicines for your COPD?"
"Okay. And do you know what kind, you don't have to tell me the exact names, but what kinds of medicines you take?"
"That is good news. That's really good news. Okay. So this question I haven't asked you, and I'm going to ask you the same question twice, but first, do you feel that there is a lack of treatment options for COPD? Do you feel like that?"
"When you were diagnosed with COPD, were you educated about the disease at that time?"
"You can say whatever you want to, just start it with, about treatment options or something."
"I don't know if you've ever talked to people that's ever said that after they've had a main surgery, it's like it's food does not taste right. But it's like I did not eat for a good two weeks after I got home from the hospital. I mean I tried, but it's like nothing tastes good."
"I'll share it back with you. And please, if you have any feedback about me or about what AstraZeneca's doing for COPD or any kind of patients, we really want your feedback. And this is just the first time you've been contacted, but I'm sure there'll be other times, okay? Cause we're, we're really trying to hear from people about what's going on and all that kind of stuff. And I just, I think you're a lovely person and I'm glad you have your guys there and your puppy and all kinds of good things that you know you're at home, but at least you have people coming in, right."
Right. Do you use oxygen or have you been to pulmonary  ?
"Hello everyone, this is Gwen Carlton training lead respiratory immunology. Today I'm interviewing a very special guest whose name is Stephanie. Stephanie has COPD and she has agreed to share her patient journey with us today. Stephanie, would you like to tell the listeners a little bit about yourself?"
"Well, Stephanie, you have such a nice story about how you're able to solve problems. I'm very impressed by that. You're very articulate and intelligent and I appreciate you sharing your story, because at AstraZenca our goal is to put the patient first and we are trying to put the patient at the center of everything we do. And since we're working on treatments for COPD, your story can help not only motivate us, but also, so that we can have empathy with the people that we treat and you have a great story and I know it's not all, hadn't been all easy for you. I hear your pain, but thank you so much. I really believe this will help us."
So could you tell me what it feels like to you to have COPD?
Sorry. So tell me what symptoms you have with your COPD and about how often you have symptoms?
"Well, we were just talking about symptoms and how often, so any other at night, do you have symptoms?"
"So have you ever had a, what some people would call really extreme, increased symptoms or a COPD attack?"
So you said you'd been to the hospital and that was when you were having problems. Could you tell me about that experience being in the hospital?
Have you ever had to go to the emergency room for your COPD?
Do you take daily medicines for your COPD?
So do you have side effects to these medicines that you're on?
"So they help you, but they have problems at the same time. It sounds like-"
So can you tell me what limitations you have to everyday life and activities due to the fear of having a severe exacerbation or attack?
Right. I hear that loud and clear. So do you feel that there's a lack of treatment options for your COPD?
"It's OK. Wait, like I said, after five o'clock I hope not to keep you that long, but, okay. Do you feel that there are a lack of treatment options for COPD patients?"
"Right. Well, do you have any other conditions that impact your COPD?"
"Well, boys need their mama, I know that. Some girls can do without their mama, but not the dads, they need their mama."
"Well, I think that we've finished the interview. Is there anything that I've missed that you might want to say to my colleagues at AstraZeneca about what you do know about what's COPD is like? I did leave that question out."
"Yeah, I can understand that. Like you said, you have your leash."
"You do have portable oxygen sometimes, so you can go out sometimes. Is that right?"
"That's so kind, Pete. So would you like to just talk a little bit about your journey as a COPD patient? What type of symptoms you noticed at first or anything like that?"
"Do you have any other conditions, medical conditions, besides COPD or anything that makes your COPD better or worse?"
Right. But that doesn't sound like those are really related to your COPD maybe just that you're not moving around as much.
"Well, you are so kind and I appreciate it. It's just important for our colleagues at Astrazeneca to know the patient's so that they can discuss that with physicians. We at Astrazeneca are really trying to get in tune with the patient."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And yeah, thank you. Thank you so much again. Because, as you say, the whole purpose of this is to help others in your situation and especially those who have maybe just got the diagnosis, and less aware, less informed. So, how are you? I know you said there's a bit of an illness going around your house, but how are you feeling at the moment? How is your heart failure, any other conditions? How are you doing?"
"Well, they don't tell me anything. The technician's not allowed to say anything to me about... Because it's like, I have to go through the doctor. The doctor will see it, the test, and then I'll find out from the test ."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, it's been a long one. About 13 years ago, all of a sudden, I developed very severe symptoms of not being able to breathe after walking just a couple of steps and then for being very tired. Again, very classic symptoms of COPD. Although, I didn't know it at the time. And even if I was sitting down, I was not breathing properly so it was rather scary at first and I ended up going to my GP about it, who referred me to a specialist."
"Yeah. Well again, what COPD does, is it has changed, has affected my life. It's made my world smaller. It's not easy to get out and about. And it's also, had to rely on cleaners to do housework and again while we had COVID I couldn't have a cleaner, so the place got extremely messy. And as a result, I think I've picked up a bug, not that one, because it is a lack of cleanliness, so I'm, it's my personal care has deteriorated, I can't have a shower."
"I don't know how other people's communication with their doctors are, but I think there needs to be a very easy way for people to communicate with their doctors, especially in the beginning. It's hard enough to get in to see a doctor. So having something like a portal where I can email and he can email me back when he has time or his nurse can say, okay, I'm going to get this to him. He'll let you know."" That's super important. So easy communication with your care teams. And have a good pharmacist that you trust, that will tell you, ""No, that pill and that pill aren't going to play well together."" Or, ""Watch out for this symptom because of this measure on."" Don't get your meds at Walmart. Get them at somebody where you actually have a relationship with that doctor or that pharmacist. Because, I've had them go like, ""Yeah, you need to talk to your doctor. We'll call up there because this med's not going to play well with this meds you take."" Because, you don't need to be messed up because of that. So I guess that's it."

"Oh, sure, absolutely. I'm a full-time GP working in a suburban practice covering 15,000 patients, and I'm the COPD and the asthma lead in the practice, and also the clinical lead in the practice. Sorry, yeah."
"For the practice, the main GP equivalent. Obviously I sort of hopefully tend to guide them on what should or shouldn't be prescribed."
"Yeah, yeah, but because I focus mainly on COPD and asthma, it's not so bad. I've been doing it for 20 years, so it does help a bit sometimes,   00:03:33 ."
"Oh, we have quite a large population because the area we cover is sort of ... It's got high demand and a lot of smokers, so I'd say on an average month, I would see roughly between 60 and 80 COPDS patients."
"I personally think it should fit in really quite early. That's what I tend to do. I try not to wait for an exacerbation, but if I get a single exacerbation, because I know that's associated with increased mortality, even a single exacerbation, especially if they're smokers, I tend to switch them on very quickly to triple therapy. It's been proven benefit, with both Trelegy and Trimbow, especially with Trimbow."
"I would say up to as high as 30%, to be precise. Sorry, because I keep changing it. Yeah."
"Well, obviously I look at the underlying risk factors, because if they continue to smoke, I consider that, they're at very high risk of another exacerbation of COPD. If they have one single exacerbation, even though they're not admitted to hospital, and they're assessed by me, I tend to obviously ... I tend to put them on triple therapy. Can you just hold on for one second?"
"On your screen, because my screen is not on. Give me one minute log back in, okay?"
"You're probably right. I'm just trying to log back in. One second. Your name ... Yeah. Are you still there? Yeah, no, because   00:06:38 ."
" inaudible 00:06:43 . Hold on. It should be logging me back in. Yeah, I'm back in. Yeah, yeah."
"Actually, to be fair, actually we had a meeting ... Well, obviously online meeting, with the, to see a rep from Trimbow."
"That was interesting, because it's the one three-in-one combination that have a license for maintenance treatment of both advanced COPD and adult asthma, so, which I thought was quite interesting, because of the   00:07:57 ."
"COPD. The consultant had given us a talk on COPD management, actually, so, it was only about two weeks ago. "
"It was sponsored by Chiesi, who is obviously doing Trimbow, as a promotional product, which I found quite interesting because I was using it anyway."
"Yeah, because I mean, I think Trimbow has come up with three different studies, I think, TRILOGY, TRINITY, and TRIBUTE,  inaudible 00:08:42 . They were suggesting that even a single exacerbation increases mortality, so we have to ... Trimbow shows superiority as far as P-values are concerned, in the TRILOGY study, compared to an ICS/LABA, for example. Obviously, it also shows, the TRIBUTE study showed superiority compared to a LABA/LAMA combination with statistical significance, especially with the SGRQ scores, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire scores, and also more importantly, the aim is to reduce exacerbations, so to prevent hospital admissions. I think that's where the key point is, and I think that's why I'm very keen on getting people as quickly as possible."
"I think I am, to be honest, but I like to keep updated studies, and obviously the drug reps, even though it's virtual meetings most of the time."
"Yes, second most emergency admissions  inaudible 00:11:31 . Okay. 50% undiagnosed. 40%, readmission. Yeah. That's very interesting, yeah. Okay,  inaudible 00:11:51 ."
"My thoughts are that ... It is that what worries me the most is that readmission rate of 40% in 90 days. It's a severe exacerbation. Obviously, and the prevalence. I assume   00:12:12 ."
Yeah. What I'm concerned about is the prevalence.
"Yeah. That's the thing. I wasn't aware of that. I knew it was high, but I wasn't aware it was as high as 40%. That is a very interesting fact to note."
"I know that, well, the UK government spends at least 800 million pounds a year on respiratory diseases, so, which the majority is COPD. That's a fact. That's what I was made aware, at the meeting."
"Yes, about the number of people being affected. The undiagnosed is the other thing which I wasn't  inaudible 00:13:11 , because I didn't expect 50%. I thought it was like 30% undiagnosed, according to the meeting, but I guess it depends. We were talking about our local area in Kent as opposed to the whole of the United Kingdom."
"Well, that is quite a scary thought, because I'm not sure it's because ...  inaudible 00:13:55 , it's because of the pandemic, that people have not been turning up to see us, which is a known fact in the last 12 to 18 months. That could explain the high figure, but that is really, really high. I didn't expect it to be that high."
"I think we have to do more active screening for people who are short of breath, and don't assume-"
"I think you also have to explain to people who smoke, which is one of the biggest risk factors for COPD mortality and diagnosis, is that they really have to stop smoking. Smoking cessation is essentially. Lifestyle advice is essential, and I think education is extremely important in this case, in my personal opinion. I think this slide is extremely useful, because it tells us that ... If I'm missing 50%, I'm really quite concerned. Why is it such a high figure? I thought it was about 20 to 30%."
"Well, yeah. This is a fascinating slide, to be honest, because it's a worldwide representation of COPD, and COPD related deaths, and it shows that it's quite high in certain areas compared to other areas, as far as prevalence is concerned and deaths from COPD. It's quite striking that some are in developed countries like United States of America, and, which is quite interesting. South America, obviously, Africa. The UK is highlighted as quite a high rate, which is also quite surprising, which I think I didn't expect that, to be honest. I thought we were much better than that, in picking up and diagnosing COPD, so it's quite a scary slide, to be honest."
Exposure to environmental factors is important.
"I think the main point is to try and reduce the number of deaths from COPD. Once you're aware how high it is, I think that's the main point, and obviously to be aware of pollution, environmental risk factors, not just smoking. Everything else."
"No. I think, no, it's quite a comprehensive slide, and it talks about  inaudible 00:17:59 ."
"Okay. Yeah, this is interesting because ... Again, I never expected that a quarter of COPD exacerbations are not even reported. I'm not sure, you mean hospital reporting, or primary care reporting?"
"Yeah, because honestly once they're admitted to hospital, it's documented and I know it. We tend to document every single exacerbation of COPD, at least I tend to do that, because I'd want them to have-"
"Yeah, didn't expect as high as that. I was hoping that it'd be reported more frequently, but also just, I'm not sure. Are these UPLIFT studies and ECLIPSE studies, are they, or just ECLIPSE data?"
"Well, that is really, really scary, because again, we're not actually ... I think it's good to know these percentages, because we should educate the patients when they're first being diagnosed. Then in the next three years, they have a 77% increased risk of getting COPD, based on statistics, exacerbation, and if they smoke they should stop smoking. If they're overweight, lose weight. You see, and obviously mental health is important, and socioeconomic status is extremely important, so I think all these are contributing factors. BMI is extremely important, because I've seen elderly patients who obviously don't have the effort to breathe because their BMI is on the low side of normal, and obviously we encourage nutrition and we give them supplements to build them up. I think that's-"
"Yeah, the main message is to impart knowledge to patients. This is an educational slide for patients and for doctors, to impart to patients that COPD must be taken seriously."
"It resonates, but not as high as 77%. Maybe I'm slightly proactive and hit them hard earlier on the triple inhalers, or refer them early for pulmonary rehab if their MRC score is greater than three or more. I think that's part and parcel of the whole management of COPD."
"Oh, well, it's extremely relevant, because it's showing ... I like it because it's showing the flow chart from COPD to reduced lung function."
"Yeah, so it's extremely useful, and you can see how they're all interlinked. Physical activity, et cetera, and the quality of life here. All these are extremely important for their mental health, if nothing else."
"A seven. I don't know who is doing these slides, but they're doing an exceptionally good presentation."
"Yeah, I'm not familiar with the WISDOM study, but I'm aware of the exacerbation ... Eight exacerbations and you lose function. That I was aware, again, but ... It was quite interesting that, I'm assuming that   00:23:45 -"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. The WISDOM study is suggesting that  inaudible 00:23:51  loss of lung function, which I think is quite ..."
"Yeah, the WISDOM study, yeah. This is where, an arrow points here. This drop, they do recover, but they still have lost that  inaudible 00:24:14  of function. What's interesting is, which I've been reading about, mild and moderate, there's a certain slope ..."
"Yeah. It's that slope, which an arrow is pointing to. The slope is really steep when it's mild, you see, and I think-"
"Yeah, and this fits in with my observation. It's the mild thing we've got to be very focused on. That's where we can see the biggest improvement in lung function and quality of life, and reduction in exacerbations. That's why I say, if you have a mild ... If they have mild COPD and they have a single attack, single exacerbation, and quite aggressive management, and the NICE guidelines do advise LAMA/LABA as a first line, but I usually monitor them in three months, and if they have an exacerbation in that three months, I go straight to fixed dose triple, to be honest."
"I think that's a very impactful slide, because it shows the decline. I think the most important thing is the decline, and the exacerbation. There are two important things on the slide."
"On the right-hand side, it's the slope, yeah. Yeah, and this is the   00:25:31 -"
"The main message is that even though they have mild COPD, they should be treated aggressively."
"Hold on. Hold on. Hold on, can you hear me now?"
"Okay, so I'll put you on speaker, I'm afraid. I'm in the library."
"Okay, 20%. I was aware of that figure around 20%, yeah. To moderate, eight percent. No, I wasn't aware of that, within one year. Okay. That's a new thing. Yeah. I guess I'll have a look at this."
"Yeah. I'm looking at this. That's statistically significant, P-values. I like that. You can see  inaudible 00:27:17 ."
It's essential you have to treat everybody with a single exacerbation this aggressively.
You have to treat a single exacerbation aggressively.
Which of the arrows ... This one is surprising.
"Yeah, that's also very important, I guess you're right. Yeah."
"No, I've heard of that, in the talk. I've heard of that, in the talk."
"This is new to me. I haven't come across this before. I mean, I was aware of it, but not the actual figures."
"It's this bit here, which I've circled, and this bit here."
Yeah. It just highlights to look at other risk factors when they present with COPD.
That's a good question. I think the CV events after the first 10 days.
"Okay. Well, that's a fascinating slide.  inaudible 00:33:34  combination of risk factors for COPD and ischemic heart disease, 40 ... Up to 40%, that's really high, and COPD and AS."
You have to assess the risk factors of ischemic heart disease.
"Well, you have to be aware of the risk factors of ischemic heart disease."
"No, it's not new, but I wasn't aware of the percentage.  inaudible 00:34:23  percentage of risk."
"That's hard to say, because we have personal relationships. We tend to know our patients better."
Yeah. I was quite aware of this because of cor pulmonale.
"Yeah, because of cor pulmonale, COPD and heart failure."
"Yeah. It obviously depends on the stage. Yeah, definitely makes sense because of the rapid decline, after initially shown, with moderate as opposed to severe. This graph shows there's a rapid decline in the slope of the graph with moderate. Severe tends to flatten out,  inaudible 00:37:07 . I think there's not much reserve in lung function left, so the decline is not significant. The moderate   00:37:16  can decline."
"Yeah, chart I. I'm looking at   00:37:31 -"
"Yeah. That, I'm aware of. I'm not aware of the other one, the lung cancer, respiratory, rate of deaths."
"Well, no, that doesn't surprise me because we know cor pulmonale, which is right heart failure associated with COPD, is a quite common cause of death, because obviously the lungs affect the heart."
"Oh yeah. Unfortunately very commonly, with the moderate to severe COPD patients."
"Not ... The actual numbers, yes. It's almost double. That's a surprise. I knew there was an increased risk at moderate, and I think that's the emphasis of treating aggressively for mild to moderate. To me, that's important."
"I think the  inaudible 00:39:48  is quite good, because the exacerbation causes  inaudible 00:39:52 , hypoxemia, and tachycardia."
"No, I'm fully away of the pathophysiology of heart failure secondary to COPD, so that would fit with my findings."
"We know that  inaudible 00:41:02  of disease, so  inaudible 00:41:05 , that  inaudible 00:41:07  combination. I call it  inaudible 00:41:10  disease, asthma and COPD. That's why we routinely check their eosinophil counts, to see if it's raised, so that they don't have coexisting asthma. If they had more than 500   00:41:25 -"
"Hold on. Patient  inaudible 00:41:43 . Yes. I think, because there's always ... In some patients, there's an asthmatic component associated with COPD, and I think you have to treat-"
"All of them, because we tend to do a baseline blood test on all our patients, so we check their full blood counts, and that's picks up eosinophils."
"No, it's a graph representation, which is exactly very similar to this, to be honest. It shows that once they get one exacerbation, the frequency of future exacerbation increases quite closely. As you can see, between two three, and three and four, and five and six, and six and seven, are really quite close together."
"Yeah, yeah. Changing representation would be useful."
Changing the representation would be useful.
"Yeah. There is ... Yeah. I think that's true, but I'm never quite sure of the timeframe of the second exacerbation and the third. I'm never quite sure on that."
"Relevance, again, it would still be seven."
"Okay, that's quite an interesting one, because they're using the MRC scores."
"Yeah, so it shows that as the MRC scores increases, the risk of exacerbation obviously does increase, but not exactly doubling, but increases gradually."
"I've never seen as high as that, but I'm sure that is correct, because I just treat them aggressively initially, with triple fixed dose therapy."
"Again, I would say it's, because of the one in two figure, I'll say seven in all."
"Yeah. I think that's why the triple therapy came out, because ICS has been shown as an add-on to reduce the exacerbation rates in patients with COPD, regardless of the eosinophil level. Even in a COPD patient I see has a normal eosinophil level, I wouldn't think twice of adding a triple inhaler, because I know that there is benefit in reducing exacerbations, which reduces mortality."
I think it's one of the most important slides.
"People usually associate ICS with asthma only, and not know that there is a role. I know Trimbow has got license for chronic adult asthma, so there is a role of keeping the eosinophil count low, if possible, to reduce the exacerbations."
"Yeah, it's shown a quite significant reduction in exacerbations."
"Yeah, I start off with a LAMA, usually, and then I go to a LAMA/LABA, depending on the obviously FEV1, because if the FEV1 is less than 50% I go straight to a LAMA/LABA combination. Then in three months' time, I tend to usually go to a fixed dose combination to prevent an exacerbation in the first instance."
"No, I wouldn't. I think this is quite a good slide, to be honest."
"I think it's early diagnosis and a combination of using the multidisciplinary team, because 22% have not been sufficient to reduce exacerbations. Yeah. 42%, pulmonary rehab. I think that's useful. Reduction in mortality, and 30% obviously, triple therapy. Again, you've got significant P-values, less than 0.05."
"Yeah, moderate to severe, exacerbation, 30%, for triple therapy, versus ... I was aware it was more effective than LAMA/LABA combinations, so triple therapy is the way forward, to be honest."
"Yeah, I think the overall message should be that we should be quite proactive and look at comorbidities, because of increased risk of CV deaths that you should be aware of, but also explain to the patient the higher risk of CV deaths, especially in the first 10 days, and obviously, and the persistence of the risk. I think it's very important, and obviously smoking cessation, pulmonary rehab, and pharmacological intervention. Aggressive pharmacology is especially, even if they have a single exacerbation, even though they're mild COPD, I think we have to be proactive, to be honest."
"Yeah, I think it's going good because you're  inaudible 00:53:15  qualitative and quantitative, giving actual figures, which I think is important because people understand numbers better than words, generally speaking. If you tell them that you can reduce their risk by half or reduce the risk by 22% if you stop smoking, from preventing exacerbation, I think, or 30%, if you're on triple therapy, reduce the risk of hospital admission, I think that's extremely important."
"Well, I think the major challenge is education and understanding."
"Yeah. I think the doctors also have to ... If the doctor's aware of the knowledge and the percentages, they can educate, make the patient aware of the absolute risk, or relative risk, in this case, based on these studies."
Yeah. You'll have to hold on for two second because I have to re-log on.
"They only give you one hour on this computer, so I'm logging on."
"From home, it's quite tricky sometimes. It's my day off today, so, okay."
"No, no, not yet. I'm just logging in, so, in a different name. Hold on for a second. Give me two seconds, Angelina. Yeah?"
"Yeah, it says enter room. I just clicked on it."
"Yeah, hold on. No, it just ... Yeah, I've just typed my name in. Otherwise it won't let me in."
"Yes, it's loading. It's quite quick, actually, compared to mine. Yeah, got it. Got it, yeah."
"Okay, some interesting data because you've got numbers needed to treat, which I like."
"Okay, hold on. LAMA/LABA. Exacerbations are less, 1.42. Got it. Okay. 1.08. I see, it's 1.24, that's 30%, 24%. Okay."
"What's fascinating with V here is obviously, it's less for the ICS, and LAMA/LABA. Okay. Yeah, fire away. Yeah."
"Okay, so CV total, you're looking at, Product X is 11%, 28, okay, to 11%. On treatment, this is post-treatment, yeah? This is, yeah, post-treatment. I'm not sure ... What do the brackets mean, 0.5? Do you know what 0.5 means? I don't understand."
"Okay, so the percentage is in brackets, yeah?"
"Okay, so 0.5%, 1.3%, and 0.5%, yeah. The death rate is, okay. That's fascinating, too. Yeah, good."
Y. Okay.  inaudible 01:02:56  exacerbations on the Y axis. Okay. 48%.
"Moderate, again, moderate to severe. Oh, this is on eosinophils. Yeah."
"Well, I think it's ... I'm not sure if it's compared to other ... What I do like is the numbers needed to treat. It's three and seven, which is quite good. The lower the number needed to treat, the better the outcomes."
"It's also got significant confidence intervals, which is away from zero, so I think that's ... The P-values are interesting, because with LAMA/LABA, the P-values are significant, but not with ICS/LABA, on slide Y. I'm not sure how statistically significant that is."
"I think it fits extremely well together, because it all shows that triple therapy does work for COPD patients, irrespective of the eosinophil status, and does reduce the exacerbation rate, which is a key, and correlated with mortality, and also shown that it does reduce the risk of CV deaths, with is comorbidities, because we know at least 20 or 30% or more die of heart failure, or even higher if you've got severe COPD."
"I think patients definitely with moderate COPD, as opposed to severe, because you want to hit them hard as soon as they're diagnosed, because they say up to 50% of patients on presentation are diagnosed with moderate COPD as opposed to mild COPD, which is less than 20 to 30%. We tend to miss that mild COPD, both because they present late, and I think most ... Since half the patients present with, at least from what I've read, half the patients present with moderate COPD, I think I would be starting with the drug very quickly after LAMA/LABA combination. They're at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity, because we know that ischemic heart disease, stroke, COPD, lung cancer is recorded as six and diabetes as nine. We want to prevent comorbidity deaths, so I think on my end, I'll be getting quite aggressive with my treatment, to be honest, but again, focus a lot on education with all the facts you've given me, because I think it's really quite important, too. Current 40% readmission rate in 90 days, I think that's a very important fact."
"No, it's my first line in moderate patients according to the NICE guidelines."
"F, it's 100% yes, because even a single exacerbation can increase mortality or future hospital admissions."
"H, it's a very complicated slide and I don't think many people will be ..."
"I, yes, because it shows moderate is more important than severe, initial management."
Because most people understand the pathophysiology of COPD leading to cardiovascular events.
"K, yes, definitely, yes, because people should give  inaudible 01:10:34  if someone has a high exacerbation risk."
"M, no, because ... That increased symptoms are associated with increased risk of exacerbations anyway, by definition."
"Because we know, by definition, exacerbation is an increase of prolonged, sustained symptoms, which increase sputum production, increase breathlessness, and increase cough. We know what an exacerbation is, and we know that it's important to know the findings behind the single exacerbation can increase mortality and death, and other comorbidities. That's important."
"Definitely yes, yeah, because it shows that just because the eosinophil count is normal doesn't mean they should not have triple therapy."
"Actually, I would ... Go forward, forward, forward. Forward. That's important. G, G, G, G."
"Yeah, that's, D. D is the most important, the most important. No, D, D."
"Yeah, D, yeah, because it shows the rapid decline in mild COPD."
"Yeah, I think it should people aware that even if they have mild COPD, that should be closely monitored, because if their lung function declines, they're a risk of exacerbation. It's as simple as that, and they need to be on triple therapy as soon as possible. As soon as convenient."
"Well, I would put another column next to it, mortality."
"The risk of mortality over the next three years, would be my third column, on the right-hand graph."
"Well, I would advise them to actually go and get a good device, because I think device is as important as the drug itself, because  inaudible 01:14:30  the efficacy of a device, or the ease of use of a device is extremely important. I've seen patients not using  inaudible 01:14:39 . When I've switched them from a LAMA/LABA to a triple therapy, I try and stick to the same device if I can."
"Well, I hope they come out with a drug soon, because GSK and Chiesi have. Yeah, okay, thank you so much."
"Yep. I'm a full-time doctor working as a GP. Particular areas of interest would be diabetes, respiratory and palliative medicine. Work as a single... Sorry, it's not single at all. We're a partnership of doctors. I've been there the longest, senior partner in an area in southeast of the UK, which has quite a relatively high level of deprivation, considering the area we live in with lots of chronic disease, unemployment, and mental health issues."
"Actually seeing, I think we have to talk about pre-COVID and post-COVID really because obviously a lot of consultations, which we're doing, are now going to be done remotely either by telephone or video. But counting those, I would say probably I manage quite a few, but actually seeing or discussing with patients, probably around about 30 every month, 30 to 40."
"So there's a good range of severity really. I think the majority will be in the mild, moderate, probably the order of about 60% in the mild and moderate group and perhaps 40% in the severe, very severe. Maybe 35%/65%, probably split that way. Probably the one seeing the most would be the more severe cases, so it would be the moderate to severe would be the ones I'm seeing most."
"Yeah. So most of them are going to be over the age of 50. The majority of them have been lifelong smokers, which has led to the disease. There is a few younger, rarer types, but the majority would be, I think, a good mix of male and female actually. So smokers and often have a lot of comorbidities. They have diabetes or other smoking-related diseases, ischemic heart disease. Some people have asthma or have both conditions, and maybe relatively lower class often, as a demographic I would say. That's more men than women."
"On triple therapy, so that's either combined or on one inhaler or several inhalers. I would say-"
"It's not something that I tend to start with, unless we've picked up a patient who is just presented very, very late in terms of the severity of their disease. So the majority of those patients are going to be those who are in the moderate to severe category, who may have progressed through other preventive therapies, LAMA/LABA, or LAMA on its own, and not be particularly controlled symptomatically. So there's going to be patients, who perhaps, have continued smoking, who have had increased numbers of exacerbations and where their disease has progressed and they've become more symptomatic and more severe on a spirometry."
"How does an escalation occur? So it happens in usually one of two main ways. Firstly, the patient's annual review, and that is routinely offered to all patients with COPD, a yearly check so we can get objective evidence through the spirometry on how their lung capacity has changed. Look back at what the year's been like for them, talking about symptoms. That's often done by one of our practice nurses and then discussion with me if we need to change the treatment."
"But the other way would be almost on an ad hoc. You have a patient who's come in, you look back, and they've had perhaps three or four recent consultations or exacerbations, which they've had treatment. Then you talk about interval symptoms and realize that they're not actually improving. Those would be the two ways more acute and then the general annual review."
"Usually, in terms of exacerbations, they're usually there or thereabout from those because often we're issuing them with rescue kits. If they don't know, it's very easy to look very quickly back at the computer and see how often they've been in or perhaps seen members of the other team. But in terms of remembering their symptoms, generally they're pretty good. Sometimes with breathlessness, they don't necessarily always appreciate things have gotten worse if it's been a very gradual deterioration, but generally as a rule of thumb, people know when they're able to do less. I'll ask them, ""What could you do a year ago that you can't do now?"" It's often quite a telling question."
"Before it's escalation, I think it would probably be at least two exacerbations in a year. I think also, just seeing what their interval symptoms are and getting them to come back for reviews in four to six weeks after exacerbation just to see how they are and make that assessment with them. If they're fine, if they're completely back to normal, then usually there's no particular reason to increase their treatment. But if there are subjectively or if you've got any objective evidence that they're actually beginning to, they've never quite got back to their baseline, then that would certainly be a key indicator to step up treatment to triple therapy."
"So you're looking at the patient in front of you, looking at their age, demographic, if they smoke, what their other comorbidities are, and already formulating the possibilities of what breathlessness might be due to. So you ask them a few questions to try and to narrow it down. You want to ask them about wheezing and cough, ask them about fatigue and bruising in case it's just an anemic-based thing or a blood disorder. Ask them about shortness of breath at night, ankle swelling in case you're thinking heart failure."
"You're trying to target various common causes through your history, and then that's backed up by your examination findings. So you're trying to then work out... If from that it's fairly obvious, then you can then take patients down the pathway, be that heart failure, be that asthma, but often you're going to be looking at doing some other investigations at that point: blood tests looking for anemia, heart failure with the BNP, thinking about chest X-ray, doing a simple bedside test like a peak flow in the surgery, doing a spirometry if they're a smoker and you're suspecting that they've got COPD. So your history, your examination, then starting to narrow it down further to diagnose it throughout the investigation."
"Yes. So at that point, getting to this stage, certainly in our practice, a whole variety of practitioners who will all be possibly the initial assessors. That could be a prescribing nurse practitioner, a prescribing paramedic practitioner that we've got in house. That could be the practice nurse who's picked somebody up as well in a sort of a by the way, in a consultation. So they're going to be coming from a variety of services. They'll then usually discuss things with the physician themselves or my colleagues if they're unsure about the way to proceed or book them in if it's not immediately obvious, but they may start an investigation process as well, getting things done like ECGs and blood tests. They often do the workup and then patients can come in and see us after that's all been done to work out the way forward."
"So I think the key indicators would be a very clear history of wheezing and cough in a smoker with the absence of chest pain. We've got orthopnea. I don't know if you're familiar with that term. It's basically breathlessness when you lay flat. So that's a very typical symptom of heart failure. So if you've got those more chest related symptoms and clinical examination support that you can hear some wheezing, then I'm not going to do unnecessary testing on what I don't think it's relevant."
"Cardiovascular disease, then next steps for that would be usually to do an ECG and blood tests, particularly focusing more on the risk factors, things like ruling out diabetes, HbA1c, checking a fasting cholesterol, looking for various things that would contribute to that, asking about family history, checking their blood pressure, smoking status, and beginning to work up that side of things as well because often the two things can coexist. So you may be doing tests potentially down both avenues at the same time."
"So if they do have COPD, then usually it's at that point it would be a case of looking at the spirometry results. Obviously during the lockdown time, we weren't able to do that so often. It was really a case of trying to work out which we thought clinically would be the best inhaler for the patient, but usually starting them on either a LAMA or perhaps more commonly now on LABA/LAMA combination and giving them a short acting one as well. If it's just mild symptoms, may start with short acting  inaudible 00:15:43 . But we're starting with a LABA/LAMA."
"I would say about 95%. They're often smokers. So they may carry with them ischemic heart disease. Well, cardiovascular disease will start often, may have diabetes, CKD, and things like depression often go hand in hand COPD as well, just because it's two things really too. I'd say it's a very, very common, and bearing in mind most of them are going to be over the age of 50 plus anyway, and that age brings with it other conditions."
Most concerning would be things which there's more serious in nature. So certainly things like cancer. So particularly if you got-
"Yeah. So I think ischemic heart disease, number one, and then things like diabetes and CKD and depression. I'm thinking that vascular disease as well, if not lumping that into cardiovascular disease."
"To be honest, all of them. I think if you've got ischemic heart disease, then certainly start the ball rolling with that. And if they get significant chest pain, then often would share care by referring them to secondary care for a cardiology assessment. For diabetes, I'm very comfortable managing that. Early stage CKD, depression, comfortable managing all that. So I think it depends on the severity and the acuteness of the other condition really, but in the majority, if they're well controlled or being monitored would be quite comfortably done in primary care, unless they feel there's an intervention that secondary care can offer to improve the patient's quality of life."
"Yeah, we tend to. Often they're smokers, often they're elderly. And so, often as part of the workup, particularly if they're breathless, then I would be doing cholesterol and HbA1c and certainly having a discussion with them about smoking and the benefits of giving that up, not only for their lungs but also for their heart as well. I think it's a very important thing. Don't always concentrate on it. Depends on what else is going on in the consultation, but certainly try to knowing that not being focused, it's going to be a high risk, particularly if they're hypertensive as well."
"No, I don't think it does actually. I don't think that would make any difference to the management knowing that they have ischemic heart disease, for instance. Can't think of any contraindications for stepping up treatment. So no, it wouldn't make me do it any quicker. I think I'd still rely on symptoms of the COPD."
"No CV risk factors we're talking about, like high cholesterol, IV hypertension. I would reckon probably about 40, 50, yeah 40%, probably just under half. It's quite high."
"Probably around about one in four, one in three, somewhere around 30%."
"Yes. We often try to do it at the same time. So if someone's coming in for an annual review, say ischemic heart disease, but I think if it's diabetes, then often they get managed separately because they're both quite time consuming annual reviews. So they often don't. It's quite a long session for the clinician and the patient. So yes, it will be managed but not necessarily at the same time."
"Smoking is the number one. And secondly, I would say hypertension. Thirdly, probably raised cholesterol. Fourthly, diabetes."
"I think what the main things would be their symptoms. So specifically thinking about the sort of patients I've referred to cardiology, it would be fairly nuanced or worsening of symptoms consistent with angina where cardiology intervention would be perhaps expected or question on what basis somebody who would benefit from angiography or even bypass. Anyone who's got valvular heart disease where we want to know if that's contributing to their breathlessness, whether that would be, again, treatable surgically, and anyone with atrial fibrillation, which again might be contributing to their symptoms that may warrant ablation or cardioversion."
So I guess it's going to be those patients where a specific intervention by the cardiologist is thought will either want their opinion on or might be helpful for the patient in terms of managing the risk factors. Very rarely would I involve secondary care possibly for people with difficult and high cholesterol using a biochemistry consultant rather than a cardiologist.
"Well, certainly it's partly guided by patient's perspective on what they feel is the most worrying cause of their symptoms. You listen to them and see what they feel. Often it's worried about chest tightness and exertion. So that may lead you to think, sounds more cardiovascular than respiratory as a cause of their breathlessness. And so you're very much focused on what the history is from the patient in front of you, so what you feel is the most likely cause of their either deterioration or change in symptoms."
"They do sometimes. I think recently often you have patients who come in, and you may not necessarily be quite sure as to whether their breathlessness is due to cardiac causes or it's respiratory. Often, they may have comorbidities. So in that situation, you may refer for an echocardiogram. The cardiologist does that and does the necessary testing to then write back to you and say, ""Actually cardiac-wise, we are all pretty good here. We don't think this is contributing. Maybe a respiratory cause."" Majority of the time, we would know about that or have suspected it, but just occasionally the patient may go to a cardiologist first off, and then you actually think, well, probably do need a respiratory opinion. But again, often we would do spirometry in house. We usually have a cardiologist often just say, refer to a specialist, but actually the patient may not need that. There may be a lot that we can do in primary care before that step."
"Not anymore. I think 10 years ago that may well have happened. The consultants then refers, but currently that doesn't happen at all. They're very much tunnel vision specialists nowadays, and they may suggest something like that. But they don't step outside of their comfort zone, and they don't start initiating other tests with the loss of the general physician really. No, that never happens."
"It comes back to primary care, absolutely. Yeah."
"That a good question actually. I've always thought of them as being quite separate diseases but maybe with common risk factors, particularly smoking, but I've never thought of them as being a continuum. Now you've mentioned it, maybe think about smoking damage to the-"
"So maybe you can look at it as like an inflammatory condition. I know there're some theories about ischemic heart disease, cardiovascular disease being inflammatory in nature, and the inflammatory nature of lungs. Maybe you could think of it as a continuum, but I haven't really thought of it until today, I have to say."
"It's possible, I suppose, because with declining lung function, it may be putting pressure on the myocardium. So I see that could be possible. Probably need someone more scientific and physiology based to explain that to me, but I could see that potentially the conditions could be interrelated, I suppose. Similarly, if you've got a poorly performing heart, that could potentially put, I suppose, pressure on the lungs, which may contribute. But I don't know, not something I'm aware of."
"Yeah, okay. So all in all, it doesn't surprise me that such a high number of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular causes. Interestingly, I would say looking at the figures, it's probably a lot higher. The cancer causes, looking at the numbers, which is this spot... But no, it doesn't surprise me that there would be cardiac-related death knowing that patients who die of COPD are often the more severe often ones that have been chronic smokers all their life. So I would expect them to have significant cardiovascular disease as well. So yeah, I mean seeing that doesn't surprise me just because of the fact that people often very commonly have those comorbidities."
"Okay, yeah. So initial statement suggests that, again, patients with COPD, higher risk of cardiovascular disease than those that aren't, which again, does not surprise because they're smokers often, almost always. Yeah, that in some ways is not unexpected."
"No, nothing to suggest a connection there."
"Yeah. So I suppose that is what... I might have heard something before about that, but it certainly does suggest that you've got a significant risk following exacerbation of COPD and of MI and stroke, more so heart attack. Stroke seems to be increased later down the line a few days later. But yeah, that does suggest that there may be some link to what's happening in the lungs affecting cardiovascular disease. If you are getting these high rates following, especially with an MI, that suggests something potentially going on which is increasing that risk, whether that's down to illness putting strain on the heart or reducing myocardial perfusion as a result of patients being unwell. Yeah, clearly is some link there being suggested."
"I can't, no. It's certainly something which is big recall from the distant vestiges of my brain about the risks of some having heart attack or death after an exacerbation of COPD hospitalization. It does seem to ring bells or something that I have come across before. I can't remember where though. Probably one of these GP updates, I suspect."
"It would do because I think what you're aiming in knowing that your risk of MI is doubling. A stroke is doubling up, exacerbation, it makes you want to be a little bit more vigorous, I would think, in actually reducing exacerbations in the first place. So taking a step back from that might make you wish to be a bit more aggressive in how you treat mild and moderate patients with COPD, hitting them-"
"Stepping up earlier, yeah. Perhaps coming into using triple therapy. But I think we need to see some good evidence of that, that it makes a difference."
"There are downsides to using therapy with inhaled steroid treat. It could increase the risk of patients having pneumonia hospitalization. There is still that uncertainty about the place sometimes of inhaled steroid and whether it's cost efficient. They're very expensive, inhalers, and are we making a difference to our patients? There's got to be, as I say, good evidence that stepping up earlier is going to save lives."
"Okay, so certainly shows that we've got a big 49% reduction in mortality using triple therapy compared to a LABA/LAMA. So it does appear to significantly reduce mortality. It doesn't say which group of COPD patients it's treating. So is it the same for all moderate, minor, moderate, and severe?"
"Oh, moderate to very severe, okay. Well, that's helpful. Yeah. Well, that goes with what we do already. I guess it's going to be the moderate to very severe patients who are on triple therapy anyway. So it may be that this sort of information might encourage more clinicians to go to triple therapy earlier. Maybe people who are sitting on patients who are moderate, who are not complaining, particularly have actually some good evidence that this could make quite a difference to them.   00:40:05  is 80s. That's quite a lot to treat 80 patients presumably to get that one patient surviving."
"Yeah, okay. So not quite huge, not a huge difference, but the reduction in mortality looks more impressive."
"Just trying to think how that might be, what the mechanism would be for that really. The only difference is the inhaled steroid. So if that's in some way reducing inflammation, that's presumably only acting locally in the lung, although you're going to get some absorption into the body. Whether you're inside I don't know really because it shouldn't really be having much of an effect at all beyond where it's being inhaled. So yeah. And it's obviously cumulative because it's actually better than the ICS LABA, but it's not entirely down to... Maybe it's because we are reducing the amount of infection or exacerbation. So maybe it's the infection itself. Maybe it's that inflammation that you are getting with the infection that's the problem here. It's causing that inflammatory somehow being driven in cardiovascular."
"Yes, it does. It might make me review my next argument to use on LABA/LAMA and just think about stepping them up."
"Right. So certainly what you're saying is that it's the majority of the different product X is this triple therapy, which the only difference is it accounted for a reduction in cardiovascular causes producing to be quite significantly lower certainly than the LABA/LAMA, whereas the others are probably not statistically different. So presumably product X is having some stabilizing effect on cardiovascular disease, whether it's again, partly due to preventing escalation of the inflammatory response. That's the only reason I could think that it might be reducing it."
"How compelling? I think you're certainly seeing it quite a significant difference compared to LABA/LAMA, whether it statistically different from an ICS LABA. I'm looking at the figures. I'm not a statistician but I don't think that there necessarily is, but there certainly does seem to be some overall benefit to the inhaled steroid component in these inhalers. So patients who are not on those who are perhaps high cardiovascular risk may be a population that would benefit from being on this triple therapy if they're not already."
"It is, yeah, because I'm trying to think of... It's just rethinking of the mechanism, why they're doing so well on it. And maybe it's the severity of the... Obviously the last slide I think it was with the exacerbation rate was high causing MI and that's reduced too. Maybe it's something to that preventing infection and inflammation. This is inhaled treatment. It shouldn't really be accessing the body other than in very small amounts. So yeah, I don't understand fully why it's happening, and I knew that it would all be more complicated."
"Yeah, that's true. I think I am actually. I'm looking at the figures in front of me and the graph in front of me, thinking it's the product that seems to be making the difference. I've not really thought about it because I suppose what we haven't got is the evidence that there's any reduction in exacerbations from these slides or there's that there's any prevention in symptoms, which is probably why I'm not focused on the COPD because we haven't got any of that information there. But maybe that would be helpful."
"Be useful to have that information to see, I suppose. We as doctors would like to understand how something works, why it should make a difference. So I think if you've got that other information available in terms of is it reducing exacerbations to COPD, is it improving their COPD as well, then that information, I think, is quite important as well to help us understand what's going on here."
"Yeah, I think it's really very critical information, and whilst numbers need to treat maybe small, it's still very much potentially lifesaving treatment, which is always a good thing. Ultimately, our goal is probably mortality. Or is it that in some way, is it the LABA/LAMA that's actually... Is that somehow increasing cardiovascular death, and is the steroid component mitigating that? Let's have a question mark there. Is the treatment influencing it and actually causing more death? That's just another thought. It's not straightforward."
Absolute risk reduction.  silence 00:50:51 .
"Well, that's a really useful slide to see. It puts it in perspective, though that actually there is a significant reduction in risk mortality compared to other things that we're doing already. So that's a really helpful slide to see that comparison. So we know that SGLT-2 is at the moment the bee's knees, but actually when you see them in the context of that, actually it looks a little bit better, certainly with product X, and also significantly improved compared to the statins. So it helps put it into context in that slide, and looking at all other measures we are using at the moment to reduce cardiovascular risk, see what the benefits are. So that actually looks extremely and is very, I think, potentially influential slide to get the point known."
"Yeah, but I thought number to treat 80 was actually quite high, but actually when you puts it into context with what we're doing already, it's actually very good. So that's been quite a surprise and a revelation actually. Statin's been around such a long time now, you forget the fine detail of things like the SS trial, but yeah, so that's actually going to give us more protection than what we're currently doing."
"Well, I think when you're treating COPD, you tend to be a little bit heavy hearted. In some ways you know that patients are going to perhaps deteriorate, particularly if they're still smoking and that you haven't really got much in the way of positive options. Once you've gotten them onto inhalers, there's not really an awful lot more you can do to improve their lot. So I think this is quite a new way of thinking more positively about COPD patients, knowing that yes, we may not be able to necessarily achieve much more in terms of proven function of their lungs, but in terms of their overall comorbidity and death reduction, then actually we can achieve a little bit more now. So I think that's a real positive place to look at triple therapy."
"Well, I think if it's going to be part of what we're doing already, yeah, it's just another bit of information to hopefully encourage earlier prescribing to try and reduce a few patients who die prematurely. So I think it's really potentially very important information to get out there, supporting the use of triple therapy because there has been a bit of backlash with cost and the risk and is it really making any difference. So we can actually show that these names are making quite a bigger impact than just obviously  APD 00:55:16  alone then. You don't think that's really information that needs to be   00:55:25 ."
"Yeah, it does completely because it's a new concept. I've not heard of it before now, and it certainly is not something which I thought of before or thought there was even a need for. So I didn't even know there was a need, but now I can see that there clearly is."
"No, not really other than that we touched on earlier. I think it would be really important to people. I think if this information becomes more widely out in the common domain, then it's just really important to have a theory as to what's driving that and what's causing it because doctors are very inquisitive creatures by nature. And I think that's going to be questions that we'll probably ask almost universally to try to understand the mechanism by which it's achieving the great risk reductions and the reduce in mortality. It would be really important."
"Okay. Thank you very much. Okay, bye-bye."
"Okay. So I'm a respiratory physician. So I'm a respiratory consultant working in the UK. I'm with COPD and asthma leads on the airway leader on my site. I have a heavy involvement in both inpatient, outpatient clinic review, and also I have a slight slump in working in the community as well. So I do both inpatient, COPD outpatient, COPD, and a little bit of community COPD as well. I run a total of four clinics a week. Two of those are COPD clinics. These will tend to be quite severe COPD patients. And I would see approximately probably about 20 patients a week with COPD in outpatient clinics. So approaching about a hundred patients a month just in outpatient clinics as a minimum. And then obviously I've also got the inpatient load as well. And we have two significantly large respiratory ward of about 70 patients in total and a significant number about patients that actually COPD patients."
"Okay. So if we get someone who's presenting just with COPD or we've had a primary care referral into COPD, we'd expect these patients to be on at least dual treatment. So dual bronchodilators on a lab at ICS treatment as a minimum if they're hitting and they're exacerbating hospital. So usually I will tend to see patients which are on or have already been initiated on treatment. And they will either usually be on LA lab therapist or lab ICS therapy."
"Occasionally you'll get a referral coming through to the clinic where they say shortness of breath without a cause, and you'll work them up in you'll work out that they do have on underlying COPD, and you might very well start them on treatment at that stage. In terms of where we go for escalation of therapy and if they're on dual therapy, what would trigger us to make an escalation of therapy? Well, generally speaking, anyone who exacerbates or ends up with having a hospital admission, will end up on a triple and that's what the evidence base suggests. So if you've got someone who is the revolving door, exacerbates, they're coming into hospital, will end up on a triple. And it's as simple as that really. So they're either on dual bronchodilation, on lab or ICS treatment if they've got underlying symptomatic COPD. But if they are exacerbated, so requiring corticosteroids, or if they have hospital admissions, they end up on a triple."
"So we tend to follow...so here on our side, we tend to follow UK...guidance tends to follow gold guidance, but we've also started to follow nice guidance a little bit more. And nice guidance does say that if you've got symptomatic COPD, so if your breathless with underlying COPD, then dual therapy is the way to go. So there's been a bit of a switch in the UK in terms of the treatment. We used to use  inaudible 00:06:29  therapy, or just simple single bronchodilators when we used the manage COPD patients before. But the switch is being a little bit driven by what  inaudible 00:06:39  has said. So we see a lot of people on dual already, and if you're already on dual and then you start to exacerbate, then you end up on a triple at some point."
"So the fact that they're seeing us in hospital clinic, there will be quite a significant number because these are the patients who are on severe end of the spectrum disease. So if you were going to ask me how many on triples probably approaching about 50% of the patients I see in clinic will be on triples."
"I think that there's more and more education around where triple therapy fits in. There used to be an apprehension before, of not going too aggressively with COPD. Having said that, the data does suggest that early intervention and aggressive intervention is the way to go in these groups of patients because they will progress. So my feeling is that there's more comfort now. People are much more comfortable prescribing the right medication at the right point in COPD now. They used to go in a stepwise manner because they felt well, let's just go slow but surely because they're going to progress. And then we've got a medication where we can actually progress to. If we go for the triple too early, then we've almost limited our options further down the line. But there seems to be more of a mindset whereby if the feeling gives that this patient is going to benefit from a triple early on, because they're high frequent exacerbated or they're current hospital admission, then you'll see triple therapy being prescribed a lot more."
"Yeah. The topic debate is always around when to institute triples and when not to institute triples and that kind of, sometimes it's not up straightforward. I mean, if you've got a borderline case whereby they just sit somewhere on the border, you might be just a little bit apprehensive on going to a triple. Having said that the data supports that if you are...I suppose I keep going over about the same thing here, but the data is supportive of the fact that if you've got a frequent exacerbator, these patients should be on triple therapy. And I think when you see someone from the medical science team for these companies that are more certainly pushing that agenda."
All I'm getting at the minute is just the welcome slide.
"I can see, no, I can just see a welcome slide."
Do you want to go back off and try going back in again? Want me to do the same or...?
"Is that an internet connection then, maybe rather than the server problem?"
Um. Which is it? Do you want me to...I don't have the...I could reply to the email and see whether he replies. Let me just send them an email now. See if he replies.
"Maybe. I mean, I've just sent them an email. See what they say. I've just sent them an email on the link, which you just sent me only a few minutes ago. So hopefully-"
Hopefully. We'll give it a few minutes. Hopefully reply.
"Hold on. Let me just switch the phone call off then, okay? Let's try that."
" inaudible 00:21:39  Pretty much what the title tells you, that COPD varies. So we know that the low socioeconomic status is associated with health inequalities and risk of disease. So it's basically telling you that the spectrum of disease might be similar, but the burden of disease is different based upon where you might be in the world."
"Those figures are a little bit surprising because it's a condition which we try and manage as best we can in the community. But I suppose for example, where I work in a very comorbid area, we do have a highly admission rate. So although it's surprising, it's not that surprising."
"I would agree with that, to be honest with you. I mean, when we see emergency admissions coming through...maybe about a quarter, 30 to 35% of our acute intake, which comes through the respiratory related and predominantly that's all COPD."
"Just that there is more to COPD than just the condition itself. You know, socioeconomic status drives...the prevalence almost seems to follow a link associated with that, so."
"No, because it's all relatively...this is stuff which we tend to be educated about day in, day out. So there's nothing on there which is surprising."
"This is relevant. There's nothing on there which I don't agree with. So we'd have to put it a top of the scale and that slide, I mean, there's nothing on there which is contentious. There's nothing on there which is not correct as far as I'm aware."
"Well, the credibility is I suppose that these stats, they must have been taken and they must be credible. I suppose I don't know where they've pulled the statistics from, but we know. So for example, in the UK, we know that there's a significant variation in the COPD prevalence as you go to areas where there's socioeconomic issues. So I think it's credible."
"It's hard to say really, because I suppose it reinforces what we have been told. So I think it's a good reinforcement slide. If I'm honest, if I was to give it a scale, I'd probably give it a six."
It just says the same thing. Version of COPD variable between within countries.
"Just what it says, the burden of COPD varies considerably this between and within countries."
"Well, that's the same slide as we've just seen a second ago. It was the same slide."
"So that wasn't what we saw before. I've just seen a slide, which I've just seen now, was the previous slide. It was always on B. It was never on A in the first place."
"But don't worry. Don't worry. I mean, if you take my points from B and score those on B, and we can have a look at this one now, if you want."
"So that will make sense now because some of the stuff you were saying didn't really match what was on the slide, that slide. Okay. So this slide, I think it's a good slide, cause it is very much to the point. So globally, has equivalent long-term adult, second most common cause of admissions. Right. Is number three, estimated half of patients with are undiagnosed up 40%. So that now makes sense because that's what you were saying. So that's whether I couldn't. So if I to score that, so you want me to score it? So remind me again, what are the categories on this one?"
"Again, I think that this is very credible and relevant, so I'd give a seven on that. There's nothing on that   00:28:00 ."
"Credibility? So I would go...it's credible. The problem is I don't know where they pulled the statistics from, but they are in keeping with what we know about this. So I'll give it a six on credibility."
I would say that I would give it a six on motivation.
"So anything surprising on there? Not really, no. Because everything which is on there, it's nothing new. We're aware of these issues. So 40% of patients are readmitted with 90 days? I suppose it's a surprising figure, as I mentioned previously, because that's a highly admission rate. But I suppose it is what it is. So that figure is a little bit high, higher than I thought would be."
"Now we're on this one. Okay. So the month, so...we go in. So we're on A now, that's B. And so it's gone back to A again."
So we're on C. Seems to be flicking through them.
"Nothing really. All these reflects what we already knew, that there is a socioeconomic trigger in these patients, far more certainly. So the scores which I gave you earlier on are reflective of what I said on this slide."
"I see that. Yeah. So let's have a look at this. So you got the patient, that's why they shouldn't have a long term impact on patients. Okay. 77% of patients COPD have at least one moderate are getting exacerbation within a three year period. Quite high. And these have a significant impact on patient COPD lung function, physical activity, mental health quality. Okay. And then 50 to 78% COPD are not even reported. Mmm. Okay."
"Well, that's interesting because I don't know how they pick up on that then. Because how do you know they've exacerbated if it's not reported?"
"That number is very high. And the reason why I say that is that we see patients with COPD who reporting their symptoms. So I don't, obviously, we don't tend to see the patients who are not reporting their symptoms. So if that is the case, then that's a very, very high number."
"I could believe that. I could definitely believe that if they've got moderate...if they've got COPD, then nearly three quarters of them will have a moderate to severe exacerbation within three years. I could sort of believe that. The 50 to 78%, that is quite high and not even reported. It's interesting to say what they mean by that, but that's a surprising and alarming figure. So if there was anything else going to take home from that, is that we probably need to do much more for our COPD patients, especially these ones, which are not reporting symptoms."
"I think it's a good diagram because that's exactly how things go. COPD affects your lung function, it affects your deconditioning. It has an effect on your mental health and your quality of life. And then if you have poor outcomes with all those, it puts you at a greater risk of further COPD exacerbations. You know, the only thing I would say about that diagram, is it just seems to stop as a halt. And we know that's not a halt, that what would usually happen there is that, if I was to have done that, and I suppose, I don't know whether you're taking feedback on the diagram or not."
"But that service, the COPD exacerbation, that stopping it as a halt doesn't make sense. Cause what should happen is then there should be an adult going from further COPD exacerbation back to lung function, and then it filters back into the same pathway."
"Yeah, because it just stops there. But it doesn't stop. It's a spiral of the same condition."
50 to 78% of COPD exacerbation is not even reported.
"So relevance would be very high because relevance will be very high because there's some take home points there, which are really important. So I'll give it a seven in terms of relevance."
"So this is a difficult one, because I don't know where they've got the data from. I know you've got three studies, so I'm not doubting the credibility of the three studies above which talk about 77, the 50 to 78% of the COPD exacerbations. I mean, that's a very high figure. I'm not saying I don't believe it. It's just, it is a lot higher than what I'd expect."
"I know, I know it's just. It's not something which...I don't see. We don't go back and look at well, 50 to 78% of the patient with COPD and never report it. I mean, that's quite alarming if that's true."
I would give that a five because I just don't know enough about it.
"I think we'd have to give that like the top marker of a seven, because they've got all the person in points there."
"Yeah. So very good drafts, very straightforward, very easy to read and pretty much what that is showing you is that when you exacerbate your lung function doesn't go back to the previous baseline and that's pretty much what it's showing. And I think that's a very, very simple way of showing it."
"What's interesting about that is that, if you've got mild COPD."
"Your excess lung function decline per COPD exacerbation. It sort of makes sense. It sort of makes sense. If you've got milder COPD, you've got more lung function to play with to start with. So you're going to have more of a drop in your lung function. And as your disease gets more severe, you end up with less of a drop, but it's more significant because they've got no lung to start with. So it makes sense. It makes sense."
That you have to reduce exacerbation rates to have better outcomes in these patients.
"Yeah. Seven again. I'd give it all the way across. I mean, it's a very important point."
"So following one to two, 50% of patients are dead within five years. That sort of follows what I'm aware of, anyway. Follows grade three exacerbations are dead within three years. Okay. So risk...hospitalization was increased by, so...if you've had an exacerbation, 21%, the risk of death is increased by 80% with two moderate exacerbations. Highly impactful, that, actually. And then if we look at death, or probability of surviving. Well, that just reflects what they're saying in the data. Okay. Yep. Yep. Straightforward."
"That if you exacerbate, you have a higher mortality."
Optimization is the key. Optimization to reduce exacerbation rates is the key.
"Of their COPD. Yeah. If you optimize their COPD, you're going to reduce that exacerbation rate."
"So relevant, very relevant. So we go for the seven on that. And I'm scoring highly, but the thing is, is that in order for me to give it less than that, I have to find some sort of inaccuracy in it. And I can't really. So a seven on that."
"So I think that the slide is very impactful, but you have to read through it to get what's going on. So I'm going to give it a six. You might argue whether it could have been set out a little bit better than what it is. Seems a little bit wordy and you have to find your way around the slide a bit."
"Yes. Maybe two separate slides, or just have the graph based thing with just, you know, it's almost like half your slide is taken up with words, and a tiny little bit on the graph."
"Yeah, because the graph is telling you what's on the other bit."
"Yes, they do. They do, because we know that soon as you go to moderate to severe exacerbation, your outcomes are much worse. They do. They do, yes."
"Okay. Exacerbation goes beyond the lungs. COPD events increase in the first 10 days. That's definite. So we know about that anyway. So two times increase risk of MI, four times increase risk of stroke. Four times increase of risk of stroke in the first 30 days. Nine times increase for up to one year. Okay. But again, there's nothing groundbreaking on there which they're telling me, if I'm honest. But you know, it re-emphasizes the point of, it's not just about COPD. The consequences of poorer control COPD and other body systems."
"Yeah. So from a COPD perspective, we know that if you end up in a hospital with a COPD exacerbation, your risk of MI increases significantly. And we know that you get an increase in risk of stroke. So that is something that we are aware of anyway. But the numbers, a 40% increased risk of stroke is quite high. It's probably higher than what I thought it was going to be. We know that your risk of MI definitely goes up and then we've got four times risk in the first 30 days, 19 increase in risk for one year. I suppose it's sort of telling you the same thing but just different timelines."
"So, twofold. So one is, is good control of your COPD will improve your outcomes from a COPD, but from other aspects...so for well-controlled COPD will give you better outcomes in other disease areas such as stroke and MI. Yeah? And then it also on the other section, it also makes me aware that if I have the patient who's admitted with COPD, you have to have in the back of your mind that these patients that are an increase in risk of stroke and MI. So you have to just be wary of that."
So relevance is very good. So we're going to go for a seven with relevance.
It's very credible because there's lots of data to support this. So we're going to go over the seven with that.
"Again, I suppose on this, I'm always on this motivation thing. I'm always going to go off the way that the slide is presented. So A, it's just a little bit cramped up and like, it's giving you the same points just in different ways. So my feeling is, is that having 50% of your slide just with a big four times and 90%, realistically, maybe just graphical format of that rather than having it so word-heavy on nearly three quarters of the slide."
We'll give that a six. We're going to give it a six.
"I know there's a lot of information, which is pointing at the same thing. So they could just really say, listen, it is okay just to say, well, actually you've got two times increase in risk of MI, you've got 40% increase in risk of stroke. I think it's just different ways of saying the same thing."
"I suppose the reason why I'm saying that, is because it's sort of a bit of information overload in one slide. That if you were to look at short term and long term, it'd be better splitting it off."
Yes. Yes. So you got your short term benefits and your long term benefits. Cause the message gets lost in there.
"Yeah. Okay. So double...so cardiovascular patients COPD increased risk of death. So individuals with COPD it's two times increased risk of cardiovascular  inaudible 00:45:47  cause COPD cardiovascular associated with decreased quality of life. So COPD ischemic heart disease, 40 to 140%. So 40 to 140% increased risk mortality. COPD and diabetes, 54 to 70%, COPD and AS, 56%. COPD and heart failure, 30 to 90%. Okay."
"Well, it's basically describing different disease areas. That's what it's doing. So it's basically saying, okay, on the last slide it was talking about COPD and risk and mortality, et cetera. This one is breaking it down into disease areas. So if you got COPD, and you've got existing ischemic heart disease, that increases your risk of mortality. So again, we understand that, it's just making us aware that different disease areas alongside COPD increase your mortality."
"Yeah, I suppose. For me, what that's really telling me, if I'm completely honest, is that if you've got underlying comorbidity with COPD, your outcome is poor. That's what it's telling me. That's what that slide is basically telling me, that if you've got other comorbidities alongside COPD, you'll have a poorer outcome. If you're asking me what does it tell me you should do about it, I'm not too sure what it's telling me what we should do about that. Actually that slide doesn't tell you what we should be doing. It's just stating a point."
"No. It's not, it's not. It's just stating facts."
"Probably. If you were going to, I think that those four boxes are really, really good. They're really good because it gives you, can tell already your mortality goes up, but somewhere you could do say better control of your COPD will improve outcomes in those areas. Something like that. Cause as it stands, what it's basically telling you, it's just basically telling you that actually, if you have these other conditions, you have a higher mortality."
"Exactly. I think just something saying, better control of COPD will give you better outcomes in these groups."
"I think this one is not as strong, so six on this one."
"I think six. I'm giving it a six because I think it is motivating. I just think that it just lacks that, just that two or three words, which would've made it a little bit better."
"So cardiovascular disease, common cause of disease and efficiency or persist, moderate disease. DV related death, percentage of the deaths. Okay. Cardiac related lung cancer, respiratory related patients with moderate COPD are more likely to die from cardio than patients  inaudible 00:49:42 . Okay. Okay."
"I think it's clear. I sort of like this one because it's not too wordy and the graphs are representative, if I'm honest. Because in particular, for example. So I know left hand side is looking at five studies, the 39% COPD was due to cardiovascular. So that's stating the point. If I'm completely honest, you wouldn't necessarily need that on that left hand side, if I'm completely honest. You could just state the point. I think the point is put across really well on the right hand side graph. So basically it's saying if you've got moderate COPD, you're more likely to die of something other than COPD. Whereas if you've got COPD, which is severe, you're more likely to die of the COPD itself. And that's very impactful, very impactful."
"Because it's almost telling in you that early intervention in groups of patients is really important. So it's telling you, if you can keep that person in the moderate area of COPD, or more certainly that will have a knock on...the reason why I'm saying it's impactful is that, you might say well, actually, cardiac related deaths go up. But when you look at the comparison between the two, what you are saying is, if you can actually optimize your COPD patient as well as possible, from a COPD perspective, you're going to have a better outcome. And that's the reason why you are seeing the patients having more deaths from a cardiovascular perspective because they're having less deaths from a COP perspective. So it's almost proportionate. Once you've got to that severe end of the spectrum of COPD, it's too little, too late a little bit then."
"And again, I'll give it a six just because I think that you didn't need all that left hand slide."
"Okay. So CV death, especially driven by shared risk factors being products of exacerbation increase the risk of cardiovascular events and death. See COPD exacerbation hyper conflation, hydroxy tachycardia, cardiac  inaudible 00:52:40  Okay. And then shared risk factors. Cardiovascular risk. Okay. Yeah."
"That I suppose, on this one, the title says it all. So CV deaths and events are potentially driven by shared risk factors. So COPD itself, risk factor, the issues around cardiovascular disease. And then you've got cardiovascular disease as well, which is a risk factor. Those both At the same time, you have worse outcomes. I think the title in this one says it all."
"What you would say is, COPD exacerbation optimization of your COPD will reduce exacerbation. So not only is that good from a COPD perspective, but it's also good from a cardiovascular perspective."
"We know that if you've got the opening exacerbation, you have an increase in risk of cardiac events. That's proven, I mean, the data around that is massive."
"I quite like this actually. So I mean, I'll go with the seven on this."
I'll give it a seven as well. I think sometimes less is more. And I think there's the fact that this is not overtly crowded. I think the take-home point is quite straight forward here.
"The key to optimize passage  inaudible 00:55:01  exacerbation, increased references associated with high re-exacerbation with patients  inaudible 00:55:06  with not on ICS, yeah. Okay."
"So there's multiple bits on there. So the first two are straightforward. If you've exacerbated before, you're more like to exacerbate in the future. That's right. Increased breathlessness. You can have an...because if you've got high symptom burden, you're more likely to exacerbate. So the first two, straightforward, no issue. The third one is, I suppose, it is different to what you've got before,.because they're asking you to think about COPD slightly differently. So they're saying if you've got a patient who's got this eosinophilic phenotype of COPD and they're not on the right treatment, they will exacerbate. And I think this one, that bottom step is highly different compared to the other two bits."
"No, because there's loads of data around making sure that patients are on  inaudible 00:56:08  if they have an eosinophilic phenotype. So it's not, but it's an important point to make."
So we always look at eosinophil counts when making decisions around COPD therapy.
"No. Not in primary care, no way. No, no. Definitely doesn't occur in primary care and it will also not occur in secondary care, if that patient is not being seen by a physician with an interest in COPD."
"We do. So anyone who comes in through the front door as far as I'm concerned, the first thing I look at is I'll look at their previous admissions and number of exacerbations. So that covers the first two bits. But I also, the first thing I look at is their eosinophil count. And if they have a high eosinophil count, I need to make sure that patient is on an inhaled corticosteroid, cause if they're not, you'll be doing that patient a disservice. So I look at all those factors."
I would give this full marks all the way across the way.
"Mm. Each exacerbation accelerates the rate, subsequent exacerbations further increase in the risk of...each exacerbation accelerates the rate of subsequent exacerbations. Patients at risk of future exacerbations are those who have had previous exacerbations. So patient with COPD naught, then one, and then two. Term exacerbation. Okay. And then after the first severe exacerbation, the time between subsequent shortens. Okay. The thing is, this is a bit of a wordy slide. I'm having to have a look to see what they're actually getting at here."
"So what is basically saying to you, is exacerbation is a bad thing. If you a recurrent exacerbator, the shorter interval that you have between your exacerbations, the worse outcomes are."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah. If you've got frequent exacerbators, they do worse. So again, it's not telling us anything that we didn't know. I do think that the slide itself, that's not the best. Cause I've had to have a good read to see what that actually getting at, if I'm honest. Maybe it's just me. I think the one on the right hand side is better than the one on the left hand side."
"The one on the left hand side, it's just making a point. If you've had an exacerbation before, you're at increased risk further down the line. The more exacerbations you get, the worse you're going to end up. I think that's fair enough. I think the one on the right is good. I like the one on the right, because it's just showing you that time interval and the effects of that. So one of those, really."
"It is. So for example, whenever I counsel, if I give sessions and educational sessions to anyone, I'm always talking about increasing the time interval between first and second exacerbation, because the patients have a better outcome. So that doesn't come surprising to me, because we know that the data backs that up. If you have an exacerbation which occurs between the first and second very quickly, then that exacerbation rate goes up significantly. So yes, I think people know that. Yeah."
"Well...I suppose what it's telling you, if I was to think about what that's telling me, is that's telling me to make sure that you optimize your patients, however that might be. Yep? So it doesn't necessarily mean that you go to a triple. It's making sure that patient is on the right therapy at the right time, and you've optimized them from every aspect. I think that's what it's telling me. And some people might say, well actually that means just start a triple straight away. It doesn't mean that if I'm honest. It means that you've optimized that patient appropriate to that patient. Just because you've had one exacerbation doesn't mean you go on to a triple straight away."
"The critical point for me, is basically...again, it's all the same thing, is reducing exacerbation rates. That's pretty much what it's about."
I'm going to go with sixes across the way on this one.
"I just think that it took me a bit of a while to understand what they were getting at on these slides if I'm honest, I had to have a good read around."
"That if they have eosinophil, then you need to treat them with inhaler corticosteroids."
"Yeah, and I actually quite like this because it's very straightforward. Simplicity is the key. So it's very, very straightforward. You know, if you've got an eosinophil count, give them inhaler corticosteroids."
"I like this one. I like this. So again, I suppose I'll give it sevens across the way. I'm having to compare one to the other. So it's slight differences, but for me I think this is straightforward and very-"
"Okay. So this is right at the end, then, is it?"
"Yeah. So treatment optimization across four areas can help to transform the care of COPD and reduce exacerbations. Identifying patients with COPD, so early. Yep. Quantification of future risk for the phenotype. Okay. Optimum management of patients' COPD, follow-up for patients with COPD. A combination of treatment of patients with required optimal, so smoking cessation, pulmonary rehab, pharmacological treatment. Okay. So I suppose this slide is nothing that I've not seen before. We always see a slide like this on educational slides."
"22% reduction in exacerbation with ex-smokers, 42% with problem rehab and 30%...I suppose they're not surprising. We would've hoped that smoking cessation might give you a bigger swing in terms of reduction in exacerbation risk. But you know, we might argue that the fact that once you've got the damage to your lungs, you've got the damage to the lungs. You try to prevent further damage from occurring. I think the one which is very impactful for me is pulmonary rehab. Then look, about 42% reduction in mortality. That's fantastic. That's it. You know, if there's anything you want to sell, this is something which is relatively cheap and without side effects also."
"So the pharmacological one is, it's almost like it comes somewhere in the middle. It's not without importance almost certainly. It's very, very important. It's just interesting how they position those aren't they? It's interesting how they've gone 22, 42, then 30, you know, in the positioning of those."
"I'm just wondering why, why would they position it like that? I'm not too sure. Yeah. But again, pharmacological treatment makes massive differences to patients, but we know that it's not just about pharmacological treatment in terms of getting good outcomes for COPD. And you can see that, just look at pulmonary rehab. So there's nothing surprising in there."
"So let's have a look. So reduction of moderate severe exacerbations, risk for triple therapy versus  inaudible 01:05:59 . So 30%. So reduction of moderate severe exacerbations risk for triple versus lama. Yeah. I suppose it does, doesn't it? Because it's saying, if you go to a triple or dual therapy, in that right group of patients, you're going to have an impact itself about 30% reduction. So yes it does. It does. And it definitely makes you think about early intervention in those groups of patients."
Okay. So what would you give P out of seven?
"So I think in terms of the pertinent points, I should say so, seven. I would go with...its hard to say, you know, right. Cause I'm converting one to one and then I'm like giving another one another score. It's harsh for me to mark it down, but its not as good as some of the other slides."
"I think it's credible, it's credible, so seven."
"The points are motivating, but I think the set-up could have been slightly difference. So I'm going to give it a six."
"I suppose the main thing for me, early intervention and the correct intervention. I think that's the key."
"I think physicians...I think the biggest challenge is educating clinical staff around this. The biggest problem we see around people not escalating therapy and COPD is they don't understand the consequences sometimes of not doing it, or not treating aggressively. And so I think the biggest challenge is education around this."
"Because I suppose it was nothing on there which was contentious. If you went from some of the values, some of the values might have been surprising. But there only surprising because they're a bit higher than what I thought they were going to be. But the take-home point was the same thing. We knew that there were issues around those areas."
I think some of the slides were highly compelling and some of them just stating facts.
"So I suppose the thing is, is that this is what sounds like it's a  inaudible 01:11:20  triple. So there's, again, there's nothing on there. There's nothing on there which is surprising. So we know that the triple is going to be better in terms of exacerbation rate, better is better in terms of all cause mortality. So all these factors which you've just shown me now, I would expect it. I would expect the triple to have a better mortality rate. I expect to triple to have better exacerbation rates."
I think it reinforces it. I think it reinforces the pertinent points. It's an aggressive early treatment in the right patient. I think that. So it reinforces that for us.
"So, exacerbated. That's the first thing. So exacerbating COPD patient."
"No, I would go with inhaler steroids early on in your COPD. So if you've got eosinophilic phenotype, then your benefit of inhale corticosteroids is very early. If you've not got eosinophilic phenotype, you might go with your bronchodilators. But what overrides all of that is if you exacerbate, then the benefit is with the triple."
I would think that it would come as soon as you start to exacerbate.
"It's looking at everything, the benefit around everything there."
"The only point about that slide was, we mentioned about, on the right side, that needs an arrow going back   01:15:11 ."
"I like this slide, so I'd keep this one in. Yeah."
"Normally, this is probably one of, if not the highest impact one as far as I'm concerned."
"See, this is important, but I'm not too sure whether you needed it all. This is the one where I felt as though it was important point to make, but almost like you were almost doubling up, whereas the graph would've done the trick, really."
This is the one where I felt as though they needed splitting up.
Yeah. Yeah. Cause short term and long term impact.
"So again, what did I say on this now? So I said..."
"Yeah. I think the reason why it was, is that I would have to say that I would probably remove this just based upon the way the slide's been done. Because it's not...it's just stating facts. It's not saying better control of your...it's just saying COPD versus  inaudible 01:17:06  heart disease..I'm being a bit harsh here, but it is really just, it states in facts rather than anything else."
"Yeah. Exactly. As it stands, I would remove it. Not to say that it's not a good slide, but I just think it doesn't say enough about optimizing treatment of COPD there."
I like the graph on the right hand side. I think the left could just be one line.
"If I was to keep it in, I'd probably keep it in if I had a choice."
I like this one. Yeah. I like this. So this is one of the other ones which I felt that this was a high impact slide.
"And this one. This one was probably...so if I'm going to go for three high impact slides, this is the other one."
This one I had to have a good read around.
I would keep the right hand side graphing on the slide.
"So the thing is, is this is an excellent slide. It's an excellent slide. I don't know whether it's repeating what we said on the previous slide around the eosinophils though."
"This one, yeah. It's sort of telling you the same thing, but in a...so if you were going to keep them both in, you'd change the order whereby this one came straight after that slide, not to have it sort of split out."
Yeah. P is the summary slide. So I would keep this in definitely because you need it.
Is early aggressive intervention in COPD.
I think the education around it is better than what it was before. But I think that there's still a lot to be done around it if I'm honest.
"I suppose...I always say to people that the aim of this education should be at the front door. Should be right at the initiating stages of therapy. If they were going to put any emphasis in our education, it should be in primary care, because that's where you really make the massive impact in these patients."
"I think if you want to do anything on impacts, it's that slide there. So that slide."
"Yes. Because it shows that every time you hit your exacerbation, you've lost that lung function. I think that's a fantastic slide of showing that patient, but if they exacerbate, they won't go back to their usual baseline."
"It will. It will because of the right hand side, when it shows the mild, moderate, severe, very severe. Because it's almost telling you to intervene early on."
"This one is good, but that other, if I'm honest, that other one, which had the eosinophils on, that was a better one. Keep going. Yeah."
"So the reason why, is they both back each other up. So the first slide is telling you early intervention, even in that mild to moderate group of COPD, you're going to have a massive impact. And this one here. So if you go through that one here, so that is-"
"Yeah. And then this one, sorry, this one which you've got here is telling you have to look at the eosinophils. Yes. You have to look at the eosinophils because if you don't, you miss the trick in COPD."
No problem. No problem. Thank you very much.
"Hi everyone, good evening. Thank you so much for patient waiting. We now have our doctor on the line. Diane, you may go and start."
"Yeah, so I'm a respiratory physician and I work in a teaching hospital, in a major city in the UK and my interest is actually is COPD but also includes patients on home oxygen, and also kind of sleep disorder breathing. So patients on CPAP as well. That's when I've seen the, email from, the research company, I thought this actually fits my interest so to speak with regards to COPD because I've seen loads of patients with this condition, so, yeah."
"I mean, to be honest now things have now things vary obviously quite a bit with-"
"Of COVID in the sense that COVID has taken over most of our respiratory work, but I would say over 200 patients a month, that includes, patients with the COPD the whole spectrum. So from mild COPD to severe or very severe COPD on oxygen on home ventilation, both inpatient and outpatient as well."
"Yeah okay, yeah pre COVID. I mean, obviously now things have the-"
"Yeah, I think the triple therapy has taken over quite a bit and I think one of the reasons would be compliance, because our patients are historically, poorly compliant to inhalers. So Obviously having all three substances delivered through the same inhaler, it does help with the missing doses and things like that. It's also the cost effective issue as well, because we can give for the price of a single device instead of two or three devices. So, is a cost saving issue as well."
"Yeah, 30, 40%. I would say we try to... if they meet criteria, goal criteria for, as in guidelines criteria for triple therapy would be a 30, 40%."
"Other than that, obviously we don't want COPD patients to be on a long term steroid inhaler due to kind of risk of pneumonia or other atypical microbacteria infection and all sorts of complications from using the steroid inhaler or unless they have asthma, or they are multiple exacerbators. We prefer them on a dual bronchodilator that's kind of the policy for COPD. But because we see quite a few patients who exacerbate and we see them during admission, at least at the point of admission, we normally start them on triple therapy. And then when we see them in clinic, we kind of review the risk factors underlying comorbidities, whether they have bronchiectasis or an underlying lung condition, just to mitigate the exacerbations really. So at least 30, 40%."
"That's a good question. I mean, it all depends on the kind of severity of the symptoms, because to be honest now, with COVID, we could be going back to the COVID situation, the use of spirometry has in the lung function for diagnostics, has come down significantly. Just to give you an idea in my hospital, the lung function service was shut for two years. I mean, because ventilation issues and so, the diagnosis was quite difficult."
"So we've relied on outpatient on kind of community center for simple spirometry to diagnose COPD, but we mainly rely on admissions to hospitals or at least hospital admission with COPD exacerbation and symptoms. Symptom of breathlessness, we use mMRC for how far can they walk. MMMRC if three or four, or at least the hospital admission in the last 12 months would fit for us to start them on a triple therapy. Based on the kind of Gold D."
"I think, but mean usually, is the Gold D and so the, stages C and D and then obviously, because with COPD we have the whole spectrum. So, once we have access to lung function and complex lung function, we can evaluate these patients for kind of lung decline, other options, like lung volume deduction. So, we look into other more complex issues, but just for starting treatment I think, and then obviously when they come to hospital, we can't do spirometry within six weeks, while they are recovery from the exacerbation."
"So that's another factor for us to think about. So we would normally... is more of a practical issue to start the multiple therapy on the time of exacerbation then refer them for smoking cessation, pulmonary rehab, and then confirm the diagnosis later on. On the other hand, the GPS in the primary care lines, the GPS would screen for all smokers about 40, we have a register, and then they have evidence if they have chest infections, symptoms, breathlessness so they should do an annual spirometry on these patient just to screen actively for COPD."
"But again, I think with the COVID, obviously everything has changed within primary care as well. So a lot of COPDs, I'm sure they've been missed to be honest, we've seen as well. So probably they be sitting at home, not coming to hospital, just try to keep themselves safe, at least until we got the vaccine and now just to give you an idea, now we have one or two exacerbations of COPD compared to three ago, this time of the year we'll have loads, we'll have a least a dozen on the ward. So, yeah."
"So, I mean, obviously when it's normal, we assess the common factors and exposure to smoking exposure to biofuels, even in non-smokers is more common, is coming up quite a bit. And then, we investigate other causes of breathlessness, such as-"
"Heart failure, for example is a common scenario. We had from primary care now, obviously, just to give you an example, we have an electronic system and they refer through that sometimes just for advice. Other times, the advice actually can be changing to a clinic appointment and we had someone recently referred by primary care for persistent breathlessness, but the patient had a significant cardiac comorbidity. They had stents put in, they had an ICD, so was clear."
"It was someone I think, in the sixties, never smoked and the imaging that we've seen of the thorax, they had a CT was clear in terms of lung field. So didn't have fibrosis or obvious underlying lung condition. So I mean, obviously this is quite an obvious one, but sometimes the patients can have an overlap of airway disease, asthma, and COPD, but normally the assessment of breathlessness will involve a lung function."
"At least a simple spirometry if we have ability to do a reversibility test or diffusion, to look at absorption of the helium and see whether that is impaired and also lung volumes to look for hyperinflation, these are the things we look at. And obviously we need at least a CT of the chest, of the thorax just to look for emphysema or underlying lung condition, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, things like that."
"And then we can expand the investigations with cardiac investigations, at least a basic cardiogram. And then we do have of access, although it's quite limited because of COVID and this being in a tertiary center within the trust, we do have access to CPETs, cardiopulmonary exercise testing. So let's say for someone in which we've investigated them thoroughly, but actually they don't have a significant cardiac disability and there's not an obvious lung cause for the breathlessness, we can do this cardiopulmonary exercise testing, to see whether it's just the conditioning or whether is more of the cardiac component or the respiratory component. That is the main conflict. Yeah, so we do have access to a variety of investigations."
"Yeah, so obviously we would need to optimize that with a cardiologist, with a specialist. So we normally refer them to at least for a general cardiology clinic where they can do. I think it depends, they'll normally... whether they're looking at... I'm not a cardiologist, but from, from what I've seen, they will assess the valves, they will assess the heart function. So a CMR cardiac MR, if they're thinking of heart failure or an angiogram, if they're thinking of ischemic of formal disease and they'll just investigate. Usually is the cardiac MR would be the test of choice for these patients after the basic obviously echocardiogram."
"Yeah. So I think it is quite a common combination we've seen at least with our patients with COPD. Up to 60% of them will have an underlying comorbidity often is cardiac in nature and they present with pulmonary hypertension and they can have heart disease as well. So we'll try to optimize obviously both aspects of the respiratory condition with inhaler and oxygen. For example, if they meet criteria for oxygen or ventilation, if they have episodes of hyperopic failure and also optimize the heart function as well, or the-"
"Yeah, that's a good point. So I think, another common one would be depression and anxiety, especially with CV COPD with the conditions obviously they are breathless, they can't leave the house, they'll get depressed. They have a lot of muscle wasting and essentially, they're trapped in a vicious circle, which we try to break with pulmonary rehab and smoking cessation if they're still smoking. So, yeah anxiety and depression is a common comparability as well. And with our overweight patients sleep disorders or obesity, hyperventilation and CPAP with overweight patients is a common scenario as well."
"Yeah, I mean, this is something obviously we need to address from the very beginning because these patients being kind of COPD patients, often continue to smoke, and then obviously they have a significant cardiovascular risk because of that. So, I mean, the ones that we see are often... we are working in a deprived area for major city. So we see patients who haven't been to hospital, they've been smoking for, 30, 40 years sometimes coming from abroad."
"So there's quite a low education in terms of awareness of symptoms and what they need to do. So this is something where, one of the challenges we're facing, just try to engage them into therapy. Sometimes there's a language barrier, they miss the clinic appointments. So you just... but then, it is absolutely a good point, the risk of cardiovascular illness is quite significant in these patients with COPD."
"I mean, we go by the guidelines, which is... our trust essentially has our organization has adapted guidelines according to what inhalers we have on the formulary. And we just go by staging and by the guidelines we use goal guidelines mainly sort of adapted to our catchment area and to the medication we have access to."
"Yeah, I mean, obviously, with regards to the... because we see often the sequence we work closely with a cardiologist and, not to mention that part of, we're not doing just, unlike other specialties, for example, like cardiology, which are exclusively looking after only cardiac patients, we do look after GI Inpatients. So GI medicine patients, including patients with heart failure and so part of our job, we do see these patients as well. So it's not a common scenario, for example, with someone to come to hospital with an exacerbation of COPD and the compensated heart failure and to be under our team. If we think, for example, there's more specialty input required, then we can get the cardiologist to review them, or, we can get their opinion. So we work quite closely with them."
"I think it's on a case to case discussion really. It depends on the severity of COPD as well. It depends on the overall cardiac comorbidity, if there is heart failure present and then we'll just try to mitigate the risk factors, the smoking, the alcohol, everything that is factored in."
"I think this is, this is part of the... is a common scenario really. So it's just to look into and ask the right question. So, and start the ball rolling in terms of investigations. So look for pulmonary hypertension, which is a common factor for someone with CV COPD optimizer so optimize the inhalers if they've been on, on inhalers before. So obviously inhaler technique we using check devices, we have respiratory specialist nurses who can review these patients, try to see if they exacerbate and to reduce the admissions to hospital with exacerbations."
"We do have even a community service with specialist nurses. So they will facilitate early discharge for these COPD patients and they'll see them at home within two weeks of discharge to optimize them, check their oxygen saturations, and try to keep an eye on them once they've gone home. Yeah, and then obviously we pick some cardiac comorbidities. We will look into these and we can refer them to the cardiologist if needed."
"No, not really. So I think the COPD is as far as I'm concerned, we're following the guidelines. So if the patient has, for example, more than two exacerbations in a year, we'll be on a triple therapy. We just need to get the right inhaler for the patient, obviously, in terms of dexterity patient flow, to be able to make sure. This is something we start when the patient is in hospital. So respiratory nurse will come at the bedside, will assess the patient risk factors again, inhaler technique. If we think they have capacity and they, we can train them in terms of a self-management plan for COPD, and then we'll provide them with a rescue pack of steroids and antibiotics."
"If we think again, they might have dementia, or they might not be able to pick up scientific exacerbations, then obviously we wouldn't give them a rescue pack. So I think it's quite clear we have a pathway with regards to, diagnosing these patients and criteria to start them on a dual therapy in opposed to triple therapy. Again, if they have highers in fields, there's a subgroup of patients with COPD exclusively, not asthmatics would benefit from triple therapy from a steroid inhaler and dual bronchodilators and exacerbations and this is what we do when they come into hospital."
"We can also do this other point of previewing clinic, if we notice that actually they still exacerbate, but they're on the dual bronchodilator, we can increase the therapy by adding the steroid and then just look for underlying cause of exacerbations whether they have bronchiectasis to treat that maybe do bronchoscopy to look for colonization for different germs to try to mitigate the exacerbations."
"With anything obviously. So the more risk factors they have, the chances for them, for example, to come to hospital or things to go wrong is higher. And even, resuscitation decisions as well. If they have, for example, another organ failure, if they have heart failure in relation to COPD. That's another factor for prognosis. So, it all adds up in the end. So, that's why with these patients, we would normally kind of look actively for underlying cardiac comorbidities quite early."
"Yes, absolutely. I mean, we often see, for example, patients who underwent... they are under cardiologists for various conditions. Sometimes they have heart failure or ischemic heart disease, and then the patient is still breathless, and then obviously it comes to the question, whether they have an underlying lung condition that may be contributing to their breathlessness, especially if the patient, for example, may be overweight or might have, other like sleep disorders or other pathology. So we do get them, refer to us for assessment."
"Yeah, so these are independent pathways. So obviously the patients if they have an underlying... let's say if a patient has cardiac pathology, heart failure, you'll be seen by the cardiologist regularly. We do have regular heart failure nurse clinics and every six months or so, they will have a review. Then if the patient proves to have a significant lung condition like CV COPD or something to warrant surveillance, we can do that. We have specialist nurses who have kind of COPD nurse lead clinics. We do tend to keep an eye and retain all patients on oxygen. So we do have an oxygen service and we will keep, an eye on them, lifelong essentially-"
"Yeah, I mean, obviously I think it all comes down to, they're definitely connected. It comes down to the smoking in the end, which obviously is not affecting just the lungs, is a significant cardiovascular risk factor. So, ischemic heart disease for how, hypertension and so on. So it's, quite comes down to basics to of the smoking essentially."
"I mean, definitely through exacerbations in chronic hypoxia for these patients."
"Yeah to some extent, yes. So let's say if smoking is stopped, then there's a... let's say the risk factor has been mitigated, but then it comes down to, there are different phenotypes as well with COPDS. Some of them tend to exacerbate and they are prone to hypercapnic failure. These are the group that would need home ventilation, but these are the group usually with severe COPD. We see, a lot function, less than 50% probably predicted, some of them might need oxygen as well. They have chronic hypoxia, which again is a trigger for pulmonary hypertension and cardiac comorbidity."
"Yeah I mean, is essentially you know is two or more conditions in the same individual. So obviously they're interconnected. So if we got someone let's say with severe COPD, who has significant cardiac comorbidity that will limit the quality of life and then can have an impact on the survivor. so-"
"Or the prognosis of COPD? So I think it's another problem for the same individual. It depends, again, this is too generic. So it comes down to only a certain group of patients, usually the end of the spectrum with, severe COPD who have underlying cardiac condition. So is quite a generic discussion about a broad subject."
"Yeah, so let's have a look. So it says on the title, Cardiac and Cancer Related Death, you present a substantial proportion of reported causes of death in COPD. We got a percentage on the right box, across four studies, up 39% of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular causes. And then we got, we got four studies on the columns, and then we got the percentage of death on the axis. We got cardiac related, cancer related, respiratory related and other, right. Okay and there's an asterixis at the bottom percentages and okay. A total number of definite study. So I think it's just a comparison between four studies in terms of, cardiovascular and cancer kind of certification of a percentage of death to these patients."
"No, not really. I mean, obviously it varies a lot. So, I didn't mention anything about cancer. We do see for in this group of patients with COPD, we do see a lot more because obviously we kind of actively screen them with CTs and we look for other conditions, other underlying lung conditions, we do pick up loads more, cancer for example, in these COPD patients in opposed to I don't know, patients with asthma, let's say so. And these are all smoking related, so it's a common scenario."
"Yeah. I think it's referring to one of the studies, which mentions the scope, I think is the same percentages. Isn't it? The same percentages. So, which is probably the highest."
"I mean, the only thing is... my only question was what in the other column, what was included there? Cause it is quite variable. So it up to 23%, I was just wondering what they've included there.  00:35:56 ."
"I think it's quite clear the message is quite obvious. It's clear, but yeah."
"So this one, I think is more descriptive. So it's a bit difficult to follow, in the way the information is presented. So let's have a look. So cardiovascular comorbidity significantly increase the burden of COPD and the risk of death. Individuals with COPDS have twice greater the risk of having cardiovascular disease than those without COPD. And then we got on the left, increases of mortality versus COPD alone and versus cardiovascular condition alone. And then we got ischemic heart disease, plus COPD. We got, an increase 40 to 140% and then versus systemic COPD plus COPD 27 to 50%. I think I'm a bit puzzled here. And then we got heart failure with COPD. So obviously this is a comparison in terms of risk mortality, but the way the information is presented, it seems to be high on the COPD, the left side, on the left box, but I think it's not-"
I'm not quite clear what they wanted to represent with that. I think the information to me it's not that obvious.
"You know, the information varies, so let's take the first symbol with the heart, it says, ischemic heart disease plus COPD increased 40 to 140%. But then, again you've got the same ischemic heart disease, plus COPD increased risk of 27 to 50%. But it's the same, so-"
"Right? Yeah, I don't know. I think I feel this is not very obvious from the... I don't know. Maybe representation should have been maybe slightly different."
"I don't know, a pie chart or something like that, something more obvious, like a column or a different presentation."
"I mean, we know that obviously patients with COPD, especially the CV ones, they have all sorts of like we mentioned cardiac comorbidities and risk of cardiovascular disease. So it's nothing surprising. I thought just the way the information was presented."
"Yeah. Okay so let's look damage from COPD exacerbation goes beyond the lungs. There is cardiovascular complications, such as MI stroke is increased following the model exacerbation, risk of MI doubles within five days, and then let's have a look what we have here. We got one to five days, six to 10, this is the risk. What do they want to represent here? We got MI, stroke with last DMI, the risk of MI doubles within five days and 40% increase a risk of stroke within 10 days. Sounds good. This one is more clear and then we asterix at the bottom list of MI, that's fine cause the cross is not statistically significant and two crosses model exacerbation were defined the prescription oral steroids and prescription for antibiotics. Okay, that's fine."
"Yeah, I mean, there's nothing new because often we see patients coming with an exacerbation then developer an MI during admission. So is a common scenario as well. Especially for CV COPD patients."
"Yeah again, I think the two diseases, they're part of the same entity really. So it proves that actually we need to address both COPD and respiratory and cardiac comorbidity."
"Yeah again, I think that with COPDS, we see, it's quite interesting. I would, especially the risk of stroke I didn't come across patients with COPD exacerbation and stroke, within, let's say roughly the same amount of period, but is a good point, actually."
I think it's surprising when seeing the figures  00:43:16 
"I mean, not necessarily differently. It's just to obviously to try to address, if there are other underlying comorbidities to look into those more solely in a way."
"Yep. Okay let's have a look. So we've got products X, this says the whole post mortality versus dual bronchodilator course, mortality. So we got a Kaplan-Meier curve here and let's have a look. We got dual bronchodilator with blue, we got ICS/LABA gray, and with purple we've got triple therapy, right. Now okay secondary endpoint, the number of weeks is 52 weeks, okay. And products X show a non-significant 28 reduction in mortality, I assume versus ICS, okay."
"Yeah, so I think is one is quite clear in terms of what shows a deduction in mortality, the type of therapy product compared to the combinations taken separately, steroid example bronchodilator, or dual bronchodilator."
"I mean, again, we don't have much information on the slide and then I can see a value there that is not statistically significant. We don't know how many patients were, recruited in the study and things like that. Was it not statistically significant because of lack of subjects recruited or it's just a slide which shows good outcome kind of, Kaplan-Meier survival, so mortality curve for this triple therapy device."
"Yeah, again, I mean, obviously this is interesting information, but I think it's not enough with regards to a slide I'll be interested to read more about it, but is not enough information on the slide essentially. And with triple therapy, we've normally seen, obviously the results are better than single combinations in terms of, exacerbations and even mortality as well. But the fact that the study is not significant and we don't know how many subjects were included, then again, these are two potential limitations of the study so to speak."
"Yeah. Okay let's have a look. We've got products X with purple, we've got dual bronchodilator, and then we got a steroid and a long acting bronchodilator, and we even have a table, yeah. Major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular causes appeared to account for the majority of mortality treatment difference versus dual bronchodilator. And then we go to table in terms of percentage. This is the absolute number, I assume there. Okay cardiovascular respiratory issue could be pneumonia, cancer off treatment desk, okay."
"Okay. So let's have a look. So we've got percentage of patients, cardiovascular events, right? And then we go cardiovascular death, nonfatal stroke, nonfatal MI, and confirmed major adverse cardiovascular events, right. So it looks like the products I'm trying to work it out cause it's a bit confusing. So, we got product that we got the triple therapy, the product X, which seems to have a higher percentage or at least is another higher column of, that. We don't know it says percentage of patients. right. So that will work out just under 1.5%, okay."
"To be honest, I'm trying to work it out. Yes and no, so I think it looks like, in terms of major cardiovascular events, they seem to be lower than the dual bronchodilator, which is good. But I don't know whether, this seems to be just a comparison of percentages. So I'm not sure in terms of statistical significance and where was this the same study or-"
"Yeah, I think it looks good on, on the figures that obviously we want less side effects and you know, less events. So, it seems to have nearly half of the number of kind of cardiovascular related deaths, the triple therapy in opposed to dual bronchodilator. But again, I'm not sure whether this was a randomized control CT, randomized control trial, and things like that."
"How, was data collected and how was the study planned? Because sometimes was this just an observational study in which case these events can be to some point random. Or what is just a result of their treatment really, in which case, definitely we want the product with less events and with less figure on mortality."
"So let's say products X, show the reduction in cardiovascular death, 62%, right. Versus the dual bronchodilator."
"Yeah, I think it comes down to the same question about the significance of the study. Whether this was because... I think comes down to the evidence, otherwise it looks good, it looks amazing, but you know, and why the data is not statistically significant? Was it because we didn't have enough subjects or as in how well can we rely on that? Otherwise we would just put   00:54:04 ."
"So I think disregarding the slide, I think the whole concept is actually, if the patient meets the criteria for a triple therapy, in terms of exacerbations, highers in fields, then this would be something to consider. So, I think would be another evidence to bear in mind."
"Yeah again these are all interconnected cases, but again, we need to be a bit careful with regards to the downside, the fating. I think it looks like here, we're comparing the dual bronchodilator as an inhaler, and we got the triple therapy inhaler, and then we're asking are any of these better in reducing the cardiovascular risks? So I think, they're both useful in treating COPD patients at different stages of the illnesses."
"So, I think, again, we can't always prescribe every multiple therapy just because the study showed that actually, it does look better for... in terms of surveillance for these patients for a period of time, or whether including cardiovascular risks and including mortality. So I think it's useful information probably it proves the value of triple therapy, which we know about, so we're using deductively, whether that is for everyone or for all COPD patients, that's another discussion."
"Oh yeah. So it would be the ones that, CV COPD patients, multiple exacerbations. So at least two exacerbations in a year, or at least the hospital, so major exacerbation requiring hospital admission, and then also, symptomatics, and obviously the subtype of COPDs with high."
"So let's see, what's ARR the magnitude of ARR-"
"Okay, absolutely risk reduction, that's fine. But, oh yeah, absolutely special. Sorry I do apologize I've seen it at the bottom. LAMA/LABA, yeah right. Statin versus placebo, and then go statin versus placebo. ACC inhibitor versus placebo.Then we got on the right, tile one X."
"To some extent, yes maybe, but again, I think is the way we look at different things as in, for these patients. It does seem obviously, it has significant impact for these patients. The value of adding an inhibitor product for these patients. So, yeah."
"So, again, there's not much information. Let's see product X, we got triple therapy and then we got the number to take 80 and 121, mm hmm okay that's fine. I mean, it looks good, but I'm not sure what's the difference between product X and product Y or is it just the branding or why is it one better than the other?"
"Mm yes. I mean one, obviously seems to be a bit better, but then again, probably we need more information on that."
"I mean, obviously randomized control data and then practical it is such as, if the product available on the formulary can be prescribe it. Is it accessible to our patients? What is the price? They're assuming they're both on the formulary, assuming they have the same for similar price, then obviously we'll prescribe the one with better outcome."
"Yeah, I think it's looking at things from a different angle, from adding the cardiovascular component, which is something really common and really important for our patients. So I think it proves, is a very clever way to look at and improves the care for these COPD patients I think is a good thing. Sounds good."
"Yeah, I mean, these are all intercalated, but I think, we will probably need to look into having these introduced at the guideline level. So, we can implement all that really, but otherwise it sounds quite promising."
"Yeah. I mean, again, we kind of practice evidence based medicine, so would be quite not reasonable me to go tomorrow and start changing treatment on, on patients just because I've seen a few interesting sides."
"I think there's a lot of evidence, with regards to the cardiovascular comorbidity for these patients. So I think, and the fact that we get data coming through to show us all that evidence, I think is really a good thing because it'll, it'll only help these patients addressing, or maybe, as with regards to inhalers and treating the COPD patients, there is quite a well known low compliance to therapy. So I think, increasing that or targeting that would be quite good for these patients, because you can only help with the cardiovascular side of things as well."
"Yeah, again, obviously, we normally look at exacerbations and with exacerbations is a risk of mortality as well and symptoms. So, but we need to... all that evidence would need to be kind of at a randomized control, trial, solid data, to be able to climb into, into guidelines and formulary, and that will empower us to make the right decisions for these patients. But yeah, absolutely sounds good. It sounds like-"
"Okay, no problem. I would've thought that cause I knew they have... I think they have a cell, they have a triple therapy coming through, which obviously it adds to the current ones we use, which are the Timbo and trilogy. So again this is another... it's a good thing because our patients have got again another device which can be potentially available and even having even more data on that is a good thing."
No problem thank you. Thanks for everything
"Okay. Yeah. I'm a cardiology consultant and I'm the lead for heart failure at our hospital, but I'm a general cardiologist. So I do everything really, including cardiac catheterization, arrhythmias, and so on. And yeah, that's it really, I think."
"Right. Okay. Yes, that's right. Around here, the population's quite elderly so with the in-patients, the average age is actually 89. But the out-patient cohort is a bit younger, probably 70s to 80s. It's that sort of age group."
"Right. I'm the lead for heart failure, so I suppose half my practice is heart failure, and then coronary disease is another important part. And atrial fibrillation is an important part as well."
"Yes, because of the age, nearly all of them have comorbidities and I suppose most the most common one is probably high cholesterol and hypertension, and then diabetes and COPD are common as well. They do have other medical conditions as well, but those are probably the most common."
"Okay. Well, I suppose I forgot to mention obesity, but that's a common one. But in terms of treatment, diabetes and COPD, because there's more treatments now than when I first started. Whereas for hypertension and high cholesterol, I'm pretty much au fait with treatments for those."
"Basically, for those two conditions in particular, diabetes and airways disease, we do refer a lot to our respiratory colleagues, and nowadays that usually means referring to the relevant specialist nurses. So usually with diabetic patients or COPD patients, you get the relevant nurse and sometimes you have to refer to the relevant consultants as well."
"Well, I suppose, obviously we try to manage these conditions ourselves as well. But I think because the treatment pathways are changing, because there's more treatment options, the challenges of referring means that there's sometimes delay in getting the patient seen, isn't it? And therefore when you see the patient in clinic or in in-patients, you can't make all the decisions right there and then. You're waiting for colleagues to come. So that's one challenge. And then another challenge is that sometimes the disease is so severe that even when you call the specialist people in, there may not be much more they can do."
"What do you mean about overlap? Do you mean, do we work as a team for some patients or...?"
"I think it's becoming more teamwork. So for instance, in diabetes, as GLG2s, because they've been shown to have prognostic benefit in heart failure, we try to persuade the diabetic team to use them. And they come and discuss with us, and tell us why we can't use this GLT2s."
"And similarly for airways disease, it used to be pretty straightforward. Our concern was, can we give them beta blockers or not? Because they'll value in heart failure, and we want to know whether they do or do not have reversibility. And that used to be the main interaction. But nowadays there's so many different types of inhalers, it's a bit more involved. And so we do work with them in choosing the best inhaler and drug, and to decide whether their breathlessness is due to the heart or due to the lungs. So we do work as a team in that sense. For instance, lung disease can cause pulmonary hypertension, which can affect the heart. Sometimes it's difficult to tease out whether it's the lungs, the pulmonary hypertension or the heart that's the main problem. So we do work as a team quite a lot as well."
"Well, I suppose high lipids is another one, because we work with our clinical biochemist. Because nowadays you've got the expensive drugs like PCSK9 inhibitors, and because they're expensive, she's the only one who's allowed to prescribe them, for instance. And the stroke team we work with, because quite often when we're talking about atrial fibrillation, they're wanting to know whether to anti-coagulate or not and whether the arrhythmia is important. And to lesser extent, we have interaction with the vascular surgeons. But I think that endocrinologists, diabetologists and pulmonary physicians are the main people we work with, in terms of comorbidity."
"Right. Yeah, that's a good question because it seems pretty random, whether the GP's referred them to us or to the respiratory physicians. So usually, like most things, the key thing is a good history, isn't it? So if someone refers breathlessness to us, we want to tease out whether there's any fluid overload or symptoms related to that, in case it's heart failure. And then we want to look for features of airways disease, diurnal variation and that sort of thing, or even whether it's angina equivalent."
"So sometimes it can be quite difficult, and you sometimes investigate for all these conditions at the same time, if the history is difficult. But sometimes for instance, if you think it's coronary disease and you get a CT scan, the CT scan may show that the arteries are okay but in fact the lungs are shot. So sometimes you get it wrong."
"But I think eventually we get there, and so if someone comes with breathlessness, I think we do get the right diagnosis in the majority of cases. And then if the test you request doesn't show what you think was the case, then you exclude all the other conditions that the history suggests. So they might have to investigate coronary disease and an echo to exclude heart failure, and then you end up doing pulmonary function tests. And that's not an uncommon scenario. I think the respiratory physicians, they do it the way other way round. A lot of their patients have pulmonary function tests first and then if it gives no clues, they then ask us to see whether it's a cardiac condition."
"Well, sometimes we do it at the same time, like I indicated earlier. But sometimes, we think it's cardiac and then it turns out it's not, and then we move on to respiratory investigations. I don't think we routinely investigate for all possible causes of breathlessness right at the beginning. We use the history to guide us. There are occasions when we might order all the tests right at the beginning, but I think that wouldn't be common."
"Well, it could be because they have got all three conditions. So if they're overweight and a smoker and they've got a history of sleep apnea, and they've got exertional symptoms but there's also diurnal variation, it could be that they've got all three, haven't they? Because some patients present late or relatively late, and because they're smokers, they may turn out to have heart failure, coronary disease and airways disease. So usually, as long we think there's a good chance of them having everything, or if we're completely stumped by the history because it's atypical and we're not sure what they've got."
"Oh yes. Oh yes. Oh, I do the simple tests myself. And of course, like I said earlier, nowadays we use CT coronary angiograms a lot, and sometimes that tells you the answer, doesn't it? Because it looks at the lungs as well. But if a patient has all the cardiac investigations and doesn't show anything, and the pulmonary function tests show nothing and they're still breathless, then because of the way... We can't refer directly to our colleagues, because it's a primary care thing, to save money. We ask the GPs to refer to the respiratory team."
"So if someone comes with breathlessness and they haven't got a cardiac condition, and we do simple tests like pulmonary function and they're normal, then we say, ""Why don't you refer to a respiratory physician for opinion?"" On the other hand, if after we've done the tests and we haven't got an answer, but the patient's very ill, then even though we're not supposed to refer to our respiratory colleagues ourselves, to save time, we break the rules and refer them directly anyway. Because it's not fair on the patients to wait for the GP to act."
Say that again. If they've got established cardiovascular disease...?
"All right. Yeah. So if a patient has lung disease, from my point of view, it might affect what drugs I'm able to use. Primarily, I suppose it's beta blockers, because if they've got airways disease, we might have to use something like ivabradine instead. And also if they've got lung disease, other drugs that we can't use may include amiodarone, for instance."
"And obviously if they've got lung disease, it may mean we can't operate on them and it may mean that sometimes we're not sure whether it's the lung or the heart that's the important thing, and we have to get our colleagues in to see what they think is the predominant problem, you see. Because sometimes some coronary disease may be coincidental and it's their lung disease that's the problem. Yeah. So people with lung disease affect this because it may affect what drugs we can or can't use, what operations they can have or not have, and it may make us puzzle as to which part of their body is the main problem, the heart or the lung."
"I think it's about 12 to 15 percent, I would say. Yeah. And of course, I suspect that obstructive sleep apnea is a bit underdiagnosed. And because I would say at least a third of our patients are overweight, I suspect there's quite a lot of obstructive sleep apnea that goes underneath the radar. But in terms of airways obstruction, I would say it's about 15 or so percent."
"Yes. That's a good question, isn't it? Because quite often we do reversibility studies, just to make sure that beta blockers are safe. Some cardiologists use nebivolol without doing pulmonary function tests because they think it's entirely safe from the airways point of view. But for myself, I always check pulmonary function, because we want to know how much reversibility there is. And when we do pulmonary function tests, I would say that a quarter of the airways disease probably have significant airways reversibility when you give them nebulized Ventolin during pulmonary function tests. So I think a quarter of our patients have significant airways reversibility when you test it formally with nebulized Ventolin."
Yeah. Or they've got a confirmed diagnosis already. I would say about a quarter of my patients. Yeah.
"Oh, no. 25 percent. So of the 15 percent that have airways obstruction, I think 25 percent have airways reversibility."
Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Something like that. Yeah. Whatever. Three quarters of them have true COPD. Yeah.
"The COPD? Well, it'll be the respiratory nurses. Yeah. Because everyone with COPD in our region gets referred to a respiratory nurse and nearly all GP practices have respiratory nurses as well, don't they? Asthma nurses and COPD nurses."
"Well, like I say, I think most GP practices in our area have got a COPD-asthma nurse. And in hospital, we've got quite a few of them. I don't know precisely how many, but I think it's at least five or six."
"Yeah. So the respiratory nurses, they've been delegated the task of picking the number and type of inhaler, haven't they? Because they work to regional guidelines, don't they? As to how to manage COPD. Yeah. So just like we have heart failure nurses, the respiratory doctors have respiratory nurses and they work to guidelines, just as our heart failure nurses work to guidelines."
"Well, I think the most common way it impacts our management is that if they've got airways reversibility or asthma, then we don't tend to use beta blockers and we have to use alternative drugs like ivabradine. And if they've got very bad lung disease, it may mean that we may be more likely to treat the cardiac condition from a symptomatic rather than the prognostic point of view. Because if someone's on home oxygen and got a poor prognosis, then from the cardiac point of view, there's not too much point on emphasizing the prognostic part of our treatment pathway and is more in the symptomatic and even the palliative part of our pathway. Yeah. So basically, it affects what type of drugs we use and how aggressively we treat them."
"And also, we want to make sure that their lung treatment is optimized as well, isn't it? Because sometimes it's difficult to tell whether the breathlessness is mainly due to one condition. And in fact, it's quite commonly more due to the heart and the lungs and to something else. And so you have to, from a symptomatic point of view, optimize their treatment."
"Well, I'm quite comfortable, in the sense that I can always refer them on, if you see what I mean. So for instance, if someone has got COPD, we always refer them on to the respiratory nurses because that's the pathway. And they go through their treatment pathway, and then if they get stuck or if they think there's a problem, then they'll escalate to the respiratory physicians, you see? So I think anyone with airways disease, we've referred them all, really, or almost all of them."
"So in that sense, we're happy because we've got help at hand."
"Oh, right. No. No, I don't think we would manage the COPD. So for instance, I wouldn't bring a patient back to clinic just to see how their COPD were and whether I should increase their inhalers or change their inhalers. No. No cardiologist would do that. They would always refer on, for that to be done. Yeah."
"And similarly, if a respiratory physician's looking after someone with heart failure, they wouldn't look after the heart failure side on their own. They would always refer to our heart failure nurses. I think it's gone that way now in every hospital in this country. I don't think you would find a cardiologist looking after COPD. And in fact, the training is so short and relatively specialized these days that the newer cardiologists can't even manage every cardiac condition. I can't imagine a consultant cardiologist, graduating in the past few years, wanting to look after COPD on their own. And they wouldn't, I don't think."
"Oh, if they have lots of exacerbations? Yeah, so obviously the group of patients who get admitted a lot, from a cardiac point view, are those patients with heart failure. And if they've got COPD as well, they're more likely to have even more hospital admissions because if they have a bad chest infection, then it affects their heart failure and they come in with both COPD and exacerbation of heart failure. And so we are concerned."
"In fact, a lot of these patients, they come in through the door and the junior doctors don't know whether it's the COPD or the heart failure that's important. They get started on antibiotics, diuretics and prednisolone, as a matter of course, don't they? That's been going on for years. So COPD is important because if patients have frequent exacerbations, it means they're more likely to come in with their heart failure as well. And sometimes-"
"Well, if they've got bad heart failure, if you have another problem, the heart is not able to cope with the additional stresses and their heart failure deteriorates and they come in with both problems. And that's very common."
"Well, chest infections can trigger off atrial fibrillation as well, can't it? And there's also so-called Type Two myocardial infarction, which means that if a patient with coronary disease catches a chest infection and it's bad, that might aggravate the angina. If you do the troponin test, they might actually have a heart attack. So a heart attack secondary to a chest infection would come under what we call Type Two myocardial infarction. It's a recognized clinical phenomena. So it does happen with other cardiovascular conditions, especially AF and acute coronary syndrome."
"Oh yeah. Oh yeah, of course. Of course. That's right. Yeah. Although I said earlier we wouldn't manage and follow them up on our own, if they're coming in with an exacerbation, then of course it's important to know all the reasons why that patient's come in. Yeah, so we obviously do ask. It could be infection. Could be a renal problem. So we do ask. And like I say, that's why we refer to our colleagues, because you've got to optimize the treatment of every condition, if you can, to prevent hospital admissions."
"But like I said earlier, some people, if their conditions are very bad, you might take a palliative approach and refer them to palliative care and say, ""Look, this patient shouldn't come back into hospital."" And if they get another episode of heart failure or COPD exacerbation, just try and make them comfortable. So of course we like to know what other problems they've got and how bad it is because we want to keep them out hospital, either by making them as well as they can, or by recognizing that the end is nigh and that we should keep them comfortable."
"I think the honest answer is, probably not. Obviously, we don't want them to be on steroids too long if they've got heart failure, because of fluid retention. But in terms of what inhalers to use, I don't think what type of cardiovascular condition they've got changes that. I suppose sometimes, in AF, a beta agonist might speed their heart rate up more or may be more likely to trigger AF. But I think in general, we're not too bothered about how the COPD is managed in terms of what drugs our respiratory colleagues use."
"Well, sometimes there's a common causative factor, isn't there? Smoking, for instance, is a common causative factor. So quite often, helping them stop smoking is important, with patches or gum or electronic cigarettes and that sort of thing. Yeah. What was the question again? I've forgotten. Sorry."
"Right. Well, it's recognized that chest infections often precede a heart attack or heart failure. And in fact, when I did research, part of it was looking into the role of chlamydia and other respiratory infections, you see? And I think the simple explanation is that you have an exacerbation, you have an increased metabolic requirement or cardiac output requirement. If your heart can't deliver it for whatever reason, then that's why you run into trouble and why patients come into hospital, you see? So I think that's the simple explanation for that."
"And of course there's more sophisticated explanations. To think that germs may actually end up on the plaques in the coronary arteries and may make the plaques more likely to rupture. There's research going on into that, for instance. Or went on in that, for instance. Yeah. But essentially, chest infections quite often precede cardiovascular exacerbations like heart failure, arrhythmias and heart attacks. That's right. So if you can prevent chest infections, if patients have antibiotics at home or if they're taught to recognize deterioration in their respiratory conditions, you might actually prevent cardiovascular admissions as well."
"Yes, I think it does, but I think it is more the way round. But for instance, if you've got fluid in your lungs, that can make you more disposed having chest infections, for instance. And obviously, if you've got low oxygen levels to begin with, and then you have added pulmonary edema on that, it's going to make your lung condition worse."
"But apart from that, I don't think angina impacts directly on COPD and I don't think AF or arrhythmias impact directly on COPD. But if you get fluid in the lungs, it can do. It can cause bronchoconstriction, can't it? And that's why sometimes, when people come in with pulmonary edema, you have to give them nebulizers as well sometimes. Yeah. But I think it's mainly the other way round."
"Yeah. Yes, that's right. Pulmonary hypertension, I think is under-recognized, which is why the reps for the pulmonary hypertension drugs, they go around teaching the echo technicians. And I happen to do the right heart cardiac catheterizations in our hospital, which is the way you diagnose pulmonary hypertension. And certainly over the past few years, people are more aware of it. They're more aware of it now because there are better treatments, I suppose. And pulmonary hypertension is another area where the lungs affect the heart."
"Any of the conditions where... Well, unless we give them beta blockers accidentally, or something like that. No, I think mainly it's the other way round, really. Yes. Yes."
"Or where... Oh, yeah. I reckon there's a lot of that. Yeah."
"Well, I don't think there are. Apart from optimizing their inhaler treatment, what is there that you can do? I'm not sure that there is, is there? Steroids make the heart worse, don't they? So I think we're a bit bereft of treatment options, once you've optimized their inhaler treatment. So I'm not sure that there's much we can do apart from inhalers and home oxygen if they need it, is there?"
"Unless you're talking about things like clearing their sputum and physiotherapy, if they've got bronchiectasis or emphysema or something like that, to make sure they don't have sputum in their lungs which makes them prone to infections. Unless you're talking about those approaches. But like I say, the respiratory nurses usually deal with that for us."
"No. Yes, I'm afraid from my point of view, although they change their inhalers, I don't often see much of an improvement, to be quite honest with you, for the ones with severe COPD. Yes. It's quite disappointing. I think in heart failure, we've got a lot more drugs now and I think we do make our patients better. But for patients with COPD, quite often I don't think they're made better."
"So, cardiac and cancer represents a substantial... So across four studies, up to 39 percent of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular causes and... Right. Okay. Well, it depends what the statements mean. So for instance, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in this country, isn't it? So if a patient has both COPD and cardiovascular disease, it wouldn't be a surprise to learn that the majority of deaths were due to a cardiac cause. It doesn't necessarily mean..."
"When they say ""COPD deaths"", what does that actually mean? Does it mean that a patient with COPD happened to have a cardiac condition and died, without saying whether the COPD or the cardiac condition was the cause of death? Or do they mean that their cardiac condition made their COPD worse and that's because they die. So how do they work that out? Because if someone dies, how do you know they died from the COPD or from the cardiac cause, or whether it was the COPD that made the cardiac cause worse or the cardiac cause made the COPD worse? It'd be very difficult to work that out, wouldn't it? Is that what they're saying? That these   00:38:19 ?"
"The way I would interpret this slide is that COPD... I would say that cardiovascular death is the most common cause of death in this country and therefore in COPD patients, it wouldn't be surprising if they died from a cardiac cause as well. So it wouldn't surprise me if 39 percent of patients with COPD actually died from a cardiac cause."
Yeah. Okay. Yes. I think that's what I'm trying to say. Sorry if it's long-winded.
"Yes. What they should do is to have a similar slide with patients without COPD and see what percentage of them died from a cardiovascular cause, you see? But anyway, I know what you mean. Thank you."
"Hmm. So individuals who COPD have a two time... Than those without COPD. I think that's a reasonable statement, because it might be due to a common causative factor such as smoking, you see? So I would believe that statement. Individuals with COPD. So increase of risk of mortality. First is COPD alone  inaudible 00:40:31  it's cardiac. So basically, increase  inaudible 00:40:40  factor versus COPD below 42 percent. They're quite broad ranges, aren't they?"
"I'm not quite sure... Is that saying that those two columns... So if someone's got both COPD and cardiovascular disease, then compared with COPD alone or cardiovascular disease alone, the mortality is increased? Yes. Yes. That's believable too. Yeah. So essentially, if you've got two conditions, you're more likely to die than if you've got one condition. I think that's what that's trying to say, isn't it?"
"Yeah. The more comorbidities you have, the more likely you are to be frail and to die. So I don't think this is specific to cardiovascular disease or COPD. I think   00:41:36 ."
"It's believable. Yeah, yeah. It's plausible. Yeah. Yeah. So these   00:41:43 ."
"Okay. Yes, that's right. The risk of cardiovascular complications is increased. That's right. Like I say, you can get Type Two heart attacks. Yes. Yes. So yes. Yes. These figures, I think are well known. Yes."
"It is. It is. That's right. You see, in the turn of the century, it was a hot topic that chlamydia was a cause of coronary disease. And I did a two year MD during that period. So this doesn't surprise me at all, but I am surprised that I am the first cardiologist to say this to you, because the concept of Type Two myocardial infarction is very common, and a common cause of Type Two myocardial infarction is chest infection. So I'm really surprised if cardiologists have said to you that they don't think that COPD exacerbation causes heart attack. Because every cardiologist will know what a Type Two myocardial infarction is, and we all know that a common cause of Type Two myocardial infarction is COPD exacerbation."
"Well, that's right. Well, it isn't. That's why it's called Type One and... A Type One heart attack is a blockage in a coronary artery so that the heart doesn't get blood, okay? A Type Two heart attack is where there's no blockage, but because there's so much more demand that the body, including the heart, doesn't get enough oxygen and the heart dies."
"But nevertheless, even though it's not a true heart attack, they know what a Type Two heart attack is and they know that infections cause them. So I'm surprised that I'm the first cardiologist who agrees with that statement. And I'm pretty certain that if you said to them, ""What about Type Two myocardial infarctions?"", they will all say, ""Oh, okay."""
"Because there's now five or six types of myocardial infarction, and I can't believe that there's any cardiologist who don't know that respiratory infections causes Type Twos. Because our registrars, when they're on call, it's quite common for them to see it and they always come to us saying, ""Do we need to do an angiogram?"" And we all say, ""No."" So I can't believe I'm the first cardiologist to say that."
"Okay. Well, oh yes, that's right. Well, that's right. In fact, there are papers suggesting there is a relationship between infection and Type One. But in clinical practice, Type Two is the most common. And although we don't treat Type Two the same way as Type One, it doesn't mean they're not important. Because if there's a large amount of muscle involved, that patient will still develop heart failure. So I think you might need to talk to more cardiologists. Have you talked to a lot?"
"Now, I've heard of an association between exacerbation and stroke, but I don't think is as big as the association between Type Two and COPD exacerbation. So for stroke, I've heard of it, but I don't think it's in the same order of magnitude as Type Two infarcts."
"And in fact, that's what that graph says, doesn't it? Because the risk of   00:46:07 -"
"Yes, I think so. It does to me, anyway. Right? Maybe I'm an outlier, but that looks okay to me. Yeah."
So what was the question? I missed it. Sorry.
"Yeah. The risk of... Yeah. Following a moderate... Yeah. No, I agree with this slide. Yeah."
"Just to make sure I'm looking at the correct slide, is it the one with the number three in the top right corner?"
Have you got a slide like this with heart failure?
There'd be less controversy if you put one up between COPD and exacerbation and heart failure.
"Well, I think the term ""moderate exacerbation"" is a bit nonspecific, isn't it? I'm not quite sure what that precisely means. But we do see these things with moderate exacerbation. Yeah. Let's see what it says. ""Moderate exacerbation was defined by prescription of oral steroids and prescription of pre-selected oral antibiotics."" I would say that the prescription of oral steroids and pre-selected oral antibiotics is entirely arbitrary, depending on which GP or junior doctor has seen them, and you can't use that to determine whether it is mild, moderate or severe."
"For a more precise definition, I would look at things like oxygen saturation or PO2 or inflammatory markers and things like that. But defining it by the use of steroids and or antibiotics just reflects the quality of the doctor seeing them, rather than the degree of exacerbation. So I think if you use that definition, it's harder to answer that question."
"Right. Okay. Well, let's have a look at the Y axis. So cumulative incidents of all cause... So the Y axis, is that three percent, is the top? Three percent is a pretty small number, isn't it? Is that right? Yeah. So after 52 weeks, which is a year, the difference between Product X and LABA/LAMA, which is the bigger difference, boils down to one point something percent absolute mortality difference. Is that right? Yeah."
"Yeah. Okay. Yeah. The relative risk reduction of 49 percent is actually big, but an absolute reduction of one percent... You have to treat a hundred people to save one life, basically, isn't it?"
"Yeah. Okay. Oh, okay. Okay. Yes, that's right. So it's a relatively high figure, but a relatively impressive relative risk reduction, isn't it? So some people will look at the number needed to treat in a year and say it's relatively high and they would want a cost analysis done, wouldn't they? Yeah. Yeah. So 49 percent is impressive but it's the relative risk number, and the absolute numbers are actually small. Yeah."
"They will definitely look for cost analysis, because if you have to treat 80 to save one life... For instance, if you've got heart failure, your risk of dying in a year nowadays is only eight percent anyway. I think it's about eight percent. Yeah, so I think they would want NICE to do a cost analysis. Yeah. I think that's right. Yeah. It's an impressive relative risk reduction though."
"Mind you, if you compare it to the ICS LABA... Oh, no. No, you're right. Sorry. Sorry. My mistake. Yeah, no, you're right. I've said all I wanted to say. Sorry."
"Yeah. You see, the Y axis, it's a small percentage, isn't it? So the difference between them, I think are relatively small, to be honest with you. Obviously the Y axis makes the differences look more impressive. But when you look at the actual figures, for instance, the first column is the difference between 1.5 and 2 point something, isn't it? It's just over half a patient, you see? So these differences are quite small. So I think they would want to see cost analysis, to see whether this is something that's worthwhile giving. Obviously, it's good that we're saving lives. But the numbers, I would say, are small. The absolute numbers are small."
"Yes. This is what this graph is saying, but it is saying that this new drug can only reverse it in a small way, can't it? Do you know what I mean? When you look at the peaks of the bars, all the differences are around half, aren't they? Or less. Half a percent."
"Right. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. So yes. So the competence into four is good, right? 62 percent relative risk sounds impressive. Once again, it boils down to the absolute numbers and yes, when you look at the absolute numbers, is actually not much. The number needed to treat, you don't show for the blue box. Well, I suspect it's 80 something, isn't it? 83, 84, something like that? Do you think? So the number needed to treat, I suspect, won't be much difference, even though there's a big difference in the relative risk. Do you have a number needed to treat in the blue box?"
"I see. Yes. Obviously, this slide is more useful because now we've got something proper to compare it to. Yeah. Everyone's raving about EMPA-REG at the moment, aren't they? So the number needed to treat was 119, was it? Which sounds a bit of a... Right, right. Well, when you do it this way, those trials, trial Y and trial X are more impressive when you present it this way. Because every cardiologist would know the significance of EMPA-REG, or at least they will know current hype surrounding EMPA-REG."
"And I suppose then it boils down to cost. So for instance, if you say that this drug is the same as empagliflozin, then someone looking at that curve will say, ""Okay, we'll use it then."" If they say it's a lot more expensive, then they might not. Yeah. But yeah, from your point of view, or from a marketing point of view, this puts it into context. Apart from fact it hasn't got the cost of the drug."
"So for instance, we've mentioned EMPA-REG drug. If we have a diabetic patient, we try to persuade our diabetologists to use dapagliflozin, which is a similar drug with equally compelling data. So essentially if we had this data for this new inhaler, and if NICE says it's as cost effective as dapagliflozin or empagliflozin, then we would be asking our respiratory colleagues to put them on it, just like we're asking our diabetic colleagues to use dapagliflozin."
"Oh, is it one that's currently available? Oh, yes. Sorry. It says there."
"I see. Oh yeah. Sorry. I missed that bit. It says ICS LABA/LAMA, doesn't it? Yeah. Sorry. Oh, I see. So it might already be available then, mightn't it?"
"Oh, I see. Oh, I see. Oh, okay then. Fair enough. Well, they've got dapagliflozin too, haven't they? So if they pitch it at the same price, yeah, I think they're probably onto a winner."
"Okay. First, can we just do the first legal thing? The interview are using premium rates mobile numbers. Are you on the mobile number that they've given you the 845 number?"
"Yeah. Yeah I know. So what happened is a formal complaint was put in about interview using scam numbers last night, because they're using scam numbers in the UK. So obviously you are not a scam person but I'm just checking you are a real agency. You're not a scam trying to get me to dial in and all that stuff."
You have to be careful because I was in ... I did one with ... interview did this all the time and then sometimes you get like a 50 pound mobile bill from it.
"It's not your fault. But then interview actually lie to you and say that it's all toll free. So I have to check, first of all, this is legitimate and you are aware that interview, because you're recording this, are lying and charging premium rate numbers in the UK."
"It's awful. They've been doing it for ages and they won't change and they think they can get away with it. And it's like, ""So you are paying me and then I have to pay half of it back to interview in charges."" It's just a shocking state of affairs, Mr. And Mrs. Interview. And I'm still waiting for you to call me back to discuss why you are defrauding people. That's for the recording for them. Yeah. It's awful."
"Yeah. I was ... I did one last night with a load of other doctors and we all just went mad because it was like 50 P a minute and we were watching it and then interview were going, ""No, no, no. We're not charging you. We're not charging you in the end."" We went, ""Yeah. You are. You're lying."" And so we all had to end it and I think they're going to have so many complaints. I don't think it's ABPI complaints, but may be actually. Yeah. Anyway, should we do today?"
That'll be difficult. I'll go off on a tangent like anything.
Tell them not to use the premium rate scam number that the interviews are putting   00:04:14 
Just frightening considering you guys have been using your mobiles.
Yeah. I'm an acute and respiratory consultant based in a large teaching hospital in the north of England. I do a lot of the acute side of things. So obviously like most people in the country I'm doing COVID at the moment. We're still seeing large volumes of admissions.
"So, but obviously in the day job, I'll see acute respiratory deteriorations to come into the front door, which is exacerbations of COPD."
"Well, it's exacerbations, isn't it? Basically, the whole point is to make the jump up. And we previously, we had all these A, B, C, D things."
"And we went into the new paradigm of having a LAMA-LABA and LAMA-LABA's reduce exacerbations, but now we're have a  inaudible 00:06:04  corticosteroid and ... okay. I'm not going to go into the history of how we change things. But obviously the people who've got the  inaudible 00:06:10  eosinophilic, we would be optimizing them because they were exacerbating. But now realistically two or more exacerbations or even one or more exacerbation of COPD requiring hospital admissions, triple therapy within inhale corticosteroid."
"Well, that's always been the mythical one because what is an exacerbation for going from   00:06:38 "
"So basically an exacerbation is a change in a day to day variation, which requires hospitalization or a healthcare visit. So moderate would be a healthcare visit with their GP."
Severe would be a healthcare visit into secondary care.
"It depends how the patient presents. Obviously the most important thing in the pandemic is to change the par paradigm of people's treatment. You don't want people to come back into hospital. You want to optimize them. So previously, we try and ... it's long way of describing it, but we would always, some people not me, would give half therapy, assuming the patient would come back a week later breathless. Now with shifting paradigm, we do not want people in hospital. We must optimize them. So I will start people on triple therapy as their first line. Okay. So it's choosing the right patients because, when you really speak to somebody, take a history, they're come in with a severe exacerbation of COPD. And actually when you go through it, they are having exacerbations of COPD, but they're access in healthcare in different ways, going walk in centers, emergency departments. So it's just taking a good history."
"Between that? Well, Trixeo doesn't exist yet because it's only just been released by AstraZeneca and they're marketing it on the mortality data, but because of the pandemic, they really haven't been able to launch it very well. So, that's Trixeo. And then you have Visviva. Again, very poorly launched. Trimbow is obviously the Trinity  inaudible 00:08:35 . It MDI, twice daily. It's standard therapy for patients. You can use it with a spacer and then obviously you've got the GSK product, which is Trelegy, which is a fantastic product, once daily. And that's the one that you want, an ease of use, once daily. Give it to the patients, they take ... forget about it afterwards. So you've got the three things. You've got Trixeo. Nobody knows what Trixeo is even though it's got ... it's a fantastic product. New technology inside an MDI kind of, and you've got obviously an Ellipta device and then you've got a standard MDI."
I differentiate on the frequency and the device that's given.
"Yep. Oh, it's Trixeo that we're talking about. AstraZeneca"
"I've already seen this because I went through the Trixeo launch event in the UK because, obviously, a couple of months ago they launched it in the UK and there's the slide deck is out as well in the wild."
"It's been sent round to all the doctors. So it's slightly different to the slide deck. And there's also a voiceover with a UK voice as opposed to an American voice. A hell of a lot better. And they've lost the slides at the end because, obviously, it's the Aerosphere with the technology inside. So from the slide deck that's been sent round and they've done a couple of webinars on this. They have little ambulances going across the screen, which they've lost. So it looks good. It's good, but there's a couple of messages which are different in this."
"Basically they issued a standard slide deck, which has been sent out to all doctors and you're going, ""Bloody hell."" So I've got this in my inbox and I delivered this to GPs and it's like bloody hell. Okay. Carry on."
"Well, this one is purely, they're just saying exacerbations. Okay. So they've lost ... I won't go into it, but they've lost a little bit of the message, but its exacerbation equals mortality."
That's their market. Entire marketing campaign is reduction of mortality.
"Yeah. Because it's the first one that's got any data. So you've got Kronos and you got Ethos. Okay. And obviously, it's from the studies of Kronos and Ethos and we've seen them. Remember, forget the pulmonologist are chest physicians that we're called. We've seen all the data before. So this is a slide deck more for GPs. So yeah. It resonates with us. Well, we know that you have a stepwise change in somebody's lung function, post exacerbation. We know that you have a mortality and this is the first product, which actually has the bold claim to improve mortality. So it's the first marketing campaign, which is bold enough to say we reduce mortality. So for us as the clinicians, it's a good marketing message and we like it. It resonates well."
"Well, the trouble with Trixeo is I can't prescribe it because I haven't got the actual inhalers inside my hands. So this is being released a few months ago, but because of the pandemic, they haven't got the devices out."
"The reason because you've got mortality benefit. It's in a mortality benefit. So you've got mortality benefit, which is a claim above and beyond the other two agents. I've still got an MDI. Some people like to use a twice daily regime. So I's be ... my group that I've got on the Trelegy ... sorry on the Trimbow, the MDI version. I would be using that type of patient. I would be happy to transfer on mass over to all AstraZeneca product because you've got the mortality side of things. Now, the people that I'm using once daily, I'm using it more as the delivery device and the frequency. So okay. At present, I would probably have my once daily group on my twice to daily group because its different factors inside my head about which one used, but it resonates high from MDI twice daily to a twice daily."
"It doesn't have my lovely little ambulance on there to help me read my way through. And it's saying things in a little bit, too much of an American way. So it's like it increases the urgency to treat. Yes."
"No, not on the way that was delivered. No."
"Because it's not referencing the studies. It has to reference the data used at Kronos and the Ethos studies because you just chucked it in. And there's just suddenly the woman said Kronos, like we haven't referenced Kronos. If I'd never, if I didn't know my data, where does Kronos come from?"
"So you've just gone jumped into something as if, yes, I do know it, but my colleagues don't know it. So it's not set the scene that we are the first people to show that we have this data from this program, because it's a program. Ethos and Kronos is a program of studies that show that we have this. So you've just gone, ""We've got it."" And reference Kronos. Who's Kronos?"
"He's a titan. Yeah. So the way that we delivered, they didn't give me the data. You're supposed to tell, ""Okay. Here's the data. Here's the study. This is this. This is the message."""
"Yeah, it was still you've got mortality. You've got-"
Yes. It takes because you've got the mortality that the others don't. Yeah.
Yeah. It sticks because you've got mortality.
"Basically, powerful production against hospitalization. Okay. Now only Trixeo significantly reduces hospitalizations versus ICS-LABA. No, it doesn't. There are other ones, but can be on the graph I've got in front of me. I've got a LAMA-LABA and ICS and I've got the three together and you reduce exacerbations. Fine. I'm happy with that."
"Because you haven't got the one ... on the one previous, you've got a non-significant thing and because the two graphs are overlapping each other. So when you're looking at you're going, ""Oh, bugger. Little bit too, too much."" There's three bar charts. I've got to look at it quickly. So this one always better and reduction hospitalization 20%. Fantastic. Okay. And you go one hospitalization for every 31. Thank you. Thank you. That's just helps me conceptualize things."
"Yeah. Well now you're comparing because it's again, this is for me ... I know in the history you have the LAMA-LABA reduction. Okay. And then you've obviously always had the ICS-LABA reduction and it's two different treatment regimes and you're just comparing. You've got a triple, which is better than an ICS lacking component, lacking treatment. And then it's still better because you've added in the LABA into the ICS. Sorry. The LAMA into the ICS-LABA. My explanation is confusing for you. So when somebody's a non-chest physician looks at it'll go, ""Well, what does that really mean?"" So the one thing, if you've got the 20% reduction versus ICS-LABA, one in 31, good. Happy. Okay. I prefer the other one. Yep."
When it's the big number it's ... but it's not comparing the same thing.
Yeah. And then you've got the graphs on the other side and then you've put in Breztri and have a go. What the hell's Breztri?
"Yeah. One way they've changed the name of the thing at the bottom because Breztri's actually Trixeo. Yeah. So you can see that in there and yeah. And again, because the three graphs, it's just a little bit too difficult to understand what it means. And then the one visual with the one thing coming down, a lot easier, and that one in 31 means more to me."
"Because this is the mechanism of how the disease works because, yes, there was evidence from ... I'm not going to go for all the studies basically, but came from the  Novata 00:25:24  studies about LAMA-LABA class effect reduce exacerbations. But we've always known as the ICS combination, which is the better one. So 64 sounds great. But I know it's just you are playing on the person's lack of knowledge of what's going on. So for me as the specialist, the 20%, I'm happy with, it's a meaningful thing compared to an ICS, to another ICS campaign regime."
"But there's ... yeah. No. And the other one, you've got the same graph on there and I don't like the graph and that's a no."
"Because they're putting the biggest number possible down there to try and fool me and it's like, ""Forget that. I'm not that stupid. Give me the real thing."" One hospitalization for every 31 patients. I'm happy with that. Yeah."
"Oh, it'll be HA because you've got the one in 30 ... you've got the one in 31."
"Oh, so the second one will be HB and the third one will be HC and the fourth one will be original."
"It wouldn't actually. It'd still be one, two, three, four."
"Now, because we're talking about hospitalizations, it does not differentiate. That's the whole thing. It doesn't differentiate. And so there would be the same across. So I'd go 3.5. I know I can't. So just put four across, it just doesn't help differentiate this idea of exacerbation. Fine. That's the same for all of them."
"Yeah, it'd be the same. Oh God. Yes. It's the same ranking. Yeah. One, two, three, four."
"Yeah. I would like it to be better, obviously, a hell of a lot better, but no. I have accept that because if you ... to save one, if to do one PCI, you save one in 33 patients and we do a lot of PCIs, which is the percutaneous interventions inside somebody's heart. So a one to 30 isn't that bad compared to what we do."
"Yeah. Everyone says we are the only one ... Trixeo's the only one that has the ... is the only one that they're pushing on the mortality data. But if you look at the data for everybody, they've all got a little bit of a mortality signal. Okay. They've all done, definitely got reduction in exacerbations and hospitalizations. They have all got that data, but it's how they present their marketing. So it's everyone present reduces exacerbations, be it LAMA-LABA class effect, LABA ICS triple therapy class effect. We know that. And by saying something, which everybody else has got you going, ""Come on."" You've got the mortality. I'm so happy you've been brave enough to go down the mortality thing. That resonates a lot with me. Don't try and get everything."
"Even significantly more that's the whole thing. That wild claim, it won't stick. So it just says it don't ... it does significantly reduce hospitalization. Thank you. It does."
"Well, then you need to give me ... you need to go in to give me a study and then you need to give me the numbers to treat versus it's ... so it's an analogy of once there was a marketing campaign about, you have to treat somebody with one product for 600 years. So they reduced the amount of time that they have one pneumonia. Because when you did the maths, it was astronomical. So if you did the math, you have to treat the person with Trixeo versus X 100 people with another agent to save one hospitalization. And then when you do those maths, the ... someone always does it in the background. So these claims, for me, I find it's just ... it's a play on words and   00:31:19  Yeah."
Yeah. So it's all cause mortality. So there's a big story about all cause mortality and different agents and different claims that have been going back over more than a decade. But this is the first one. All reduction. Fine. All cause mortality. Yeah.
"Yeah, no again, because it's a big number, but obviously, big number is related by relative risk reduction, blah blah blah. The actual numbers are different, but one death presented for every 80 then you see ... okay. I probably wouldn't put one in 80 because it's not that great. But fine. Yeah. That's the whole point of Trixeo is that you have a reduction in mortality. Happy."
"I probably wouldn't ... one in 80, I probably wouldn't put in."
Great. It's that's not that great really? Is it?
"Well, just for the recordings, obviously a 49% reduction in death means that you've gone from a 2% death to a 1% death. That's a 49%. That's 50%, it's a relative risk reduction. So that's the whole thing with math. Or you might have gone down from 0.5 to 0.25% still very, very low death. So it's 49% relative risk reduction looks fantastic, but that's not the maths. And then when you actually do the one treated, so one death per 80, that's not, I wouldn't make any mass switch for that claim because you, looking at these are the factors within that compliant delivery, the delivery device itself."
"The molecules. So the patient factors about how something is delivered outweighs that 80. It's not good enough and obviously 49% reduction, everybody in the audience will go, well you went from 2% to 1% or 0.5 to 0.25 or 0.25 to 0.125. So it's ... yeah."
"Yeah. Well, because I understand you've got to put the 49% rate percent rate reduction. So I need to then look at the numbers, find one additional life. It's still not great, 80."
"Bit better because this is the bit that I need to see. Yeah. So I can get my idea around because it's a bold claim and it's telling me something and I've not seen this before the way they present it, because it's obviously related to the heart studies."
"No, it's a difficult ... the additional slide was the one I'd spend a lot more time looking at it. So the original."
"So the improvement on the original, B? No. C? No."
"Supplemental slide? No, the supplement ... I need the supplemental slide in and then the survival Kaplan Meier curves, or time to all cause mortality. I'm not going to bother to educate myself what that means."
"I'm never going to doing that. The 49% reduction death, that is the big thing. Yep."
That's the master thing. So it's just the information on top of that so I can understand how you got to it.
Oh no. MC doesn't. No. Right. It's the original that I like. Yeah.
"It'll be one ... it's one, two, three across the screen."
"And motivate, one, two, three across the screen. Differentiates from other therapies, one, two across the screen."
"That's exactly why I exist. Yep. So, the whole point in exacerbation is bad."
"When people exacerbate, they die quickly and you have other ... it's not just the respiratory, it's the other causes of death."
"So in exacerbation, we always call it's core from optimization. so yeah. That's why I exist as an acute respiratory physician."
"Not the same. Just one exacerbation. 21%. One in five, miocard infarction times two. Oh, that's still the original."
That's fine. I thought it was just some kind of intelligence test.
Yeah. I've got UA in front of me too. It's not better in the first because the way it doesn't flow as nicely because it just flows like a mission statement across the ... just across and it is 21%. One in five and you get the mortality. Yep. So this doesn't improve the initial.
"Yeah. It's a good concept. But the other one is just short, sharp, 21%, one in five, death. And then we're adding in these things because I know that an exacerbation causes declining lung function. I know that. And this is the first one that has the mortality side and now we're going into anxiety and depression and all the other things and it's not diluting down the message, but it's taken away from the mortality."
"Yeah. It's the standard little swirly thing that we see with all the COPD ones. It could any COPD product has this down on it. Any of them, all of them have had this on it and it's ... yeah, I understand what it means and it is good. It is good. But it's the same graphic on every single slide deck apart from MI Risk."
"So improvement on the original. No, no, no."
"And I'm just trying to think. Second. Yeah, I just go one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four."
"Compared to LAMA-LABA, you reduce exacerbations, but not compared to ICS-LABA. And that's always been that little bit with the P thing coming across. Yep."
"Yeah. Again, because you notice the one where you've got the nonsignificant thing on it always worries me. Yeah. But you've got 52%. It's better than the ICS added into the LAMA-LABA combination or however you want to present it. Yeah. Reduces exacerbations. I'm happy. Yep."
"Yeah. Because now you getting the decent NNT. Yep. So suddenly you've got a nice, proper big number and you go 52%, you've got down 0.95 to 0.46. We know exactly what it is. It's going down. So all the maths side of things in my brain is gone. Obviously it's just making sure that I know they keep putting Breztri and Trixeo intertwined and ... but yes, one in three. Fantastic. Good."
"Yeah, no. This is good because 52% reduction in moderate exacerbations is good. There's a good number. But the slide after is the best way of presenting it. It shows me what the reduction is and it gives me a number to treat."
"Oh, sorry. Prevent exacerbation versus LAMA-LABA of 50. It's not only Trixeo because all of them ... oh god. All of your competitors have made this statement, when they've added in ICS. I'm trying to pull out the back of my brain from the GSK product. There was a study that they ... when they added in the ICS to the ICS-LABA, it reduced exacerbations."
"Yeah. But number needs a treat of 80. I'll go, well I'm not interested. And number needs a treat of 30. I'll probably buy it. Yeah."
I wouldn't. I wouldn't because it's not ... it would actually put me off it more than anything else. But ... yep.
"This is easy. So the improvement, E seasons improvement, EA is not an improvement. Oh, it is an improvement over the original actually."
"Yeah. Oh it is that bar chart and it's the idea because on one side it says nonsignificant and the other side says significant. So it's just better than the bar charts. Yeah. And the big ... the numbers are good, but obviously the best way is EC. Far, far the best."
"So it'll be the opposite rank. It'll be going three, two, one."
"The one in 80. So the whole thing is that you can't mark it on one in 80, because it doesn't mean anything. It's meaningless. It's not good enough. It's meaningless because there's too many factors in why the patient ... the best inhaler is the patient ... is the device that goes in the patient's mouth."
"Okay. Then, but saying, saying I have to give 80 people. This half of them won't like it. So I should have used something else. And it's an idea that every life matters to loved ones. Yeah. But I'll actually be giving them better quality of life by giving them an inhaler they can actually use. Okay. So it's one in 80 doesn't change my idea that I get the best inhaler that the patient will take. It doesn't change that paradigm. And I'm trying to think, where do I start shifting?"
"It is rather than one in 30 mark. One in 30 mark, I'm starting to shift. Yeah. I'm pretty going to be invested in this. But remember it's not one additional life that you're saving. People with COPD have a trajectory where the next five years they will have a high mortality. So I'm not saying it's like an, ""I give you a statin and you either dropped over the heart attack or you don't dropped over a heart attack."" What you're really saying is, during the time of this study, you have to treat 80 people to save one life within this study period. But I also know that all of these patients, as they go through the trajectory, will have a very high mortality over five years. So it's ... yes. It is good. It is good, but don't try and over egg it. It's one in 80."
"So if you're trying and over egg it, that's a good thing. When I know all the confounding factors of using an inhaler and people are going to pass away anyway, it's not good. If it was one in three, I'd be ... oh my god. I've got to   00:48:45  everybody now."
"No ones actually told us what Kronos is. What was it? Where was it? What was it against? And yeah. And then how was it done? But in Kronos, the majority of patients did have a history of exacerbations within the last year. Good. Just telling me the exacerbate. What the patient population was and you reduced the exacerbations in the LAMA-LABA group. Good. Yep."
"And then this thing, did you know that one in two exacerbations go unreported? Yeah, I did, but that's such an important message. Yeah."
So yeah. So they're saying that people in Kronos weren't exacerbators. That's what it's telling me I think.
"And then they didn't exacerbate. I think what they should be telling me is okay. They were non exacerbators. I've put them on this. I'm going, but why are they on this, if they're non exacerbator? Okay. Let's have a look at it and then go onto the other side. Reduces the exacerbations versus LAMA-LABA even in patients without a reason exacerbation. So a need has overall population 52%. Again, I need to know the numbers. Prior exacerbation. Okay. So it's kind of saying the same thing. I would then ask the rep, just tease out for me because I would not use a triple therapy in this group anyway. It wouldn't be on my guidelines. Definitely it wouldn't be on any of the guidelines and the NHS guidelines. So okay. Break it down for me. How many people who are non exacerbators do I need to treat to stop one exacerbation?"
"Yeah. Because it's that play on words. So it's a good thing. It's a good message. But I'm just going, ""Oh bugger."" Well, if they're non exacerbator, I'd never would have used the medication on them in the first place."
"I think even though I hate these graphs, they'll have to be this one. Because did you know that one into exacerbations go and reported?"
"So is this whole idea that then I'm going, ""Now you're confronting my idea that I had non exacerbators but they really weren't non exacerbators. They were, but they just hadn't reported them. So it ... yeah. I'm happy with that one. So number one first. Yeah."
"I'm just smiling because I did the launch event for Trixeo in the Northwest. I'm just smiling. So out of these slide decks, the first one I'd put is the one that goes across and it says exacerbations one in five mortality. That's where you start. So you start the story with that one that just goes straight across the screen because that's the one that gets you. Yeah. And then, so it's ... that's the mission statement and it's the idea and exacerbation causes damage. Okay."
"So you can talk around exacerbation does damage. And then the idea that one in five die within X amount of time and there's ... we all know that. We don't talk about it, but there's a lot of data about people passing away. And then we've got the idea of the mortality benefit and it's dying in an exacerbation, especially in COVID time, is a bad thing and we should treat them before they exacerbate. We don't need to wait for somebody to come into hospital before we optimize them. So an exacerbation is a call for optimization. That mission statement's gone. We need to optimize any time we interact with a COPD patient, our duty is to optimize them. Yeah."
"And you go with one, two, three and it's about optimization."
"To build. So I'd start off with talking about that slide that goes across 21% hospitalization, one in five, and the mortality stuff. And okay. You can't talk about the history of how we got to this point."
"You can't talk about that, but then it's going in into what is the data, the Kronos and the Ethos, and then teasing out what is done and what is compared to what and explaining the numbers to treat in the different areas. So, MNT and ... If I start off with an NNT of one in three, I've grabbed somebody's attention immediately. And then after that I could go to an NNTR 30 because they ... it's fine. It's a massive, massive improvement. So, and then I can go down. I probably wouldn't go into an NNT of one in 80, but it's the idea is I have a product. There's different agents."
"You have to think of the patient and what's best to the patient. However, when you're comparing a Ferrari and a Ferrari, and one of them reduces ... well, it's not Ferrari. It's a Fiat and a Fiat, and one reduces mortality. You have to use it. You can't not use it. When you are using the same thing for a patient and, basically, that's where you go directly against Trimbow. You go against Trimbow. What's different about these two things? Same thing. You've now got a mortality. Look at this. I've got mortality improvement. Look at this. This company said mortality improvement, have a look at the data, but then I gave a little bit through the Kronos and Ethos but Kronos."
"I think the biggest problem with Trixeo is because it was launched not it's exactly same as Visviva, but launched, but not launched. Trixeo launched, but not launched. And it's out there. It's in the wild. It's been launched and we're going through the slide decks again to try and get the message. And it's like, ""Oh god, AZ."" I know you need to do it, but you the strike when the iron's hot."
"It's been launched. Trixeo's been launched. It's launched, but not launched. It's like Visviva was launched, but not launched. Because of COVID everyone's forgotten. We want education. We want new things. We want to think about something instead of the thousands of COVID patients, we've just dealt with. We are hungry as a population of doctors. We are hungry for education. We are hungry for meetings. We are hungry to hear something different, something positive, and anything which mortality gets better is ... what we've been through is ... oh my god. I can actually make people better for once. So and fine. I know COVID has changed a lot and changed the landscape, but it is the reps aren't in the hospitals anymore. AstraZeneca let of their local reps go redundant and everything. And you're going, ""Come on."" One of the biggest AstraZeneca, you've saved the world with the vaccine, but you've just not given ... you promised me the Trixeo for such a long time."
"And it's like just falling through my hands. I like the product. Obviously the Aerosphere slide has to be in there. Has to be in there to talk about the device and the actual coaching of the particles. I love all that stuff. But by the time they've got themselves out telling everybody about it, nobody wants to listen to my message. Nobody will want to listen to this. Nobody will want to prescribe it. No GP will want to make a change. And none of my colleagues will be interested because we'll have moved on. And it's like the LAMA-LABA spent all those years coming up with its name, but never really pushed it out there. I"
"We've had this silly thing of extra fine particle deposition trademark. It's a trademark. It's a construction of words, which tells you nothing about extra fine going into the lungs. But in this case, I used it as a marketing campaign. It's a trademark. Then you've got a company that you bought the company from somewhere else. I'm not going to go into its name, but then you bought it and you coated the particles and they go in and it just good. And just talk about the science and for me a geek, the inhaler device is different enough. It is not an MDI. It is not a twice daily MDI, brown inhaler, boring thing. It's a brand new thing, the technology inside it. So it's having the slide, have the picture of the actual chamber, the mixing, the flow. It is new. Yeah."
"Yeah, I'm a pulmonologist consultant, large district general hospital, NHS, North of England."
"So, it depends really on the phenotype of the patient. So, to be on triple therapy, ideally, they need to be eosinophilic. So, it counts of above 0.15 to 0.3, depending on the cutoff, be exacerbating and obviously have COPD diagnosis. Or, currently, there's a couple of them, triples license for asthma. But this is a COP talk, so have a COPD diagnosis."
"I guess, a moderate exacerbation is something requiring intervention. For example, steroids under antibiotics. Severe exacerbation to me would be something that necessitates an A&E attendance or an omission to hospital."
"I, for many years, have used LAMA/LABA together even before combined LAMA/LABAs existed. So, I used to give everyone with COPD, tiotropium,  inaudible 00:03:44  was first released. So, a separate LABA and LAMA because it didn't make sense to do single bronchodilation when there were two receptors available. So, I've got no problem starting people on combined bronchodilators. And if they've got eosinophilia, as I said, I'll just give them a triple even if they've not been on an inhaler before. I've got no issue doing that. I don't really mind what the spirometry is. I know some of the inhalers have specific licenses in terms of FEV1. But, to me, if they've got symptoms and they've got the right fit  inaudible 00:04:18  type wise, I'll use it first line and whatever the FEV1."
"Well, I guess mainly device. But also, to a degree, molecules, and then inhaler type as well and frequency of use. So, the ones that are there are for COPD is GSK's TRELEGY and then once a day Lipson device. That's the dry powder. Chiesi's Trimbow in an MDI and then there's AZ's Trixeo now."
"Which is, I guess, very similar to Trimbow, except the molecules are slightly different. But the same sort of device, MDI, aerosol."
"I don't honestly think... I know the companies and reps will say there're differences. I don't think there's a huge amount of difference between the different inhalers. At the moment, guidance is that, in general, try and use a dry powder inhaler over an aerosol for environmental reasons. So, really, unless there's a reason, we will probably use GSK's TRELEGY first, simply because it's a dry powder. At the moment, Chiesi's don't have the Trimbow inhaler as a  inaudible 00:06:15  but I think that may be coming. And obviously, AZs is Trixeo, only on MDI. So, that's the main difference of why we would use it. In terms of respiratory flow, some people are not able to take full deep breaths, which, I guess, is really ideally needed for a dry powder. So, coupling the Trimbow inhaler onto an AeroChamber can benefit patients who have low inspiratory volumes because they can breathe in and out through the AeroChamber because it's got a one way valve on it."
"I mean, it's pretty clear. It's giving reasons why it's beneficial over LABA/LAMAs and ICS/LABAs in terms of reducing mortality by 50 odd percent and hospitalizations by up to 20% compared with an ICS/LABA. It's talking about, if you do go into hospital, you're at risk of dying, 20% risk of death and two times risk of heart attack. I mean, it's not new to me. I know going into hospital with COPD is bad. I don't think it's quite as simple as what it's made out in that these inhalers all have ICS in it and that there is a theoretical risk of pneumonia with those types of inhalers and trying to select the right patient is also important. So, I guess going back to what I said right near at the start, it actually also depends to degree on the eosinophil count and whether they're eosinophilic or non-eosinophilic is whether they do or don't get triple inhalers therapy."
"It hasn't because I've been doing respiratory medicine for 20 years. So, I know what the risk is. Going back to the TORCH study for Seretide many, many years ago."
"Well, mortality in COPD inhalers is a longstanding thing. Again, going back to TORCH, there was a famously didn't achieve a significant reduction in mortality for Seretide at that point. So, that's been the holy grail. To claim mortality is quite a big thing for inhalers in COPD and I know Trixeo have done that. One of the p-values was not significant in some of the numbers given. I can't remember... It may have been on the second by last slide. But I know they're claiming reduction in mortality, but the numbers are actually quite small. 1.4 versus 2.6 is not a huge amount and the potential adverse effects like pneumonia haven't been quoted either. So, if you just give everyone ICS/LABA or triples, there is a... Independent of the inhaler is a small risk of pneumonia as well. So, there's balance to be had."
"Well, it works, obviously. I didn't think it didn't work. The problem I have with Trixeo  inaudible 00:14:56  which is the first LABA/LAMA MDI, is that it's matched against an established treatment already which is Trimbow. And I don't see there's a massive advantage over that which is already on our formulary and being used and obviously has within it, the family of Foster as well. The main thing it'll be up against is Trimbow in terms of a direct competitor, but again, the dry powder alternative, which we're encouraged through guidance. I think NICE guidance is to use a dry powder where possible."
"It doesn't because, as I said before, I, to a degree, ignore product licensing. And you can use it in milder disease if they fit that pattern independent of the allowed FEV1 or the license FEV1. So, I use inhalers based on phenotype rather than within strict license if I think it's right for the patient."
"For me, you don't, because I use it.. I've just said to you, I start it on treatment, I use patients with milder disease. I've been using it for years and, like I said, even when there wasn't a LABA/LAMA, I created my own. So, I like to think I'm, not ahead of the game, but I don't need a lot of convincing to use triple inhalers."
"Well, I guess the big thing they're playing on with Trixeo at the moment is the mortality data. The GSK people, they concentrate on the environmental benefits and some real world data. Chiesi, what do they talk about? Just exacerbation reduction really rather than particularly hospitalization and mortality."
"The Tetralogy people have a new study. It begins with I. I'm trying to think of it off the top of my head. I can't remember it, the name. But essentially, it's exacerbation data and... I'm trying to think. I don't think it's mortality. But, yeah, at the moment, the big thing they're going on about is environmental and why you should use a dry powder first. The other thing they use, Tetralogy go on about is the ease of use of the inhaler in terms of 90 whatever percent of patients that used it, used it accurately. So, that's another reason to prescribe that."
Four because I don't think it's particularly told me that much new.
"Well, obviously, compared with different inhaler types that we still use, Trixeo has a better or a greater reduction in exacerbations. But the Y axis is quite important. You're talking about an average annual rate or reduction of a severe exacerbation as just under one, even for a LABA/LAMA. Which, I know it's not nothing, but it's not a huge amount either. And again, I know it's a severe exacerbation, so presumably hospitalized, but you're halving it from once a year to once every other year. Which is obviously a cost saving and important to the patient, but the difference, for instance, between an ICS-LABA and Trixeo, is actually not that much. It's one severe exacerbation every 10 years. Which, if you say it like that, is not a huge amount. It's 0.56 to 0.46. Which is, as I said, one exacerbation every 10 years. So, percentage reductions are only as good as the numbers behind them."
"It's trying to differentiate between other competitors. But, having said that, it's then directly comparing, not Trimbow or Tetralogy, it's comparing a LABA/LAMA. So, you're not comparing like with like. And I know they're not deliberately saying that, but the big lack of information that I need to make a decision to interpret this is whether these apply across the board or in patients who've just had significant eosinophilia or who not. Because if they have significant eosinophilia, trying to compare it with a LABA/LAMA is not valid."
"Again... It's the same data in a different way but reduction from one exacerbation per year to half a exacerbation a year and that's a 50% reduction. But again, you're not comparing like with like. So, what I would need to know to work out whether this is a load of rubbish or whether it's actually a genuine advantage is know that patient population and whether they were or weren't eosinophilic. Because if they were eosinophilic, I wouldn't treat a patient with a LABA/LAMA. So, it's not a valid comparison. I would treat them with either an ICS/LABA or, more realistically, triple inhaler therapy. And then you're talking about comparison between Trixeo and either Trimbow or Tetralogy and no one's done that. I suspect the difference won't be that much."
"The one on the right is because it's a much... That lays it out in black and white. Prevent one severe moderate exacerbation for every three patients versus a LABA/LAMA. So, I think that's more impactful than the one on the left because that takes quite a lot of looking at, right down to a tiny p-value. So, I think three humans personalizes it more."
"Well, yes and no, in that there's a lot of different fonts at the top."
I prefer the graph to that arrow down and 52% because there's a lot of small print all around it. The graph tells me that in a much more pictorial form.
"No, I don't think it is. As I said, I think it over complicates it."
"I think that is an improvement. Again, because of the humanized factor of it and, again, the data's presented in a graph form rather than text."
"I know there is text in it, obviously, but-"
"As I said, for the reasons I said, I don't think it does. But if you're making me choose it, then I'll choose original as one, EA for two and EC for three."
"Again, there's a reduction in hospitalizations, but again, the numbers are tiny. 0.16 severe exacerbation to 0.13. And again, that sounds like a significant reduction but it's tiny in terms of numbers. And if you look at n number below, actually the numbers are very meaningful and the p-values as well are... Well, one's not significant and one's borderline significant. Well, it's borderline significant, yeah. The actual number's 2120 versus 2137 are not in my mind really clinically significant."
"I think this makes it potentially even less impactful because it spells out that 0.13 versus 0.16 in terms of actual patients and to treat 31 patients is actually quite a lot. So, if you've just said also in the same slides earlier that it's a 20% reduction in mortality, that's like saying you have to treat 150 patients with Trixeo to potentially prevent one death. You're talking about pneumonia percents of one or two percent, then potentially that's... You're actually maybe causing more harm than good. So, it's all to be balanced."
"Yeah, no worries. So, this is now referencing two studies, comparing LABA/LAMA and ICS-LABA. Again, like I said, if they've got eosinophilia or reason to be on an ICS-LABA, the difference is not that much. I suspect if you switched someone from a LABA/LAMA to an ICS-LABA, you would do almost as well as a triple. Not quite, obviously, but almost as well. So, the direct comparison with a LABA/LAMA is not... I don't think it's valid in real world. I know all the p-values are good and 64% is good but it's... I prefer this slide in terms of presenting the data because it's more visually impactful but once you start reading the print below it, it actually doesn't mean a lot."
"Okay. So, again, the changing the big headline to with 20% reduction is quite impactful. I quite like how that's been presented. The graph on the right just takes away from that 20% slightly. Just one second, I'm just slightly confused. Because, on the left, it says 20% versus ICS-LABA. And then, on the right one... If you've got the middle black bar, it says 20% in reduction versus LABA/LAMA."
"Whereas, 23% on ICS-LABA on the left of the screen, it's 20% versus ICS-LABA. So, the numbers... I don't know if they're mixed up."
"Again, it's presenting similar sorts of data. It does say that there's a benefit of giving a triple over both subtypes of LABA/LAMA and ICS-LABA. Which, again, I would expect, but it just spells it out if you like. But again, the numbers, the actual numbers, are not massively different."
"HB, two. HC, three. And original, H four."
"No, not particularly. But I'll say, HB, one. HA, two. HC, three and original four."
"Well, it's quite a complicated graph. But just reading the 49 and 28 percent, I'll take away that that's a significant reduction in mortality just reading the percent but then there's a lot of small print and it's a black and white slide. So, you've got different shades of gray and it's relatively difficult to tell the two grays apart from the black. I can do it but it just makes you stop and it just adds extra delay to something that's supposed to be visually impactful."
"Okay, I think you've lost the benefit of a graph there. So, I think that's slightly worse but there you have one death can be prevented for every 80 patients. That's worse than before but that's a LABA/LAMA. Those sort of graphs are quite famous in medical papers and any significant drop with a percent by it is quite impactful. Obviously, you need to understand the data but those graphs are quite visually impactful, so I think this is worse."
"No, because there's a lot of patients that are treated with Trixeo."
"Again, the  inaudible 00:36:11  survival curves. So, again, they suggest that there's a significant reduction in mortality but I'm just... Again, if you look at the scale, it's quite ridiculous. It's 99 each... They've skewed the scale from... It makes it look quite impactful but actually you're talking about half or a quarter of a percent. So, that y scale is very misleading."
"Okay. This is the old comparison with heart disease trials. Again, a similar statin 4S trial was quite famous for being the first study really that showed quite a significant reduction with a statin. So, they're trying to say that it's... I'm trying to think what APR is. Wherever that is."
"It suggests that there's a significant benefit. We're using those inhalers and to compare it with heart studies and diabetes studies are significant. So, it's suggesting that there's a similar benefit versus heart ones and that's relatively impactful because it puts things into context. Everyone gives people statins and so that concentrates the mind a little bit."
"Well, obviously, going to hospital with COPD is very bad. It increases the risk of death and other comorbidities like heart attacks and stuff. So, going to hospital is bad."
"You're on a vicious cycle downwards. Like a vortex or a whirlpool, you'll get sucked down into death with an exacerbation. It's a doom and gloom side."
I think it complicates things and actually takes away from the quite straightforward message. The visualization helped but there's too much text compared with the previous.
"Again, it's better than the previous slide. But, again, it's potentially less impactful. It's better than the one we just had, but it's not as good as the original. And perhaps if they changed them to men, like the figures before, you could say, ""Two men versus one,"" or something like that."
"Yeah. Potentially, that puts things in terms of actual numbers, doesn't it?"
"I'm trying to... It's quite small. So, I prefer UC."
"UC, one. U, two. UB, three. And UD, four."
For the simple reason that UD doesn't say why Trixeo stops that.
"The left bit, the left graph, I'm pretty sure we've seen before, haven't we? The 52 and 18. Maybe it was slightly different."
I'm not sure what you're getting at except that it's the same sort of reduction. One versus down to half. I appreciate they didn't necessarily have a history of exacerbation but that's pretty irrelevant.
"Except that you're, by definition, then selecting out a milder population. Because the ECLIPSE studies was just three year studies, suggesting that if you've had exacerbations before, you're more likely to get exacerbations again. And what you've just said then is that this is selecting out a patient's population that isn't exacerbating and therefore you are reducing exacerbations in patients that don't exacerbate as much."
"They might be if they're diagnosed with COPD for another reason but... In outpatients, if they have a cough or breathlessness and we diagnose COPD, they're not necessarily exacerbating. Whereas, if I am on the ward seeing acute admissions, then they're two different populations in general. Granted, one can become the other, where someone can develop an exacerbation, but they are different from what I see as an outpatient versus an inpatient typically."
"Okay. Again, that's just emphasizing that most patients will have an exacerbation within three years. That's changing the data slightly. And if you just presented it for a year, it would be much lower. So, it's amplifying the risk of exacerbation using the existing data and legitimately. In my mind, it's suggesting that more patients will exacerbate because you've lengthened out the time. It's like saying, if you take a population over 10, 20 years, 99% of them will exacerbate. Well, they will, but it's over hyping it slightly."
"I think the pie charts can because it just emphasizes that... That's because of patients did not have exacerbation in the last year but 70% will exacerbate within three years. I have just appreciated that the headline thing at the top is that most will exacerbate within three years versus the pie chart which shows 74% is not exacerbating in the last year. So, that's slightly confusing but I've worked my way around it now. It will, again, just simply because of the graphic. A picture says a thousand words sometimes."
"Data on eosinophilic patients and non-eosinophilic patients. Trying to differentiate because that's quite important. That's what we do real world now, is decide whether they are or aren't eosinophilic and that will help guide treatment. So, data on those will be helpful."
Smokers versus non-smokers. And then some sort of direct head-to-head comparison if anyone's willing to do it. If they've got data on Trixeo versus Trimbow versus Trelegy.
Sorry. Are you being asked a question or something?
"Yeah. On the right, it doesn't matter that you've had an exacerbation or not, you're going to do better with Trixeo versus a LABA/LAMA."
And that's significant. The confidence intervals are beyond the line of one.
I don't think Mike adds anything at all to that story by the way. If you could just take that slide out.
Which looks very good but for the small percentage change on the y axis but yep.
"I think it does. A lot of the percentages are similar through the story. If you're going to have Mike in it, put him right at the end to say, ""Give Mike Trixeo based on everything you've just read."" But I don't think it adds a huge amount."
"Obviously, COPD is symptomatic, it has a wide range of effects on other organs. Exacerbating is bad in that it leads to hospitalization which increases a risk of death. Over and above any other existing treatment class, Trixeo reduces mortality and reduces exacerbations and improves symptoms by whatever percent... Either 20 or 50, depending on what you're comparing it with. And it should be therefore offered to patients, both exacerbating and non exacerbating, based on reduction in risk and potential reduction in mortality."
"Well, I guess that it's an aerosol inhaler, whether it can or can't be used with an AeroChamber. But, again, it's late to the party. Why would we use it over Trimbow which is on formulary? And what benefit over Trimbow, which none of that data over an existing triple, does it offer? That's the point that's being missed so far in all that data. I've got no problem with prescribing it, but the question is, why should I prescribe it over Trimbow?"
I'd be surprised if it wasn't. No worries.
"Good morning, Angelina. I now have our doctor on the line. Go ahead, please."
"Yeah. Oh yeah. So, thanks for the introduction. I work in a very busy practice. So, I deal with approximately 11,000 patients size."
"Yeah. And typically we have 5-6% population patient COPD, different severities. So, we deal with mix of patients on a daily basis, approximately usually about 50 patients a day. And it's not unusual to have patients, within those 50 patients a day, to have probably five to 10 who may have problems related to COPD. So, they are pretty dense terms of seeking intervention, especially the time of the year."
"So I mean, my role basically usually is a combination of annual routine reviews opportunistic. So, we book them in when they're flagged up as required a bit of a conversation about their treatment, but also I deal with acute exacerbations. So, infections in patients who have COPD. Yeah. So, that's just a brief summary of this scope of what we...   00:04:17 ."
"Yes. So, we have nurse practitioners, who also help in the recall and routine reviews. We work hand in hand with them because often when interventions are required, then we often get involved."
"Yeah. I mean, it almost become mainstream line of treatment. We actually quite quickly get patients onto a single triple therapy, just because of the shared benefits of compliance, and also the fact that you reduced a number of inhalers into one. So, it's something that we use often, yes."
"Well, I mean, I think in olden days we hesitate to optimize treatment and sort of stay on, for instance, ICS/LABA for a fairly lengthy timeframe before considering optimizing it. But I think now, if we're not achieving control within the one or two months of trial and therapy, we optimize it."
"Well, I mean, our diagnosis often it's a bit slower because you want to see at what level you are able to achieve control."
"Yeah. So, it's more little bit more slower and it takes getting used to sort of treatment before we can get it up to the maximum, but usually optimizing patients to triple therapies when they're on different combinations of different sorts of inhalers, which we can achieve with the triple therapy."
"Well, I mean, usually the most important factor is we really don't want over medicalize COPD, especially in cases where first of all, in reality, often it's not clear court. Even though in research it might be, but in reality it isn't often straightforward to know exactly who has combination asthma, COPD, or just COPD, or probably just recurring infection, or whatnot. Even those barometry and objective assessment often not very reliable. So, yeah. I mean, we sort of deal with it as it comes."
"Out of hundred, I would say close to 60% of that."
"So, majority of our patients would be on triple therapy, just because they're already on triple therapy anyway."
"But in different inhalers. So, yeah. We are using a lot more of the combination inhaler and patients do like them."
"We sort of collocally refer to as triple therapy. So, when you're on the single fix dose combination."
"Well, yes. Yes. I mean, we know really more about two formulations of triple therapy, which is fairly common in the UK."
"So, we have the one that is pressurized metered dose inhaler, which..."
"... Fairly familiar patients find that almost like I know what they're used to, using for many years."
"But we also have the dry powder option. So, those two have been mainstream. And I think it would've been from conversations with pharmaceutical agents, who'd introduce these, but also we do our own bit of looking around and searching for what's available for our patients. So, those two, I'd say, jump to my mind."
"There's always the conversation, and this is something I'm not strongly a believer in, there's always a conversation about fine particles and micro-fine particles and or whatnot. I feel that often, it's fine giving the one the patient's happy with, no matter how fine the particles are. If they're not happy with it, it's still not going to work."
"So, it is the size of the particle that, I recollect, has always been the main talking point when comparing the dry powder option with the meter dose inhaler option. Yeah."
"Yeah. I mean, I think we're very familiar with the fact that a lot of patients are not on our register may be having lots of antibiotic for infection, but no one has really diagnosed them with COPD, that's quite often."
"Yeah. That's all always a problem for us. It doesn't help the access to proper spirometry, has been very limited. Not helped by the pandemic, and patients don't like a COPD diagnosis made based on clinical judgment. They hate it. They like proper diagnostic assessment for some reason, but that's always been a battle for us to actually treat them without having to have this biometry. But otherwise, I mean, I'm familiar with all the figures...   00:13:50 ."
"I mean, totally leading course of death worldwide. Yeah, yeah. A bit of a surprise. It's a primary cause of death. Probably likely to be the case in the UK, but maybe predisposed them to infection which then causes the death. But yeah, that stands out."
"It's really encouraging proactive approach. I can see that because if we're doing a bit more early, then the chances that on diagnose reduced, admission reduced. So, yeah."
Yeah. It's just a matter of being a GP. You do begin to have a realistic perspective of what can can be done.
"It does affect you. Preventive treatment, early treatment, COPD is terribly the difficult dealing with normal people who are not ill. Easier when they actually going to hospital."
"But when you call someone on the phone, presenting them with a possibility that they might need to check up because they've smoked for years, they're not going to talk to you."
"So, that's why the motivation, the figures have always been in my mind, we've always back rolled. We never achieved more than 50% of our targets in terms of recalling COPD, meeting targets and bringing them in for review. So, yeah. It's been a challenge."
Yeah. It's very familiar with the connection between different social classes in the society and the chances of being a heavy smoker and rest pollution. Yeah. Familiar with this.
"No, that's fine. That's fairly consistent with what I think."
"Yeah. It is very relevant information. It's seven, I'd say."
"About social target. Yeah. I'd say six, seven. Seven."
"Yeah. The messages is, and exacerbation, is not a one off bleep that returns normal. It carries on affecting the patient in different ways, mental health and you know, it, the impact it just beyond the breathlessness. I think that's the message really."
"Maybe looking at it from my experience point of view, I would say a lot less number, not reporting a lot less number not reporting it..."
"I would say maybe close to 10% that would have an exacerbation and not seek help. I think maybe in the UK we have access, patients have numbers they can ring when they're wheezy."
"So, it would be unlikely that a lot of patients in that number would not be reporting their breathlessness. People report often cold. So, I imagine with a wheeze, most certainly."
"Well, I mean, I think it's the quality of life that stands out. The fact that a frequent exacerbation can actually eventually cause all sorts of cascade of problems for patients."
"I mean, it's always going to be a lot motivation, for me as a primary physician, when the bottom line is patients' wellbeing. And in this case, that's what this is describing, is reminding us that the impact is not just the short term, but a lot of things that would then cause even more problems, therefore almost saying efforts to do something about it is well worth it."
"Yeah. I mean, I think I'm familiar with the understanding that lung function doesn't bounce back."
"Yeah. Yeah. Very. It's similar to what takes place and asthma. So, asthma's best to start removing inflammation early. So, you save some lung function. I think COPD same applies. Bad exacerbation, leave the patient worse off, eventually, even though they're back to normal."
"I find that interesting actually, because it almost feels like they're saying the very, very severe ones have got to the limit of decline that they don't decline as much as the mild ones. That's interesting, actually. That's not what I would've thought. I would've thought a mild COPD can cope a bit better with an effective exacerbation. They often don't get really too bad, therefore I didn't expect that they would drop their lung function that massively."
"Yeah, it is. It is kind of inconsistent with what I would've thought. I have a tendency to do a lot more for a patient, who's known to have severe COPD or very severe, a lot more, in preventing exacerbation, sometimes even putting them on prophylactic antibiotic. But the mild patients, I tend to not do that much in stopping the exacerbation, prophylactically stopping the exacerbation if I say, but this is interesting."
"Yeah, it's very relevant. So, it's seven."
"Yeah. It's interesting because one of the criteria that we use to target the patients who would prioritize. So we will prioritize for a review is number of exacerbation recorded in the system for them. And this makes sense because if you're having two many exacerbations, then your outlook is not looking very good. So..."
Exacerbation being a target for identifying patients that might need a lot more intervention is really useful.
"Yeah. Yeah. I think the takeaway for me, again, from a primary physician point of view, is actually the capturing and documentation of episodes of exacerbation correctly."
"... No matter how good we work hard with patients, if you do not highlight exacerbation, there's no way we can search or find out, or verify how many have had two exacerbations the last year or audit the record. So, yeah. The takeaway here is actually emphasize on documenting exacerbation in a way that it can be accessed readily for audit and monitoring hypothesis."
"A bit of surprise. I suppose the one would look at it from whether the patients there referring to are really severe or mild COPD. I wouldn't expect someone the mild COPD, for instance, after a few exacerbations to then have a life span of five years. That would be a surprise for me. Sever COPD, we treat that as possible terminal and then we do all we can to support them. And sometimes they are looked at in the community by palliative team because a lot of symptom control are becoming involved. But, yeah. It really depends on the severity of the patient that they're referring to."
"It is relevant. Yeah. Is relevant. It's the reality that we are faced with. So, yeah. I would say seven, is very relevant."
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. Yeah. That's interesting.
"I mean, most of the patients who are COPD are usually long term heavy smokers, and it doesn't then surprise us that apart from the fact that they've developed COPD, they probably have developed multiple sclerosis anyway to become hypertensive."
"So, I'm not surprised that the CV event includes, what surprises me is that the exacerbation itself sort of appeared to be triggering an MI..."
"... In some of the cases. So, that's what's a little bit surprising."
"Mm. I mean, my assumption would be that they already have increased risk of MI whether or not they have exacerbation. It could be because of the lifestyle, which is always often in the background of the COPD patient. You do get COPD patients with comorbidities often. It's unusual to have someone with COPD and that's it, very unusual."
"Yes. I mean the 40% increased risk of stroke. Yeah. Within six to seven days, it's nothing that I don't often think about. Or less, of course, we're referring to really elderly patients in this circumstance. Yeah."
 inaudible 00:33:18 . Yes. I'd say new that there is 90% increase.
"No, it's not a surprise. I don't think it's a surprise. I didn't think it was that high, but it's not a surprise."
"Yeah, it is relevant. I'll give you seven."
"It's the hit you the reality of mortality figures just within a year of an exacerbation, thinking that I deal with exacerbation all the time."
"And I don't see patients who I treat for exacerbation a potentially going to have the stroke within a year. And that information, for me, it's very important in the way I treat them. Yeah."
"Mm. Yeah. I mean, this is more like what I would think. This is more how I see COPD patients. I see them in the context of their other comorbidities."
"Diabetes and atrial fibrillation, especially."
I think it is really just highlighting the fact that COPD shouldn't really just be seen as a standalone problem.
"There's always a possibility that something else is logging around, if not already known."
"No. I mean, it's fairly routine COPD, which we try and think about cardiovascular risk. Like what I mentioned about smoking being a common risk factor, I mean that it is always sensible to do a CBD risk assessment, which involves blood pressure, fasting sugar, and an ECG. So, we think about it that way. Yeah."
"Not necessarily. No, not necessarily in that way, actually."
"Yeah. It's just making sure we look beyond. We try and look beyond the COPD and COPD management, but also think about death prevention from looking for, and intervening for other conditions that we can also have impact on."
"That moderate COPD are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease. That's surprising. It doesn't add up, what you would expect in real life."
"Yeah. I mean, moderate amount. You wouldn't expect to see, firstly, more death, no matter the cause. But if you talking cardiovascular disease, COPD it's a slow deteriorating condition. So, it's often most of my patients who have severe COPD are much older than the patients who have moderate COPD. And using that fact of age alone, I would expect a lot more cardiovascular disease in patients with severe COPD. But if it is the case, if this is talking about someone young having severe COPD, which is unusual, really unusual or often the diagnosis was made at 45. And then at 60, 65, that's when you start seeing severe progressed COPD, especially   00:39:49  those that... Yeah. Especially those that didn't manage to stop smoking. So, if this was severe COPD and moderate COPD, and so sort of similar age group, then maybe it would make sense. Then I would say, ""Okay."" Maybe if you're severe, if you're moderate COPD when you're young, it still doesn't add up really."
Yeah. I'm intrigued to say the least. I'm intrigued to find out how that conclusion was made because it wouldn't surprise me if it was made on the basis of statistics rather than path of physiology.
Yeah. It does. It does. It just makes you take a little bit more serious than you would've normally in thinking about who to target. Yeah.
"Yeah. I mean again, it just keeps highlighting how much of the damage an exacerbation can cause. So, in a way it's a reminder to us, isn't it? That whatever we do to prevent exacerbation may well reduce mortality."
Yeah. I think so. I think it makes sense. It does make sense with the  inaudible 00:43:12 . Yeah.   00:43:14 .
"It's very useful, really is. Yeah. It's more like what we would normally want to see. Statistics very helpful, but being a GP, you apply whatever figure on an individual patient. And therefore, I often prefer the part of physiology than the figures could. The figures might be so accurate, but it might not apply to one individual."
"Yeah. Again, it's the   00:43:59  exacerbation again. It's preventing exacerbation rather than identifying and treating exacerbation. Preventing it's well worth it because it's a lot."
"Yeah. I mean past history of COPD, we have patients who are registered COPD on the record, and those are the ones we target for review. So, I think that's fine. Increased breathlessness, it's more symptom control, either wasn't in COPD or not being treated maximally. So, that's okay. Oximetry counts are not really pragmatic in general practice, at least in the UK. We don't rely on that heavily, just because I think it's only just maybe a minority of our patient that would have any relevance in terms of oximetry. We do sometimes think about it if therapies are not giving the outcome that we expect, you'd probably check and see whether that patient is more likely to need more steroid than normal."
"Yeah. Yeah. That's automatically red, but that's when you are doing full blood count. Full blood count, it's often not done routinely in the context of routine review. It will be done when the patient is in hospital with exacerbation, but again, infection causes all sorts of problems with FBC that is difficult to interpret."
"Yeah. I mean, it's almost reminding us of clever way to target who might be at risk of exacerbation. Yeah."
"Yeah, we covered this really. I mean, it's clear that if your lung function doesn't return to baseline, then already you're worse off than where you started."
"Well again, it's information trying to, again, remind us of the need to prevent as exacerbation really. Or even when it occurred, to try and do a little bit more to lengthen the time for the next exacerbation."
"Yeah. I mean, it's difficult. It's difficult in your life to achieve what you really wish in this occasion. I mean, if patients have a exacerbation, we don't routinely then review them, but what happens is you try and optimize their therapy for that episodes."
"Yeah. That what we do in real practice. So, once you're in hospital, you've been discharged, we then have a look again at what you were on before you went to hospital and see what can be done to improve it."
"Yeah. That makes sense. So, just kind of either progressing COPD or poor symptom control. So, that makes sense that then they're likely to suffer again."
"No, it's fine. I'm familiar with the relationship between RC score and lung function capacity. So, then that would make sense that if you are breathless anyway, then you've lost quite a lot of lung capacity. So, risk of exacerbation is much higher. Yeah, definitely."
"Yeah. I mean, I think it's, again, maybe capturing the scoring properly because if we document exacerbation and document this score, one can easily see, again, in a busy world, you can see who is more at risk, who you prioritize for intervention."
Yeah. That's the one I was... There's always been issues about the role of eosinophil levels in patients.
"Your PD, but that's interesting, and that's new one for me."
"It's new the fact that you can identify patients that an FBC might help you stratify the risk. That's interesting for me, especially when we talked about the mild and moderate, who may not be too bad. Maybe that's something to take away and think about it a bit and see whether that use an FBC. For those of them not on inhaled corticosteroid, you might use that to help them make decisions about prevention or their preservation."
"Yeah. It's just the role. I think the role of a FBC test in someone who might appear not as bad, so there to help make decisions about risk. Yeah."
Stepwise treatment explanation  inaudible 00:53:43 . Okay. That's interesting. That's interesting. Yeah. That's interesting. Find that interesting.
Yeah. We've always worked on the basis of stepwise treatment.
"That's been really the way it is, but to think about it this way, that it might actually lose time by doing that."
"Yeah. Makes for a bit of a challenge. Hmm. But I guess what they're saying here is after exacerbation, just do everything you can."
Yeah. You probably want to go with triple therapy at that stage.
"I think you're right. I think it's just the message that if someone has had exacerbation, then time has passed already, I think. That's what the message is here. Exacerbation is not the beginning, but is an indication that maybe five, 10 years have gone already. Therefore, you haven't got time if you really want to reduce the frequency of the next exacerbation, maximized in therapy early is the message."
" inaudible 00:55:52  Can help transform the care, which is the patient  inaudible 00:56:00 .  Silence 00:56:03 to 00:56:17 . This is really good. Really good. I mean, can I have a copy of...   00:56:21 ."
Yeah. Definitely. I feel that the information is well put together and strongly persuasive for changing the practice in a surgery.
"It's actually the quantification of future risk. I think we think about COPD, well not we, I think about COPD in real life from identifying who is bad. So, they're focusing Mr. A not too bad, therefore I'll talk to Mr. B, who's been to hospital. But actually it may be better to look at all of them and see whether the person who's not bad, what is their risk of becoming bad? Because those are the ones you can make more of a difference if I put it that way, because they're the ones who decline massively. That's why I find this session really interesting. This idea that someone being mild COPD is not really good news, kind of. It is good that they're not too bad, but it may be an opportunity to make more difference, and that's what I didn't see before."
"I think the main thing, for me, from this information is the amount of decline in lung function for someone who is at the early stages of COPD, therefore the main message is, prevention of exacerbation should not only focus on the patients who are severe, but also focus also, probably even more, on the patients who haven't had exacerbation. By recognizing who is at risk and then, and actually optimizing management early in the ones that we don't normally optimize management."
The challenge is education. The challenge is going to be education.
"Education in sense that putting what I now know across to a patient so they can see it that way, making them understand that increasing what the treatment they're having, it's beneficial, even though they don't necessarily need it now. So, the challenge is really working with the patient to see the effort worthwhile in stopping exacerbation in the future."
"Professional education actually, sharing this amongst everyone would most certainly change how people think about it exacerbation, maybe how they document it and how they follow it up."
"An interesting one. This is a group that I'm interested in, really. So, yeah. They don't have any history of exacerbation and this is more likely majority of my patients, really. Okay. That's interesting. Yep. Next one."
Hmm. Okay. That makes sense. Steroid obviously. Yeah.
"I mean, I think the information is almost stepping away from what used to be the traditional way of thinking about COPD as opposed to asthma. So, COPD you control breathlessness with LAMA/LABA, do as much as you can. And then when they have exacerbation, you consider introducing steroid, especially the eosinophils high. But what this is showing me is that triple therapy has benefits even in patients who may not have a history of exacerbation. That's interesting.   01:04:56 ."
"Yeah. I mean, it's over a year and a significant number of patients. Yeah. I think it's fairly convincing. I'm not sure whether there was any mention about side effects. I don't expect any side effects with almost a topical steroid treatment, really."
I wouldn't expect issues to rise.   01:05:30 .
Yeah. That's very powerful information to have...
"To convince the team to look at what we do a little bit differently. Yeah, absolutely."
"Yeah. I'm convinced that the earlier, the better. Yeah. Definitely."
"Well I mean, it looks to me, firstly, any patient with exacerbation, for sure."
"History of exacerbation and then those without history of exacerbation, potentially identify the people at risk. So, breathlessness and eosinophil field count if they're not on steroid."
"So, the patients at risk, I think are patients who already have score more than two on the MRC chart..."
... Should be targeted. Yeah. And patients who've had exacerbation obviously.
"Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So, patients with other the risk factors. Yes. Right."
"Well, I mean, I think it's probably an option early in the treatment decision, depending on individual patient. But I think it's likely that, that would sit quite comfortably early on in some patients here."
"I mean, again, it is the on diagnosed. It's one that sticks out again, we are having a conversation that mild cases are probably even likely to benefit more from intervention. So, that sticks out. Yeah."
"So, yeah. I mean, nothing really, just we have to share economic class."
"So, D it's definitely compelling, the reduction in the mild lung function. Yeah."
"Yeah. Again, compelling, just highlighting why an exacerbation is not a good means for the patient."
"Yes. Very compelling. Again, cardiovascular risk."
Yeah. Same. Cardiovascular comorbidities work looking at it.
"Yeah. This is the one we talked about, but I mean, understanding the path physiology makes sense that CV deaths are more likely, while respiratory deaths more likely into the..."
"Yeah. I like this one a lot, because that's really how to think about who's at risk."
"Hmm.   01:12:37 . Yeah. Really compelling. Yes. So, all the risk factors."
"Yeah. It's the page where the mild cases decline in lung function a lot, lot more than the severe in terms of percentage. So, presenting   01:13:31  this one. Yeah."
"So, this is a very strong message to clinicians who deal with patients who may not be ill. And then, because I've seen occasions when inhalers have been withdrawn because the patient is absolutely fine."
But this is a compelling message to actually... Those are the ones you should keep on the inhalers because you're going to get more benefits out of treating them than not.
No. Nothing. That's fairly comprehensive in looking at preventing exacerbation.
"Ah. It's always going to be, apart from getting it right with the content of inhaler, it's always so getting it right with the device."
Mm. Really important. Has to be something that's easy to use.
"No, that all sounds great. I'm sure that the HFpEF patient journey is something that I can help you with."
"Yeah, delighted to. Good morning to the others on the call as well. So I'm a cardiologist working primarily in the south of England, teaching hospital with about 900 to 1000 beds, something like that. Involved with all aspects of general cardiologies, I also have some specialist interests in advanced imaging of heart disease, in particular magnetic resonance and device therapies for heart failure. So we encounter patients with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction very frequently. They come across both the inpatient and outpatient spectrum of our practice and they form an increasingly common part of our workload."
"Yeah, I think I would say that I'm probably about 60% inpatient, 40% outpatients."
"Yeah, I think it's controversial. I think I have started to conceptualize it in that way and I've been swayed slightly by some of the emerging data and sub-analyses that come out the trials of SGLT2 inhibitors and antigens and neprilysin inhibitors suggesting that the benefit from those drugs probably does extend into the mildly reduced ejection fraction range, even outside of the conventional HFrEF criteria. So yeah, I guess I have started to draw that distinction in my head, but I tend, strictly speaking sort of classification diagnosis, I tend to keep it to HFrEF, HFpEF."
"So an interesting question on that, on what we're going to think more about I'm sure."
"Sure, sure. When you look at the data for all comers across hospitals in the UK, actually we think that of those attending hospital, the diagnosis of heart failure is of reduced admissions. Then we think that probably HFpEF represents about 50% of our admissions. Now, do all 50% of those patients with HFpEF get to see a cardiologist? Probably not, actually. Probably some of them get alternative diagnoses and managed in different ways and by colleagues across the hospital sector. So I think that, whereas perhaps 50% of people arriving almost they do have HFpEF, I think probably my personal practice is probably seen more like about 20 to 30% HFpEF and 70 to 80% HFrEF."
"So most of the ... most of our energies rightly or wrongly, and probably wrongly actually, get focused primarily on the HFrEF group. And that's due to a whole myriad of different factors and many of the targets and metrics that we have to hit are built up around HFrEF, of course, that need to begin specific interventions has a greater evidence base in many cases in HFrEF. And so all sort of influences. It's the easiest to diagnose as well, of course. So for many reasons, a disproportionate amount of our effort is applied in the HFrEF group, though we're conscious that we need to look at ways to improve that and do better in HFpEF."
"I think what we'll probably see is an increased focus on natriuretic peptides for diagnosis, which is going to start capturing a lot more of these people. And then hopefully with better access to ... bit better access to echo, rapid echo diagnostics, better focus on some of the more detailed aspects of the echocardiographic examination that can give you a diagnosis of HFpEF. And a better focus on picking up those conditions within HFpEF that do have specific treatment options that, I think with all of these factors, are going to combine together to put a greater focus on the accuracy of diagnosis and in accurately capturing the people affected by this condition. And I think perhaps the example I would cite there is if you were to look at, for example, ATTR amyloidosis than in the past, there was a condition which we sort of found quite interesting to diagnose."
"Sometimes we had no particularly specific treatment options that we'd applied to do it. And so there was a ... there was a strong school of thought that said, well, how much effort do you want to invest diagnosing this condition that you can't do anything very specifically to treat and does it really matter? But I think as new options come online for treatment, that then focuses the attention on better capturing the patients and making best diagnosis. I think I do see growth for diagnosis and treatment options in HFpEF. And some rebalancing of that imbalance that I suggested earlier."
"Yeah. So an echo assessment of diastology has a number of reports. Of course, you've got to start off with good imaging of the left ventricle for the ejection fraction. That's cool. But you always look at the E2A ratios. E3 prime ratios would be the single number I would pick out of an echocardiographic examination if I had to rely on it. I also like to look at the S prime velocities in particular, if there's ... if you can get a good pulmonary vein Doppler trace, then that's important too."
"Well, I think what's happening is you're getting people who are attending the hospital with a clinical syndrome that's compatible with heart failure, though there are a number of other possibilities that go along with that. And alongside the many potential differential diagnoses, including heart failure, there's a whole range of other conditions. Things like pulmonary embolisms and chest infections, and more or less we've already spoken of other ... all sorts of different conditions that can cause people to become breathless."
"Remember, we're talking here about predominantly elderly people who are disproportionately female that's probably affected by hypertension. And what happens I think is that you ... that they sort of enter the non-selected hospital catchment group through our equivalent of hospitalists and general medicine specialists, who do an amazing job of separating out a great deal of unfiltered pathophysiology, and really focusing on the things that are important. But it's unrealistic to expect our colleagues at the front door to be able to engage with the subtlety of echocardiographic diagnosis of HFpEF, and when does an E3 prime ratio become abnormal. And how does that become ... how as that becomes abnormally in different age groups and things as well."
"And they, they have to quite rightly focus their attention on the most serious pathologies that have definite treatment aspects of anticoagulating, pulmonary embolism, antibiotics for pneumonia. And of course, even if they can get ready access to an echo, then the interpretation of that. So largely folks around looking at the really serious stuff, or is there severe bowel pathology that needs treatment? Is there significant HFrEF that we need to start instituting guideline directed medical therapy for. And so in that wider context, you can see how some of the attention doesn't get focused on the HFpEF, and then if I was sort of go to them, say, no guys, look, you need to really engage with this. And let's sort of start going through all these ratios and things. And they're going to say, well, let's say you do find an E3 prime ratio that's slightly up and you make a diagnosis of HFpEF and you've confirmed it beautifully, and you've done an HFA-PEFF score and things. What are you going to do differently?"
"The answer is then why are we investing this time and effort to do this? And I can't say, well look guys, there's this great new drug that you've got to put these people on. They're going to stop coming back into hospital if you give it to them. The answer is that it's gentle diuretics and by and large get on with it. So it's complex, it's difficult. And as, as I say, I think I was really interested in some of the new options coming online for better treatments of HFpEF. And I think the once those become available, then we're in a much better place to start resourcing our teams at the front door to change how they do this."
"Yeah, exactly. It's complex and it's difficult and people are going to say, so why ... why are you so keen to make this diagnosis given that you don't have a particular specific treatment option you can apply to it to make these people better. If your treatment's going to be the same in that case, why are you investing this time and effort?"
"Yeah, I think, I think that probably the first step in changing the ... in changing that conversation so ... alongside, alongside interest, of course, arguably the first sort of ... the first green shoots of specific therapy options for HFpEF. I think that's, of course, the magnitude of the effects that you see with SGLT2 inhibitors seems as with some of the other agents to be sort of a bit proportional the reduction ejection fraction, right? So the lower your ejection fraction, the better you do. And once you sort of start getting up past 55, 60%, then you've got a different question about whether you're sort of actually really dealing with HFpEF at all, or whether there's a different condition underlying here."
"But I think that, yeah, for the first time, if we can start saying, now look guys, there's an option here that we can start applying to these patients. And then particularly, of course, many of these patients commonly are ... have comorbid kid ... chronic kidney disease and renal impairments. And you can say, well look, no, no, no, actually it's not the case. You sort of make the heart better to make the kidneys, whereas actually you can intervene and make both of these better. Then that becomes a much more interesting message I think, and the sort of thing that people can get behind."
"Yeah. So the proportion I see is skewed slightly by the referral pattern is probably not necessarily representative of the true pathophysiology ... the true prevalence of what's happening here. But in terms of the referral pathway, I see most of these people in outpatients clinics. And the reason for that is that the pathway is set up such that people with breathlessness can be screened in the community by, by having a BNP or an NT-proBNP measured. And if that's elevated, then there's a pathway that gets them referred up to the clinic where an echo scan, various other assessments can be made and the diagnosis can be reached at that point. So people sort of being screened pretty effectively like that and get seen that way. For the inpatients who've decompensated slight differences, as we said, it's more complicated. And generally when the echo scan comes back then and has reports to us of showing a normal ejection fraction, people assume that the cardiologists aren't going to be interested and get on and just deal with it."
"So in terms the proportion, I see, let's try to put some numbers on it. I'd say it's probably approximately 80% in the outpatient clinic and maybe 20% in the inpatient setting."
"Yeah, I think ... I think that would be reasonably common, actually."
"Yeah, in the UK. Exactly. I think, I think so. I mean, referral thresholds vary across different healthcare systems and you say you'll get different answers from your colleagues in the US versus people in the UK on this. But generally we have a lot of folks on sort of minimizing the length of stay, trying to get people back into the community into their own environment, sort of managing things on an outpatient basis, big shift towards ambulatory medicines, trying to cope with the volume of people coming to hospital front doors. And I mean, there's sort of smart people who are doing this and they see a lot of unselected pathophysiology and things, and they say, well, look, are we really going to ... are we really going to wait a day here for a cardiology?"
"I mean, if they said that the BNP's up, we've done an echo ejection fraction is normal, everything's there. We know what's happening here. We know that these guys are probably just going to not be very interested and suggests that you treat them with some diuretics and it's going to take a day or two. So why don't we just do that ourselves? Again, I think in the US, you'd get a different response to that and there'd be much more focus on trying to make an active diagnosis, and some of that is driven by internal hospital pathways and reimbursements and all the rest of it. But the answer to your question is yes, in the UK, there are definitely a significant proportion of people who are getting a diagnosis of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction and are not seeing cardiologists at present. Again, that might very well change with ... with SGLT2 inhibitors and some of the other new options that's coming online."
"Yeah, no, I don't think that's an unfair question. I think that the follow-up is patchy."
"And I'm sure that in some ... in many cases there are sort of people who can follow up with GPs and primary care physicians, so you are going to be great and very engaged with that and have all the data. And in some cases they are going to be a bit overloaded and it might be a bit difficult to schedule the time to do it. And then the communication paperwork between the hospital back to primary care might or not always be quite as clear and specific as it might be about a diagnosis like this. And people might sort of tend to read through this saying, okay, what is the specific action we need to take here? What are we following up on? And what is the medication that we need to start and titrate and follow, and what are you asking me to do here? And the separate ... the separate points specific to the UK system is that the community heart failure specialist nursing teams have a pretty clear remit to focus on heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction."
"So really they are primarily there to make sure that people with HFrEF get on ... onto the full doses of guideline direct medical therapies. In fact, in many cases, they aren't actually even permitted to see people with HFpEF. There is a sort of the criteria that you have to have a low ejection fraction in order to see the community heart function nursing team."
"So these things, and maybe that's historical and a hangover from the past, but that is ... that is the reality of the slightly suboptimal situation that we find ourselves in."
"By and large, I think of them as being quite different disease processes. So the things that commonly cause HFrEF, so I mean, it's ischemic heart disease with big myocardial infarctions, things like that. Of course, it can happen due to valvular disease and other things as well. HFpEF, I think of much more different in terms of ... it's a disease of older people, sort of hypertension, stiffening of the ... stiffening of the left ventricle, a lot of overlap, as we've said already with ATTR amyloid, things like that. So I try to, regardless of whether it's HFrEF or HFpEF, I try to dig quite hard to figure out what is the underlying cause for it, and what's ... what is underlying the presentation. So I do think of them as being quite distinct in those terms. Where the classification becomes useful, of course, is in treatment pathways as set up by funders and also in treatment options, of course, as well."
"Yeah, sure. Well, look, I mean, we see a lot of these cases and I've tried to pick a couple that would be representative of common situations rather than sort of reaching for the rarest cases that we really have on our shelves. But this is obviously a ... an older lady actually in her late seventies. A very intimate presentation, sort of, just sort of mild symptoms of breathlessness on exertion, which have been present for quite some months now. And then there's a little trace of edema in legs as well. The clinical examination's pretty unremarkable, but the natriuretic peptides have been measured by a very bone steep primary care practitioner and have been found to be kind of, sort of abnormal kind of low level normal range and has been referred on up to the clinic. And an echo has been performed and there's sort of small left ventricle, a sort of mild concentric hypertrophy, sort of trace amounts of regurgitation, nothing above significance, but that sort of common pattern of stiffening where there is reversed E2A ratio, an E3 prime ratio that's elevated, too."
"So hypertension, I should have mentioned the other fact that's important to mention here, of course, is about body rates. The BMI was about 32 as I recall in this case. So this sort of combination of hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, aging, all particularly in a lady, all sort of line up to make a pretty clear diagnosis there as well. Of course, you have a little thing and you think, well, could, could this be a sort of ATTR amyloid copying or something as well as you send off the serum, and urine light chains to evaluate for that. And you can, you can think about going ahead to get a DPD scan or something as well to rule that out. But there are none of the other features like carpal tunnel or spinal stenosis, anything else like that. So pretty confident this is a common or garden case of HFpEF driven by metabolic comorbidity."
"And in this situation, then we're kind of in this sort ejection fraction, but 59 is almost 60% and kind of right in the regions of really borderline for benefit from SGLT2 inhibitors and Entresto. But what you can do that's sensible, of course, is to treat the hypertension. And we kind of extrapolate from some of the previous data that's there, and take angiotensin receptor blocker is a sensible way to do that. It may or may not help with the symptoms and it may or may not at some point be sensible also to introduce a low dose of a diuretic to also treat hypertension and the peripheral edema."
"But I'd expect a pretty indolent course here, pretty modest benefit, but a pretty low rate of decline as well, and you explain the diagnosis. And in fact, we don't really have the capacity to follow these people up very closely. So the important thing is here to make a diagnosis, provide advice back to the primary care team on how to manage it, and then be available to support if needed in the future. But I don't propose to follow this lady as closely in the clinic as I might otherwise want to do."
"I would want to see it. Yeah. We sort of spoke earlier about kind of the mid range or mildly reduced classification. At the moment, that's still where I am on this. Like I think ... I think had this been sort of 49 rather than 59, then I might have been ... I might have been more swayed in that direction. But once you sort of start getting up towards 60%, I mean, the benefits and the trials were pretty limited. I guess, look ... if you tried some ... if you tried telmisartan and tried some diuretics and the hypertension was well controlled and maybe she'd lost a bit of weight and then came back and said, no, no, this is unacceptable. I'm still too breathless. This is not right. And I must have something done about it. Then I think in that case, then I might sort of with a very careful discussion beforehand about risks and accepted benefits, then probably initiate that case."
"Yeah, I should have said that type two diabetes would be another factor that would tip me further in that direction. In fact, I was, I was going to come onto that in the next case actually, anticipating that might be an aspect of the discussion. So yeah, type two diabetes would be another good reason to go there. Because then you've got an option, right? I mean, you need to start something to treat the type two diabetes, and you're either going to be using Metformin with no particular benefit for HFpEF but, or you're going to pick an SGLT2 inhibitor instead with benefits for HFpEF, benefits for cardiovascular risk, et cetera."
"So yeah, had there been some significant type to diabetes or if the ejection fraction had been about 10 points lower, or if the patient had sort of tried some admittedly non-evidence based first line therapies failed them, come back and said, no, I want something else. Those would've been the factors that would've tipped towards SGLT2 initiation in this case at this time. But the direction travel is clear and who knows maybe, maybe in two, three years time, then we're initiating upfront in these people."
"I mean, renal ... I mean, technically, of course, it should be another factor that would tip you towards initiating. So let's say the eGFR had been 50 here and there'd been a sort of gradual downward trend then, of course, the correct answer again is probably to initiate an SGLT2 inhibitor at that point. That is going to probably, I mean, I think this message is still filtering through, down through my colleagues. I can see that it might provoke some unease and know that, of course, you expect your little slight initial reduction in eGFR after initiating SGLT2 in this setting. And people might say, no, I'm not quite sure why we're doing this, but again, really, it should be a factor probably that you should consider alongside type two diabetes as being maybe a ... maybe a tipping factor if you were wavering."
"Yeah, I think those patients have got the most benefit from it and not a lot have been initiated yet. And they are probably where we should be focusing our energies."
"Yeah. I mean, I find, I know ... I mean, I know you should sort of take subgroup analyses and secondary endpoints in trials with caution. I know the trials were designed such that all HFpEF patients could be initiated, but I find the subgroup analyses including the natriuretic peptides. Once you sort of start looking into ejection fraction grossing 55, 60%, then I find myself thinking, well, are we dealing with a different disease here? I mean, the benefit is really strikingly attenuated. So I'm still looking at the ejection fraction, the comorbidities, the diabetes status, things like that to make a decision. Maybe, maybe we'll get it that way at some point in the future. But just in this early phase of initiation, I think I'm ... we sort of want to build confidence in the patients who have the most to gain from this."
"Yeah, that's, that's correct. And clinical picture is important. There also instance I've integrated the fact that the natriuretic peptides were elevated. If they hadn't been, I would've rethought. And likewise, and that, I think that's sort of really the single most important fact here, along with the symptoms and signs, in terms of the echo, the findings, as you know, are nonspecific. They can go with aging, not everybody with a reverse E2A ratio and an elevated E3 prime gets heart failure and not everyone with heart failure has them, but the combination together is pretty compelling. And I think in this case, I'm pretty confident about the diagnosis. I think it's appropriate to make the diagnosis here as well and to initiate some treatments. It's not always this clear cut."
"Yeah. So I mean, you can have a pretty high degree of confidence in the diagnosis here. So if I was to run this into run all these factors into the HFA-PEFF score, the H2PEF score, something like that, then I'm sure they would line up as being, they would line up with HFpEF diagnosis with high confidence here. When I sort of talk about it being appropriate to make a diagnosis, that's ... let's just think about that a little more. So if one of these aspects was discordant or something was unclear, and if the symptoms were minor and if the elevation and naturalized peptides was only marginally elevated, and we are talking about in elderly patients who maybe doesn't want us to sort of start taking exercise stress and invasive routes to get to the bottom of things. Sometimes, sometimes it's appropriate to be pragmatic in these situations and say, look, on the balance of probabilities here, there probably is an element of HFpEF, and I can't prove it, but even if I could it's question as to whether there's a specific treatment option that we can indicate."
"So let's see how things go for a little bit. And if there's ... if there's no particular deterioration symptoms and your patient is satisfied with the status quo, maybe we just carry on there as well, and take a take sort of a relaxed and pragmatic approach to it. Now, of course, that's different if you're sort of faced with a 60 year old who's had a dramatic decline in their effort tolerance, usually you're going to go to the end of the earth to get to the bottom of it and initiate aggressive treatments. Things like it's not always appropriate in frail elderly people, particularly where there's significant comorbidity."
"Per person? Personally, I prefer HFA-PEFF, but H2PEF is another good scoring system that you can use."
"I use it when I'm ... I kind of use it to support intuition, I guess. So in this case, you've got the important triad of symptoms and signs and natriuretic peptides and echo findings. And so this will, well, I guess in borderline cases, or I'm not sure, or if I'm trying to build a case and say, no, no, this is, this is really equivocal. And we need to think about doing something like a cardiopulmonary exercise test with echo or something, or potentially might try catheterization with exercise. Not that we have a great deal of access to that in the UK, then those sort of gray zones then. And likewise, also, if you're trying to refute the diagnosis, actually they're quite helpful. So if you have a really low score, then you can have a pretty high degree of confidence that ... and you're not dealing with that. And you can start to look for other angles."
"I would say, I think ... I think their use is growing, but I couldn't argue that they were widespread in use even among cardiologists. I'm probably more interested than most. And so is a reasonably early adopter, but"
"So, I think outside of cardiology, probably not being used at all within cardiology, maybe 20, 30% perhaps outside of specialist heart function clinics."
"Right. So yeah, the echo gets conducted up at the hospital on the same day of the assessment. So you get symptoms and signs, you get a blood test that initiates a referral pathway, and then the echo examination, the clinical assessment by a cardiologist happen on the same day."
"It can, it can. So particularly the one you always worry about is in obesity where it can be artificially low. There's a ... historically, there's been a bit of an issue with sort of samples sitting around in the community for a long time before they get analyzed up at the lab, and essentially into false negatives, too, which is diminishing with the use of N-terminal proBNP. So yeah, it can be. There's a potential gap in the system there. You'd be unlikely to miss ... I guess the argument that you'd be unlikely to miss severe cases. And ..."
"So there's still an override mechanism whereby somebody could write up and say, look, this guy's got all this, they've got a constellation of symptoms and signs of heart failure and is really symptomatic, but the BNP's normal, and I know this is unlikely. Can, can we still do some imaging here and figure this out? That can still happen, but it's not routine."
"Yeah, I think if you trace it back, it's been an inland process over year is rather than months. So let's put about, let's put about 18 months to two years, something like that."
"I think that, I think that is the pattern. I think generally sort of some very gradual onsets and just say, we're talking about a primary elderly population here with significant comorbidities and people think, oh well, I can't walk as far as I used to. And what's normal aging versus when is there a problem here. And then quite often it's driven by a family member who says, no, no, no, you're sort of really quite breathless here. This is ... we should probably get this looked at, something like this. So it takes long time to get there. And then people sort of head on into see their primary care physician and they sort of get a detailed examination, listen to their chest, and go everything sounds okay. And okay, well maybe we just, maybe we just see how this one goes, or maybe there's an abnormal clinical finding that prompts the need to do a blood test that happens at that point."
"So I think the sort of gradual slow process of building up to initially seeing a primary care physician, probably on average, maybe sort of a couple of visits to get blood tests done, to measure natriuretic peptides. And then if they're positive, then it depends on how positive they are as well. We sort of focus the urgency on the people with the highest elevations in natriuretic peptides, but sort of low elevation, maybe another month on something like that, to get up to a cardiology clinic and get a diagnosis with imaging."
"Yeah, yeah. Right. They definitely do. And that's, I mean, they do an amazing ... they do a really amazing job, and people's indices of suspicion are going to vary here. And some of it is mostly driven by the symptoms. Some of it'll be driven by the clinical signs of course, as well. And of course, as with so many countries, we've had a bit of a shift towards remote medicine over the past one to two years. And, but I think most people would still be bringing people with breathlessness up to be assessed. And it's just so important to listen to the chest and examine the heart and intravenous pressure and things like that. But yeah, I can certainly see how it would take, how it could take a couple of visits to initiate the cascade."
Yeah. I you're absolutely ... you're absolutely right. This is the ... this is the great challenge of HFrEF.
"Well, let's think now through. So, I mean ... always the way that the mechanism that you can take is to start applying a sort of a screening test, isn't it? So let's say you had a treatment that prevented people from HFpEF developing any clinical progression and being hospitalized at all. I mean, then you could sort of start to think about building a case for broad population screening with BNP, right? And then imaging people and figuring out what ... what's going on from there. And you sort of pick up valvulations and HFrEF and the ... and all the rest of it. So I think, I mean, that would be the extreme end of the spectrum. I don't think anybody's talking about going there at the moment. And of course you need symptoms and signs to get to a diagnosis of it in the first place."
"So I guess you could, I guess the only practical step you could take would be to encourage earlier natriuretic peptide testing in people who are breathlessness. And the other thing you would need to do if you were to do that would be to strengthen downstream pathway in terms of the provision of imaging capacity, because echo cardiography is ... it's not scarce, but we definitely don't have as many stenographers as we would like to do this. And they work very hard and there's a lot of downstream work that gets generated from this as well."
"So if you're going to boost that whole pathway, that's probably the place to start, but it's not enough just to do more blood tests in isolation."
"You've got to build capacities for the whole system to cope with that. And then again, you come back to the funders and they're going to say, well, look guys, I mean, even with SGLT2 inhibitors here, the benefits and the 60% plus group is pretty marginal. And are we really going to spending money on this rather than on better cancer diagnoses, things like that. That's kind of how these discussions inevitably play out."
"Show, show us that by making an earlier diagnosis, you stop people from coming into hospital and it saves more money than it costs to do it. That's kind of where this discussion inevitably ends up."
"Yeah, I do. I take a fairly reassuring line actually, and start off by ... really important to these people to acknowledge the symptoms. Okay. Quite often they sort of feel like there's been nothing too much wrong and they're kind of wasting everyone's time by going through us and having tests and things. And I kind of start off by saying, no, no, this ... this is a real thing that we've diagnosed here is an important thing. I sort of try to focus on the positives, too. Human heart failure is a really scary diagnosis to get. And, and people of course, leap to being the sort of thinking of the worst forms of heart failure and maybe it's of older people who've got friends who've, who've died from heart failure with the reduced ejection fraction and things like that. So saying you should sort of, acknowledge their symptoms are real, offer a diagnosis. But then make it clear that in terms of sort of the possible diagnoses to have, this isn't such a bad one, that there are some increasing treatment options."
"This isn't going to be a great deal of follow up. It's unlikely to get substantially worse. Though, of course, you can't exclude that possibility, but that many people can lead essentially normal lives. And then I think some of the other important messaging comes around management of metabolic comorbidities as well. And an explanation that weight loss is almost certainly going to be an important thing to do, that this doesn't need some regular follow up in a cardio clinic, but sort of diet, exercise and moderating blood pressure are all important steps in the management. So those kind of the processes that we walk through."
"The terms she would probably use back to something of the order of age related stiffening of the heart muscle, something like that."
So it's a less scary proposition though. The clinic letter that she and the primary care physician are all going to receive and read is going to read heart failure that was a preserve ejection fraction.
"Yeah, they certainly didn't until recently. And I think the there've been some sort of changes to the commissioning of that in recent months, until recently they did. This isn't a great use for open access type echos, actually, because again, there's so much subtlety to be captured in the echo reports and the interpretation of the numbers here, that this is probably better done by a cardiologist, right? Because I mean, I mean, look, you scan every person in their late seventies, they all have at least grade one diastolic dysfunction on the reports. And then when, when sort of grade one become grade two becomes significant, become grade three, things like that, and sort of digging down into the individual parameters that make up those kinds of schools. I think that's better done by a cardiologist."
"Well, at the moment, because there's a ... because there's a commissioned pathway for high natriuretic peptide carcinogens seems to come on up and just go. It's easier for them to, and quicker actually, to throw one up through that system, rather than going through an open access echo pathway."
"Right. So I think that works really well where you've sort of ... you've heard a murmur and you want to know what's going on. You want to know whether there is a bowel lesion or not. And is it severe or is it just, is it a bit of sort of mild natural regurgitation you detected. That sort of works really well for community echos."
"That's right. Because once it's up, then you're either dealing with HFpEF or HFrEF. If there's HFrEF, you want to know what the cause is, and is it ischemic and so will other treatments do that as well? So that all has to be done by us anyway. And if it's HFpEF, then you're probably going to need a bit of support in interpreting some of the fine points of the echo findings as well. So I ... it probably is better that this is handled via heart function clinics."
"Possibly. Again, the difficulties I would anticipate there lie in the interpretation of the findings and the communicating of the messaging, that not everybody with HFpEF will have every echo cardiographic parameter of diastolic dysfunction. Likewise, certainly not everybody with echocardiographic government of diastolic dysfunction is going to have HFpEF. And that's a message that would need to be carefully managed."
"Yeah, I think so. And in terms of sort of how, and the ability to go a step beyond, and not just interpreting the results and making a diagnosis, but figuring out what is the cause of the diagnosis. I think, unless you're sort of going to be dealing with a pathway that has GPs who have a sort of a really specialist interest in cardiology and ability to do that and access to other downstream investigations, like CT coronary angiograms and cardiac MRI, and the other things that we use in that situation. I think that could be problematic."
"Yeah. I think it ... so I think a lot of the drive in the inpatient setting comes from this need to minimize length of hospital stays and to sort of target your intervention, to probably get people out of the hospital, ambulate and then deal with everything else on an outpatient basis. So there's a different focus there, and you can, you can make a case that's figuring out the precise cause of the heart pain. Things can happen on an outpatient basis. And so people could, you would say, but it is not that a cardiologist doesn't need to be involved here. It's just, they don't need to be involved on an inpatient basis. We don't need to keep this person within a hospital bed in order for them to see a cardiologist in a day or two to look at this. So I think, I think there is a distinction there, and of course, ideally you would have the resourcing and cardiologists would see all these people and make proper diagnoses, but in terms of sort of targeting the available resources, then the current system seems to work and be reasonable in most cases."
"Right. So as I say, in the case of patient A here, there isn't going to be further follow-up with a cardiologist. The diagnosis made, the treatment strategy is set, and it would be a case of re-refer if this isn't working out and the patient's unhappy. So that there is ... there is just that there is insufficient capacity within the system to routinely followed these people up via the public system in the UK."
"It is followed by primary care. So again, the community heart failure services focused very much on HFrEF and titration of HFrEF therapies. So no, they aren't going to be able to follow this either."
"Yeah. For patient B it's, it is a slightly different proposition, isn't it? So you've got a younger patient who was ... is more strikingly symptomatic at the time of the presentation. So I think, I think we had it with past class three, I think actually. So it's a really quite limited with signs of body mobile load. Again, pretty confident the diagnosis of HFpEF here from the natriuretic peptide history examination findings. Obviously some more great concern for cardiac amyloidosis here, especially sort of in a history of rheumatoid arthritis, things in the past. So full work up here with, with the serum urinary light chains and a DPD scan and a cardiac MRI to get to the bottom of what was happening. But again, all the sort of signs towards the end of it pointing towards hypertension, metabolically driven, comorbidity and diagnosis of HFpEF instead."
"Now in this case, you've got a sort of set of younger, more symptomatic patients. And again, hopefully there was a diagnosis of type two diabetes, which was already being with Metformin in this case again, ejection fraction, just close to 50 than 60 as well. So this I think is a good example of somebody who can benefit from getting these kind of assessments and you can pretty confidently initiate on an SGLT2 inhibitor and have a reasonable prospect of expecting clinical benefit here."
"It's people, it's people who are more like patient B than patient A."
"So it's the younger, more symptomatic people here. In this case, I want to do some follow up because I'm still working up for amyloid, other conditions, things like that. And you could make a case to sort of just write back when the results are available. But I think in this case, particularly given the symptoms to start with and given the volume of investigations to get through and given also the fact that I want to sort of see for myself, whether there is benefit from having initiated an SGLT2 inhibitors, things like that, then you have a little bit of capacity to follow some of these people up, not many, but this is the kind of person that you would want to see again, to assess the response and just get all the investigations together."
"Yeah, kind of. I guess if you sort of put in, yeah ... I mean, for the ... in a lot of cases, the heart function specialist nursing teams will operate pretty independently and they will sort of work to ... once diagnosis has been made, there'll be work to choose up-titrates for the appropriate goal directed medical therapy. And they all sort of consult back with you if there's a problem. They won't necessarily CC you on every letter and every email detailing every point of the up-titration. And the GPs will be kept appraised of that and there'll be records of it, but again, you'd end up in a situation and information overload otherwise."
"Yeah, I ... again, per patient B here, will be somebody who, by virtue having an injection fraction of 52%, is going to fall outside of the eligibility for our heart function specialist nurses. So again, they can see me, but they can't see the nurses, if you see what I mean. So I have some flexibility to override that and bring back and see what's happening. So HFpEF is not a big proportion of their workload, as things stand, and this has come in ad hoc case by case basis. I wouldn't anticipate sort of very regular follow ups, either. It would be sort of the most symptomatic patients instead, maybe one visit in three months. And that's the end of it, maybe."
"Yeah, I definitely, I definitely hope so. So I think that ... yeah, again, it comes back to building up the whole pathway. So it's lower threshold testing for natriuretic peptides. It's better provision of echo for diagnosis, better provision of people who can interpret that and make a diagnosis. And then yes, absolutely. Once you have treatment options that improved symptoms reduce hospitalization broadly available, then yeah. Mechanisms are initiate those and follow them. Cause it isn't just SGLT2 inhibitors. I mean, there are plenty of other options coming on the pipeline as well here, which we're going to have to engage with. So yeah, I would hope that we can see development across the whole pathway. That's going to allow a more integrated provision of service, diagnosis and treatment for people with HFpEF. I think it's pretty well developed in HFrEF, actually. So there's a clear model to follow here and how we can drive and implement that into HFpEF and deliver benefit to those patients is going to be important and driven by the availability of new therapies."
"I think the sorts of things that happen, they get clinically reviewed for symptoms and probably blood tests for renal function would be the two things that really get followed here. I should probably have blood pressure in there as well. So I think if we sort of set treatment goals as being sort of controlled blood pressure, use of diuretics has needed to control blood pressure, control edema, things like that. Those are all things that can be really well handled in primary care. And of course with most medication initiation of up titration or down titration normally prompts some assessments of renal function as well, which again, our colleagues in primary care are very well placed to do,"
"Yeah. No ... not routinely. Again, I might do that on a case by case basis up in our clinic, but the sort of approved uses for naturals peptides of the diagnosis rather than for monitoring treatments, especially in primary care."
"Well, I'm really excited to see more of the ... more of the data coming out from things like there's some instance, some of the ... some of the mice and modulated drugs and HFpEF things like that, all coming online, being trialed in HFpEF. I think there was some, some compelling basis to think that those might have additional benefit. And so I guess what I'd like to see is a greater focus on ... a greater focus on accurate diagnosis, but then also the cause of the diagnosis as well. So sort of maybe continuing of their HFpEF, mid-range in HFrEF classifications, but then a greater focus on finding out the cause of the heart failure each of those conditions and also providing better access to the therapies. So I think some of the things we've discussed, some expansion of echocardiographic provision and of heart function specialist nursing teams to expand, to include HFpEF as well as HFrEF would all be important and probably achievable ways of doing that."
"Well then you're into, I mean, you're into, into the broader task of awareness, aren't you? So I think, I think the ability to test for natriuretic peptides in people who are breathless is pretty well developed now, that's, that's pretty good. The ability to offer echos to people with, with elevated natriuretic peptides is pretty good. I guess there's some work to do on awareness on new treatment options for HFpEF as they become available and the benefits that they can have."
"Some greater awareness of scoring systems would almost certainly be helpful for diagnosis as well, and some greater access to investigations for causes of HFpEF as well. I think you're sort of starting a big shift now towards people confirming or ruling out ATTR amyloid in suspected HFpEF because there are specific treatments options and probably will start to see that coming online for HFpEF, too. So I think there's certainly, certainly lots to be done. I think that in five years, you'll probably see the patient A get initiated on an SGLT2 inhibitor, maybe some other stuff. And then who knows, maybe they can get diagnosed a bit sooner than they did in these cases."
"Yeah, no, that's, that's been really great since you met very easy to follow. So thanks very much. And I hope I've been able to provide some, some honest and real world insights into this that I hope are valuable to your clients."
"Thanks a lot, same toward you. Have a great day."
"All right. We have the respondent on line. Diane, you can go ahead."
"Yes, I'm a respiratory consultant. I'm just mindful, you don't want me to say my name or where I work, so I work in a teaching hospital in Wales. The hospital I work at has about 250 medical beds. I look after a ward with the respiratory and general medical patients. I do a respiratory outpatient clinic. I do in fact three a week. I also do a private clinic as well."
My main interests are COPD airways disease and I run a primary rehabilitation unit.
"I diagnose it. I decide on inhaler choices. I'm responsible for patients as they come into hospital with an exacerbation. I provide an e-advice service for GPs where they contact me a lot regarding inhalers. I run the community COPD team. I get asked lots of questions about COPD patient management in that regard. Some of my private patients are COPD patients as well. So it's diagnosis, it's long term management, and it's treating exacerbations."
It ranges between probably 80 and 120 per month.
"Okay. Of course there's smoking cessation, as you've just said. There's making sure they have their winter flu vaccination. It's getting them onto a  inaudible 00:04:55  program, which I run. And in terms of medical therapy, there are three different algorithms we tend to go through. So for patients who are breathless, I start them on bronchodilators. For patients who I think may have asthma, as well as COPD I start an ICS LABA. And for people who are exacerbators or at high risk of exacerbations, I start them on triple therapies. Some patients who are more severe and some patients who don't respond as well to treatment, I put them forward for a possible lung volume  inaudible 00:05:37  and transplantation. And people who are frequent exacerbators, I sometimes treat them on prophylactic antibiotics."
"Yeah, sure. There's a lot of interference on the line. Is that me, or is that you?"
"It doesn't matter. There's a big whooshing sound every now and again. But that's  inaudible 00:06:21  not much a problem. So by frequent exacerbators, I mean, if a patients had a hospital admission with an exacerbation in the past year, so one severe exacerbation, or two moderate exacerbations in the last year. In other words, they've had antibiotics and or steroids with their GP twice or more in the last year."
"Right. So first of all, I need to tell you how much are on triple therapy."
"Out of that, how many are on fixed and how many are on-"
"Okay. So out of 100, I would say 75% are on triple. And after that 75, 50 are on fixed dose, and 25 are not."
"A lot of it is around convenience for the patient. A lot of it is around making sure that not having too many inhaler devices, isn't causing confusion, and isn't leading to inhaler errors. A lot of it is around cost saving by prescribing fixed dose triple therapy. There's a cost savings every year that can be made. The individual reps then talk me through what are the particular selling points for their particular inhaler, whether that's a GSK rep, or a AstraZeneca rep, or a  KAZ 00:08:24  rep."
"Usually, I'm asking a bit more detail about the data they presented, specific studies. Trying to get a better understanding. Is what they're saying representative and true? Or can it be taken with a pinch of salt?"
"Oh, dear. I know which drug company it is already, I'm afraid."
Yeah. I don't actually know what you're referring to. There's nothing there that shows-
Yes. COPD is a major healthcare burden and cause of mortality worldwide.
"So my takeaways are that usually when you're doing presentations to healthcare professionals highlighting the importance of COPD and why it should be at the forefront of every general physician and general practitioner's mind, you usually need quite a few slides in which to cover it, which can be a little arduous. But this actually covers it quite nicely in one slide. You can talk about different aspects. The under diagnosis, the readmission rates, the fact that the second commonness cause of an emergency admission. I think what's slightly less clear... I presume you want me to be critical?"
So the COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide. That picture illustration just above it slightly takes away from it. I would certainly have that larger and make it clear that the statement is very much describing what is inside of the circle.
"I think, have the circle bigger. And maybe have it in a different color. The only trouble is, is that the most important thing? And arguably actually I think it isn't when we're trying to get a message across."
"If I'm being completely honest, I don't think-"
"GP or a patient does not care a jot that COPD is third leading cause of death worldwide. I could tell that malaria is a major cause of death. It's not going to resonate with them. The things that resonate with people are the emergency admissions, the mortality following the admission to hospital with an exacerbation that isn't there. I think that's arguably the most important thing. Admission to hospital is very exacerbation is associated with the 50% mortality, and depending on what study three years, five years. So yeah, that resonates with me. That resonates with a clinician. The fact that half of patients are undiagnosed, that hugely resonates. But the bit about it being third leading cause of death worldwide, it doesn't, and it doesn't really mean anything to our clinicians."
"I'm going to say five, just because I think you have to include the hospital, the mortality data patients get admitted to hospital."
"Seven, it's very credible and it's very true."
"I'm going to give it a lower score. I'm going to say four. I think there are things in there that don't resonate with that enough, the most obvious being the mortality with a hospital admission exacerbation. I think that is missing in that slide."
"So again, this is presenting a worldwide view of COPD, showing that you've got a high mortality in certain countries than in others. And I'm sorry, I would skip over that slide. Again, that's meaningless to our clinicians. And to be quite frank, some of the data that some other countries collect is poor. I think on a UK basis, it's fine. It is important to know that social deprivation that's linked to smoking pollution. Bio mass fuel does increase the likelihood of being diagnosed with COPD and with worse outcomes. I think the worldwide figure is unhelpful. I think the UK figure is very helpful."
"Yeah, no, the data collected in other countries is nowhere near as robust as ourselves and Australia and the United States and Canada."
"Well, I think the trouble with some of those risk factors, particularly that raise cholesterol, it's an association rather than anything that's causative. Again, it's relevant, but not hugely. I'd rather talk about those issues when looking at comorbidities and other things that COPD patients have. If you're trying to give too many messages then things are going to be lost in translation. So I think the most important message there is that in your most deprived areas you are nearly five times as likely to have COPD, and the mortality rates are going to be higher. This is the reason why. So almost I would keep the Britain figure, and I would keep the rectangle at the top going exposure to environmental risk factors. The fact that they're associated with other health wise issues detracts from the message a little bit."
"Well, I'll give that a five, because I'm just not sure putting raise cholesterol is of any real relevance. So I'd give that a five for that reason."
"No, no. I mean, this is just giving a background about whether COPD is going to be more likely to occur."
"Yeah. This is a busy, busy slide. I'm not really fond of slides that have this much information in them. What I take from that, even though we think patients are either exacerbators or non exacerbators, that actually a very high proportion of patients at some point in a three year period are going to have an exacerbation."
"And then this has a knock on effect with reducing lung function, making patients more deconditioned, worsening the mental health, worsen their quality life, getting through a vicious cycle. Although I would slightly argue, and this will be reflected in my mark, that the evidence that it follows that particular vicious cycle where quality of life then influences a further COPD exacerbation is probably not backed up by a lot of evidence."
"But then the spiral is trying to, again, show causality. Then it's not really fair to call that a spiral. A spiral is when one thing leads to another leads to another. So that's implying that mental health reduces quality of life, but then reduced quality of life causes further CODP exacerbation. And that's not an accurate statement."
"Yeah, I agree completely that once COPD makes you more likely to have another exacerbation of COPD, that's fine. I wouldn't present it as a spiral in that case."
"I mean, if I'm being honest, I would take out physical deconditioning, mental health and quality of life. I would have them as different boxes as they get worse from a COPD exacerbation. I would make it COPD exacerbation, reduced lung function for the COPD exacerbation. And then consequences of that may be coming off the COPD exacerbation, reduced quality of life, reduced mental health and physical deconditioning."
"They're three very different studies, and three quite different results. I don't think you need to have three studies there. I think simply you can say Eclipse study, which was actually the best study in terms of looking at the natural history of COPD exacerbations. I would say up to 77% of patients have at least one moderate to severe exacerbation in three years. The Uplift trial and the Spiromics trial weren't necessarily geared towards looking at that, whereas I'd argue the Eclipse study was. I think you're actually detracting a little bit. I will just have the Eclipse study results there on their own."
"I agree. That's been referenced somewhere, and I'm not sure what that reference actually is."
"Yeah, absolutely. But actually, I think that gets lost. I think the slide is so busy that something that's actually quite important is getting lost in a busy slide. I would actually split that up, if I could, into two slides. Because you're giving three important messages there, and I think that's too much for one slide. I'd argue that even the fact that up to 78% of patients don't report their exacerbations, I think that's really important. I'd have that on its own."
"No, I'd say probably have two, but I think I'll elaborate on the unreported COPD. This is really important. If there's one thing that's going to make a clinician think about prescribing triple therapy it's the fact that actually I am under diagnosing some of these people's exacerbations."
"I would have one half of it talking about the Eclipse data that up to, 70% patients have at least one exacerbation. And I'd have a different form of the spiral where one exacerbation leads to another. And then I think, I would say in another slide I'd delve more into the non-reporting of COPD exacerbations. Because I think it's really important."
"I'm going to give that a three, just based on I don't agree with how the spiral's been illustrated."
"So I'd give that a seven. I think this is really important. And arguably it's too busy a slide. Like I said before, that should be two slides."
"No, it's all of it together. It's the whole package. The whole package."
"A lot of them are going to exacerbate, of those a significant number made not have even reported them and the consequences of exacerbations."
"Yes. I really like this. I really, really, really, really like this. This is a perfect illustration of why exacerbations are not good. But particularly it's in mild patients. My goodness gracious. If anything, would persuade you to start a patient on triple therapy earlier rather than later, it is this slide. Not only do you want to diagnose people earlier, which we should be trying to do anyway, but getting them started on medication and exacerbations. Yeah, this slide is for me perfect. I love it."
"It's saying that once you have an exacerbation you may not go back to baseline, you may have unrecoverable damage to your airways. So isn't it better to prevent rather than treat an exacerbation? So, yeah, it's very nicely, easily illustrated by the  inaudible 00:25:42  FEV1 that recovers a little bit. But you've lost 32 mills after that exacerbation that you will never recover. Shall I move on to the right side?"
"And then the right side, of all the patients that have significant reductions in their FEV1 and their lung function every year, it's the mild patients that have the catastrophic decline. If they're not treated or if they're not in adequate therapy or if they're not even diagnosed, you're going to end up over the period of five, 10 years losing a huge amount of lung function because you haven't prevented exacerbations."
"We don't know the reason for that. Are you starting off from a bigger baseline? Is there more variability? Once you've got a bigger lung function, is it percentage wise? But whatever it is, it's hugely, hugely symbolic and hugely important."
"Yeah, absolutely. If there's one slide that I would put right at the top, it would be this one."
"So again, a very effective, a very thought provoking slide showing that if you have one moderate exacerbation you're at risk of having a hospital admission. And if you have two moderate exacerbations your risk of death is significantly increased. So again, if anything, nothing can better illustrate the importance of treating and preventing exacerbations. And the Kaplan Mayer plots on the right hand side again shows the importance of that. People who have exacerbations are more likely than people who don't."
"Yes. Yeah, it is. I participate in the national COPD audit and it's what we see in our audit data as well."
"The 21% does. The 80% percent, I've got to say that I'm not so sure about that. And I'm not quite sure what study they got that from, and how they got that data. That's a bit shocking."
"Well, it is, yes. I'm not sure how they got that number and what they compared it to. If the rate is increased by then you are comparing it to something. I haven't come across that figure, but the 21% I have, and the other figures about 5% death and three... Sorry, five year death, three year death, I have come across."
"I'm going to give that a five, just because I'm not sure about the 80%."
"Yeah. So yeah, this is what I did my MD research in is cardiovascular events and COPD. Again, hugely important. Everybody thinks that people with COPD die of respiratory failure and pneumonia and things like that, but actually cardiovascular mortality is high. And it's even higher when you come into hospital. So this is really, really important. People are ignorant of it."
"Yeah. 20%, you're two times more likely to have a heart attack and there's a significant risk of a stroke in the days after being admitted with an exacerbation. Actually, no, it's not admission, is it? That's a moderate exacerbation. That means they're being treated in the community. So you'd imagine that the risk of stroke and heart attack, if you get admitted to hospital, is even higher."
"Well, you'd wonder what it would be in severe. I wonder, is it worthwhile having those figures side by side. I'm surprised at that, because usually the data I've seen on  inaudible 00:31:37  and strokes are after you get admitted to hospital. I suppose shock value. It is more effective because it says, well, if you're in a community of an exacerbation, your chance of a heart attack and the stroke are significantly increased."
"Yeah. Again, very pertinent to the high shock value. Excuse me."
"Absolutely. We were one of the first groups to demonstrate cardiovascular abnormalities in people with seemingly normal cardiovascular systems who had COPD. We demonstrated they had stiff arteries, and the worst the disease was the stiffer their arteries were."
That I see are the ones that have likely come through the hospital front door.
"Yeah. So comorbidity is very, very important. The more comorbidities you have, the more likely you are to die. Again, is that completely relevant to COPD exacerbations? I'm not sure that it is, because we know that with or without exacerbations, if you have COPD, you're more likely to have other comorbidities and actually comorbidities that are associated and perhaps even caused by COPD."
"I think they're not surprising. I think it's a very busy slide. Is it giving it a little bit too much information to an audience that it may not be... At the end of the day, sharing these slides, you want the slides to make people more likely to prevent exacerbations."
"I would probably just focus on ischemic heart disease and heart failure, because I think atrial fibrillation and diabetes, there's lots of other things we could put in there. But the things that are going to really increase mortality are COPD and heart failure and ischemic heart disease."
"Yeah, I think they're no brainer. They're obvious. But yeah, I think that they're important. Not necessarily for our COPD exacerbation message, but they are important in general."
"Well, be honest, I'm going to give that a four."
"There's nothing on there that would influence me majorly, because there isn't very robust evidence that COPD exacerbations will reduce your cardiovascular events and episodes of heart failure."
"Yeah. This is basically showing that cardiovascular death is common in COPD as being shown by a number of studies, which that slide nicely illustrates. Patients with moderate to severe are more likely to die of cardiovascular disease than patients with severe COPD. I think we're opening a can of worms there by putting that bit of the slide."
"Well, I think we are trying to imply that this is another reason to treat patients with moderate COPD. I think there are lots of other confounding factors with that. Personally, if I was presenting these slides, I'd find it slightly challenging. And in fact I would be challenged on that message."
"Yeah. I find it difficult to sell that message, to be honest, and to explain why that is. I think it's probably just because if you've got severe COPD you're more likely to get respiratory failure and die of the respiratory failure than you are to die of a heart attack. I don't know that particular study or where that data has come from, but I can't see the sense in it, if I'm being honest."
"No, that's very well known. That's been presented before. And that's very relevant."
"Okay. I'm going to give that a four, but not for the left hand side, but more for the right hand side."
"It's the causality. Reducing the frequency of the exacerbations have a direct knock on effect to cardiovascular mortality. I'm not sure we can honestly stand up and say that. I know some of the studies that one particular company is showing, but I think it's still early days yet for us to demonstrate that."
"It's what I did my research in. It's why do risk factors for COPD influence the cardiovascular system? And looking at why exacerbations do the same. So with exacerbations, you get all the systemic inflammatory response, the low oxygen levels, the high heart rate because of the exacerbation, all the medications we give you, and the load that puts on the heart. This is basically the pathophysiology of why people get cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular death."
Yeah. I think it's simple enough for healthcare professionals outside of a respiratory field to be able to understand. Yeah.
"Well, it's the person who's more interested in the pathophysiology. Your respiratory academic is more interested in the why, whereas your general practitioner is just interested in showing me what to do and give me a basic idea of why I'm doing what you're telling me what to do."
"The patients who at risk of exacerbation. We know that previous exacerbations predict future exacerbations. We know that the more severe disease you have, the more likely you are to have an exacerbation. And if you've got an eosinophil count and the debate about what the count has to be, but if it's raised and you're not on an inhaler or corticosteroid, then you're at greater risk of exacerbating."
"Probably the middle one, the breathless associated with a higher exacerbation risk. You could argue that actually those patients tend to present more and report more their exacerbations than the patients with more mild and moderate disease. Which is possibly the reason why they get under reported in that group."
Because we know that's from the Eclipse study and other studies that show that the best way of predicting future exacerbations is looking at past exacerbations.
Because there's really good data coming out now about the role of eosinophils.
"Not hugely, but if you're uncertain and that you're sitting on the fence one way or another, then it could sway you."
"Yeah. Everybody who would step inside a hospital would have a full blood count, which includes eosinophils."
"Well, it's just giving you a background. It's not having the consequences. Slides that have consequences of exacerbations are much more powerful than slides that tell you you're more at risk of having them if you had one before, or if you're more breathless, or you have a high eosinophil count. Well, that's really interesting, but the thing that's going to make you change your practice is the consequences. Previous slides have talked more about consequences than this slide."
"Yeah, a very powerful slide. Again, one of my favorites. Particularly the illustration on the right side is very, very elegantly done, showing that you start off with one exacerbation and things get worse. The time in between exacerbations get shorter and shorter and shorter as things get more and more severe. So, yeah."
"Just showing that the more exacerbations you have, the more likely you are to have exacerbations. Again, I know that slide well, and it's a very powerful message."
"So the more exacerbations you have, the more likely you are to have further ones. The one or more means you're getting quite a few possibly. No, I think that's pretty clear."
I think they go well together. I think they go nicely together and compliment each other. I would be in favor of keeping them together.
"Yeah. Why do people with more severe breathlessness get more exacerbations? I don't think this is that important. I think you could argue that, are they more likely to be reported in the more severe group because they just have much less reserve? Okay. Going back on what I said, It's important to show people that you can be pretty asymptomatic but still get exacerbations. It's reasonably obvious, I think."
"I don't think it adds an awful lot, I'm being completely honest with you."
"Well, I just think you can argue why that is that for other reasons. I don't think it's going to make people prescribe more."
"Yeah. This is what we were talking about before, a very good slide just showing that if you've got high eosinophil counts and you are treated in ICS, you're much less likely to get an exacerbation. Whereas, if you've got high eosinophil counts then you're more likely to get an exacerbation if you're not treated with an ICS. So yeah, very important, very powerful."
"It is by respiratory physicians, not so much by people in primary care."
"No, I think the trouble is it's difficult for primary care to be told, look at their eosinophil count. Because, in truth, you're going to go for exacerbation history first of all to help make the decision. And certainly if you're in two minds that I would really advocate looking at the eosinophil count. I think it's very interesting for us. I just always find primary care, it's too much of a fuss and a hassle to check a full blood count and then bring the patient back and what have you."
"For me personally, a seven. Primary care, I would imagine would be different."
"Yeah. I'm not a fan of this slide. It's busy. It's not getting, I think, the point across perfectly. I know it's trying to say get away from the stepwise approach, but it doesn't really illustrate that wonderfully well, particularly because it's got the other half, the right half, making the slide a lot more difficult to read and appreciate."
"I think there's a lot on the left hand side, and I think it is illustrating something that's relevant, but it's difficult to read, particularly with the exacerbation and the unreported exacerbation. I think that the message is harder to get across because it's such a busy slide."
Don't wait for things to happen. Make patients treated earlier. Don't wait for deterioration.
"I'd elongate it, because the people presenting that slide can then explain a little bit more eloquently why waiting for things to happen isn't a good idea."
"I think that's been covered in previous slide. We know that. We know if you don't give them treatment they're going to be at high at risk of exacerbating. That again is not going to influence a GP. Whereas, trying to get out the stepwise approach, getting them on to either triple therapy or dual bronchodilators early is the right thing to do."
"I'm going to give that a five, because I'm not sure how much that's based on data or that's just a pictorial representation."
"Yeah, I don't like it. Very busy. Very piggledy, piggledy. Yeah, it's just too busy."
"I mean, really what you want is to take each box at a time. And the optimum management is on rehab smoking cessation and pharmacological therapy. The other bits just make it a too busy a slide and detract from the important point."
"That's really important because if people aren't diagnosed they're not treated and they're losing their 80 mills of FEV1 per year, particularly if they're exacerbating."
That's basically how you assess which pharmacological therapy you put patients on because of their exacerbation risk.
"I think that's a moot point. As long as they have some sort of follow up, it doesn't always matter whether that's in primary care, secondary care or even the community."
"I think it would fit better... I suppose it's trying to be a summary slide, isn't it?"
"But for me, I'd want to focus on the optimum management aspect of it. I think the others detract. Because we've talked about all the others so far."
I'm not really sure where the percentages come from.
"Smoking cessation seems low and probably rehab seems high. I don't think the evidence is there that you say you've got a 40% reduction primary rehab. In more times, if you do primary rehab, because I think there's a huge case selection by us there. Because you're much more likely to do primary rehab program if you're less at the end stages of life. I wouldn't put those numbers in personally."
"Particularly with the primary rehab data, you can be accused of not using meaningful percentages and results."
I'll give that a four based on that primary rehab bit.
I think they are a very good set of slides. I think they need a little bit of tweaking here and there.
"They're trying to say get patients onto treatment that can prevent exacerbations and you'll improve their mortality, their quality of life, their admissions to hospital, and the decline in their lung function."
"Yeah. I think that the slide that showed the decline in FEV1, if you've got mild disease with an exacerbation, is hugely powerful."
I think the biggest challenge is getting a diagnosis because we don't have access to spirometry.
"There's nothing better than triple therapy at reducing exacerbations. There's nothing better at improving your mortality. If you're in two minds, the patients who've got high eosinophil counts, there's even more reason to put them on triple therapy or an ICS containing therapy. And in terms of cardiovascular events, that slide didn't show enough detail as to whether the changes are statistically significant between groups. And it showed that actually triple therapy and ICS LABA were comparable and reducing cardiovascular events."
They work very nicely side by side. You've got the story at the beginning. And then you've got the evidence showing you that triple therapy out trumps ICS LABA and LAVA LAMA in terms of its outcome.
"I think it leads very nicely, and is highly supportive of that."
"I think it's exacerbators, but arguably I'd say the biggest unmet need will be the patients with milder disease who are still at risk of exacerbation."
It's that slide showing the deteriorations.
It is different because these patients are just not getting diagnosed because it's so much harder to get spirometry done.
"I would explain how to assess the risk of exacerbation. I would explain the consequences of exacerbations. I would then show the data supporting treatment to prevent exacerbations and the knock down effect that has for important outcome measures, like mortality and cardiovascular events."
"I think there is something missing, and that is I think a slide around difficulty diagnosing an exacerbation, and differentiating an exacerbation with chronic symptoms."
"Other than the specifics comments I've made about the slides, I would just say, bear in mind that diagnosing an exacerbation is not always straightforward. I think that needs to be put across in any presentation."
Because at the end of the day it's a subjective diagnosis. It's a patient symptom led diagnosis rather than a test.
" inaudible 01:10:50 . I was sure those slides were GSK slides, but there we are."
"The newest thing is the FEV1 story, the decline in the mild patients. I know that's a AstraZeneca slide because I've seen that before."
"It wouldn't fill me with horror. It's just time is quite tight for one reason or another. But yeah, it's the sort of thing medical liaison people would sit down and make me go through."
"Well, depends how much time I've got. They try to, yeah."
"So yeah, somebody that has a known diagnosis of COPD, with..."
" inaudible 00:00:49 . Yeah, hang on a minute. How is that?"
"So moderate exacerbation, usually where the patient requires steroids and/or antibiotics, but doesn't usually require a hospital admission. Severe exacerbation probably usually requiring hospital admission."
"Oh right, okay. I think we're in business."
"Well, it's quite unusual really. I think I prefer a stepwise approach for a number of reasons. So usually ICF-lABA or LAMA-LABA, and then escalate to a triple therapy. I think if a patient has demonstratively severe lung function, usually with an FEV one less than 50% and has exacerbated at least once in the previous year, then I would consider maybe initial treatment with a triple therapy, but always with an eye on trying to reduce the amount of molecules the patients taking."
"Yeah, sure. I know it's usually that with what we do. So I'm a consultant respiratory physician in a busy Northwest teaching hospital, special interest in airways, severe COPD and asthma."
"I'm a bit tongue and cheek, as you know, with shorts of space I shouldn't be tongue cheek, no. So differences between the three are mostly posology. So Trimbo is BB trolology and Trixeo are once a day. Trixeo has good signals in the studies for mortality improvement, as does trologoy, which Trimbo does not have. So essentially, they're the same but slightly different with mortality improvement in Trixeo and possibly Trology."
"I think they're probably, in terms of efficacy, so time to first exacerbation, severity of exacerbations, number of exacerbations, I suspect they're all pretty much the same. I've seen good data for all of the products. The only metric, which is extremely interesting is the mortality data, as I say."
"Well, there's only been one or two studies previously, which have hinted at an improvement in mortality with pale therapy, but nothing to the extent of trology and Trixeo. They seem to have, certainly Trixeo, certainly seems to have very good mortality data. If we can get an inhaler that stops our patients with COPD dying, then that's clearly very good."
I'm quite tempted to go and get my Air pods. Do you think Air pods would be any better?
"Yeah, am I if memory of the pathology is incorrect, I thought Trixeo was once a day, but it suggested it's two puffs, twice a day, fair enough. The mortality data is compelling. It's concerning that it's best differentiation is between LAMA-LABA, which is my preferred initial starting COPD medications after the study on Alltbro, flame study I think it was. The exacerbation data is typically underwhelming and so the headline figure of 50% is good, but that only equates to half an exacerbation a year. The hospitalization data again is pretty poor, really, 0.15 to .13 of a hospitalization really is clinically irrelevant. I appreciate the 20% and the 18%, but those are what lots of the studies in the health therapy show in any case, so..."
"Yeah, the presentation was good, it was factual. It was a bit boring, actually a bit basic, a bit black and white with very little movement or... I think it was just very much, as it was, I know the data surrounding hospitalization and death following a first exacerbation and milos and that sort of thing. And so yeah, it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. As I say it reminded me of the posology. I think the delivery from the video was a bit dry, but that's the only criticism I had."
"Well, that's a good question too, because at the start you suggested that we may use triple therapy as a first initial therapy, but the indications and the presentation suggests that it's indicated for those patients already on dual therapy."
"So, that fits in with my current prescribing's that I would use it in dual therapy patients."
"No, I think we've embraced triple therapy pretty much in our region, probably across the country. It makes sense for a whole load of reasons. The mortality data is compelling. If a patient knew the mortality data and they were on Trology or even worse Trimbo, I think they'd be pretty unhappy."
"Yeah, I understand that question, but there wasn't anything in the presentation that would make, that would make me want to do that. The presentation was very much geared around, step up from dual therapy and comparison with dual therapy, not comparison with single therapy or no therapy."
"So they, to any extent, suggest that I should do that or would."
"Oh, it's how trilogy, I mean, all of the inhaler therapies have exactly the same blurb, how bad an exacerbation is, what an exacerbation is. Then we can reduce exacerbations often by very similar numbers to Trixeo. So the sort of stuff that I've seen is completely, yeah, par for the course is what I've seen lots of times before."
"Fine. So if it's encouraging me to use, encouraged me to use earlier as a one, there's nothing there that wanted me to make it used earlier, one."
"Just the mortality data, that's highly motivating."
"That's a six. So it has the same pathology as Trimbo, but possibly different. Well, it is different to Trology and Trology has similar, but not as good mortality data. I can't remember what the data is, but I know it's not quite as good. So it's similar to Trology, not as good."
"Basically, it says Trixeo improves all cause mortality when compared to LAMA-LABA, presumably in fear, BD only, and that's a huge message."
"Yeah, so the problem is that's probably not accurate and those are numbers needed to treat or numbers needed to harm, which we're quite okay with statistically. I think most people are, well, I certainly am, more visual. I like the Kaplan Meier Curve rather than the statement. The statement, it presumably is statistically true, I haven't done the math. But the statement, I think dilutes, I mean, it doesn't sound as impressive as a 50% reduction in all mortality's."
"It is the same thing, but I think it dilutes the message some what."
"Yeah and that the whole point about the numbers need to stream versus cap the math. So this one is less impactful for me. We're used to seeing deaths and outcomes as a Kaplan Meier Curve. So a simple number is less impactful. I think the graph in the number is good. I know that the ABPI says that you have to say that statements are true. So Trology does have mortality signals, but maybe it's because it wasn't a pre-specified secondary endpoint. Maybe it was some ad hoc analysis or post hoc with Trology."
"It's got the numbers needed to treat in a slightly different way. For me, if the numbers needed to treat well, one best for every 20 patients that was mind blowing. I'm not sure where it stops becoming mind blowing and starts to become a little less dilute. Maybe 50, more than so one death for every 80 patients. Although having said that, you know, I think the way that you, the way that you present that data is important. So if you said you have 80,000 patients in your region, then you can prevent 1000 deaths."
"Now that is, you know, that's a better way of sharing that data."
"Well nothing, we come with a very low expectation in inhaled therapy for mortality, because nobody has shown this sort of data before, nobody's shown a mortality improvement. So you don't have any expectation."
"But this, like you must have realized that as soon as we started talking about comparisons between triple therapy, the big thing about Trixeo is it's mortality benefits. So I'm aware of it and we are excited about it. It just looks better, 49% reduction than one for 80."
"When I say I prefer it, I say it's more impactful, the Kaplan Meier Curve. Because the numbers needed to treat is the same as the Kaplan Meier. It's just derived from that, isn't it? So, you know, it's the same data, but as I say, 50% sounds better than one in 80."
"But if you're trying to sell this, if this is marketing, then that's what I would say. The only way to make the numbers need to seem more impactful is by spreading it across the region. And to be fair, you know, we could easily have 4,000, 8,000 patients in a reasonably average sized location with COPD. So once you expand numbers needed to treat, which I know is not how numbers needed to treat work, but you could reasonably display it to that. Then it would be a lot more impactful."
"So immediately it's a bit too, it's a bit too complicated and I'll have to look at it, you know, to mean. The Kaplan Meier Curves, you look at them, that's immediately fine. So this is not overly clear. I would imagine these are all Trixeo treated patients. Is that correct?"
"No, I don't think so. What I think, what it's trying to show is that we talk about secondary prevention in carjack studies all the time. Those four studies on the right, presumably are not Trixeo to the patients. They are studies in cardio protection and look at the poor risk reduction in those versus the amazing risk reduction we're getting in Trixeo. But, that slide will require a discussion and talking to or the viewer reading it carefully before deciding that."
Is the original the one on the left? That is the original?
"To be honest, for me, I think the Kaplan Meier, the old MC, mother Charlie is probably more impactful for me. We're used to looking at mortality data in cancer, on a Kaplan Meier basis and so that is instantly recognizable."
"No, mother Bravo, it is factually correct, but the way that it is, visually does not appeal to me at all."
"And they're all MC, differentiates from other close, prefer the MC."
So second all goes to original M and third goes to alternate MB.
"It's all appealing, as to say, the only thing I don't like is the flat line about the numbers needed to treat."
"I think that, as I say, still violates the message."
"Exacerbations are bad. This is common, well known well-established data."
"Yeah, I was going to say it's very similar."
"Yeah, so UC is less visually impactful. I like the visuals of the other one. I appreciate this is similar. I appreciate the effect on mental health. that is interesting that doesn't occur in the first slide, but just the way that the slide is organized, isn't as visually appealing for me as the original."
"I'm not sure if I like this or not really. Originally I didn't like it, I do like the idea of a downward spiral and a downward progression and it seems to fit in nicely with a story, talking about mortality, but visually it's not appealing. I think it's a bit too complicated. It's understood that this is what happens. I think it's implicit. I think I prefer the original actually."
"Visually it's yeah, visually it's very similar to UC and I don't really like UB or UC. I like UD, it is okay. But I think the original for me is the winner here."
"It's similar to UC, it's a PowerPoint slide and it's an instant turnoff. It is a factual presentation of facts and it is not appealing."
I think it probably just needs a revamp. I agree with everything on all of the slides. I think the visuals just need typing up.
"So for me, UC is the one that's better visually appealing because it starts to mention mental health and anxiety and depression, which are nice guidelines in COPD."
"UC would be, if it was a visually better."
"Okay. So the top bit, no. No, this doesn't work for me. I appreciate the best bit is the bottom of note."
"The answer is yes, if it was better visualized."
It's a mess to look at. I appreciate what they're trying to do.
"Because the content is more, the content is wider ranging and more appropriate and leads nicely into the rest of the story, which an improvement in mortality."
Okay. So increased urgency to treat is the modified UC.
"Probably UD, but the problem is they talk about COPD and the round rather than inhaled therapy specifically. So UD, if I had to pick one."
"Yeah. So two is alt UD, Delta, uniform Delta for both. So 2, 2, 1 as you go down the column."
"Modified, sorry, original U is three, three."
"So yeah, differentiation. Yeah, you can put down the same."
"It improves hospitalizations, but the numbers are extremely modest."
"You know, this is 0.2 and has an exacerbation a year. I would not show this data. I don't think."
"It's 0.2 of an exacerbation a year. That's one exacerbation every 50 years. This is, you know, for a statistician, this is really quite poor data, plus it's not even significant versus LAMA-LABA. It is significant just versus LABA-ICF."
"But even so it's like one exacerbation every 33 years. I mean, just bonkers, you don't see that. I mean, this is bonkers."
"Yeah, this is misleading, but it's better. In fact, this is much better. I mean, it's not misleading because the data is the same, I appreciate that. But it looks visually better, of course. And I like the numbers needed to treat are much more attractive."
"Oh, good. Right, okay. Well, that's a combination of both of them, isn't it? That does absolutely nothing for me. The second one is probably the best. There's too much information on the slide. The absolute reduction in exacerbations is negligible at best and non-significant."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a busy slide, but the numbers are better and significant, so yeah. That's probably the best way of projecting this data."
"So the data in the, I think the second iteration, is the best. It made it look more impactful."
"There's too much data on the slide. Also, it's the data that makes the product look inferior by showing the absolute risk, the absolute reduction. So every time somebody shows me 40 or 50% reduction, I always ask the absolute anyway, but the headline figures look better when they're expresses a percentage rather than absolute."
"Left side. The data on the right hand side is ridiculous. Like we said already, you know, it's tiny fractions of exacerbations, but the numbers needed to treat one in 30 or whatever and the absolute 60 versus 20 is better projected like that."
"Well, it's the same data, but slightly better."
"Because it's got the number in, so the 20% or the 64 or the numbers the needed to treat are the magic here, the absolute risk reduction is not the magic."
It's very effective. The histogram is much better than the hospitalization.
"It has exacerbation data. It has exacerbation rates per year, which is quite good. So from one exacerbation every two years, versus LAMA-LABA, it's not quite as good versus ICS-LABA, but it's good and it's better. 52% reduction is better than most inhaled therapy studies."
"Yeah, it personalizes it and it makes it relevant to Trixeo. It links the 52 with Trixeo and makes it compelling in a way that the first slide did not."
"Okay, yeah. This is, I don't like comp, okay not slides, but yes, Trixeo transformations good. 52% good. Linked to Trixeo and then Trixeo versus LAMA-LABA. Yes. Numbers need to treat as three, now that's very compelling. That's very good data."
"Because one pheno treating three patients and preventing one exacerbation is very good. That's a very low numbers needed to treat. That's what the name of the game is, at least in this game."
"Yeah, no, you're right. It is. It's lower than I expected. Of course, you know, you could work it out, given a pencil and paper based on the exacerbation data. But seeing it like that and having it worked out for you is much more compelling than one in 80 or one in 3000. That's quite good data. That's, I like, that is impactful."
"Alt-EA. No, for me, EA, no. EC yes. A hundred percent."
"Column. Original, yeah, original E is two all the way down."
"Hang on a minute. Well, if you put two, then three for motivation for E."
"And then three, because it doesn't mention Trixeo."
"Okay. Yeah, so for me, not overly keen on the data presented like this. The data on the right hand side should be on its own slide, but it's good data. It would take a bit of understanding, but we're used to this sort of diamond plot. And so-"
"You know, no, it's not, it's not valuable based on what we've seen already, no."
"Because it's complex and irrelevant and it talks about stuff that we don't really talk about. Exacerbation history, exacerbation reductions. We don't really focus on it. There is no point to this slide. There's no driver saying, you know, this is what the data is, what are you going to do about it? So for me, it's not motivational, the data is irrelevant. You know, I don't think the data like this is necessarily useful for directing."
"Well, that's not what the, that's only half the data. It's, we've seen that already. So the other half of the data is about exacerbation reductions that weren't driven by a history of exacerbations. I mean, it's Goble-gloop, it doesn't really mean much to me at all. As a practicing physician, the data on the left I understand I get, the data on the right I don't think is relevant."
Now how can you reduce exacerbations in somebody who doesn't exacerbate?
"Yeah, but they don't exacerbate these populations. They don't exacerbate."
"I think, I mean I kind of get what they're trying to show, but they've shown, you know, the data does not portray for me in an accurate or meaningful way, what you're trying to show."
"Yeah, I think this is difficult data to understand. These are patients that don't exacerbate, your predicting future exacerbations and showing Trixeo reduces exacerbations. I don't know. I think it's a slightly, it doesn't fit well, clinically. Patients are either frequent exacerbators or infrequent or not exacerbators, depending on the phenotype of COPD. For me, I don't think this sort of data resonates. I know what you're trying to show, but the data doesn't show in a meaningful way, what you're trying to portray."
"Yeah, so probably a five to six for urgency to treat, seven and seven. So it, the nice four slide data pack, the data is compelling. It's relevant, it is good data and stuff that is clinically meaningful, and it's put across in a meaningful way. I think that it is a good story."
"It doesn't because the data isn't there, but the data may be, the data may be included and it was easily discussed in a meeting then yes, I would be happy. But I think it sells itself on what we've discussed already."
I think the pre-exacerbation data is icing on the cake. It is a good drug and it has good data.
"So I would, yeah. Focus on the fact that Trixeo, maybe the third closed therapy on the market, but it's certainly worth the wait. The data speaks for itself. We have extremely good mortality data, suggesting all cause mortality reduction, which none of the others do. W have decent exacerbation data suggesting that treating free patients with Trixeo, one exacerbation. I would argue that the data speaks for itself."
I'm good. Doing very well. How are you doing? Thank you.
"I mean, well, let's see... Do we give what's what study and all those things, or just, I start with them. Usually they go with that issue the more..."
I'm a primary care internist with the pulmonary specialization and also a researcher.
"Well, I mean, we are COPD in general. My clinic itself is a multi-specialty hospital, with multiple satellite clinic is large organization. So we see 200, 300 patients, COPD and asthma, and any airway diseases. So COPD itself, I would say anywhere between 100 to 200 patients total, all the clinic, not just me, we have multiple specials and primary care. So I would say a hundred plus patients, yes."
I am a practitioner with more assigned to department head. So mostly my roles are any of the primary care referrals in advanced COPD or any advanced error diseases. So I assigned roles as specialist for most of the primary care docs who would refer me and also I have my own primary care patients. So some of them come directly.
"I mean, it's depends on the disease classification and chronicity and also flareups and things like that. So the initial treatment is always, or always there should be bronchodilators, which it can be a short acting or long acting, I think be agonist or anything. And then depends on the patient's long term quality of life slash long term disease progression. We add multiple steroid combinations there, or different newer medications, long acting mask and cadence, things like that. There are different alternate treatment to the first line bronchodilators and steroids. Yeah."
"If they have in a multiple server version and C server versions, a big thing, innovation, get the cold or things like that. They can get the flare. So if somebody has multiple flares a year, if somebody has several disease burden, you had to treat with multiple antibiotics and things like that, then you go with the combination therapy."
"If they have like more symptomatic, severe, symptomatic, high risk of exacerbation in those goals to ease the disease burden and the quality of life. So one of those things. Symptom control again, prevent from flares, multiple flares and then also you had to look the patient's other core comorbidities and clinical status. You don't want to put on multiple medications with side effects on this patients either. So it's multifactorial."
Mostly the advanced newly approved medications and studies. So it's easier than the multiple medications we used in multiple polypharmacy things. So it's now in the triple therapy and so it's more kind more convenient slash more reserve and that's prob pretty much they're focusing on.
"I mean, it's mostly a newly newer maths, newly approved newly in research. So it's always, you wait and see cost just about any new products. So many of them don't last because of the side effects or not so much like in the clinical studies and real time users, you're not getting that much results. So it's always, you wait for a phase four or a real time clinical data after usage, things like that. So it slowly you observe and see what works so it's always cautious approach."
"Okay. Okay, let me check.  inaudible 00:11:24 ."
"I mean, it's the second most ER, or third most duty cost worldwide. That's a big deal."
"I would say half of the patients here would be undiagnosed. I mean, it's more, you're looking at the world. It's a different population than U.S. so it's a huge number."
"I would go the second most, and third most is more highlighted up. I mean,   00:12:28 "
"Right. I would start from that first, third leading cause that's a catch."
It's very relevant. I would do like six to seven.
I'll go with that five and a half. It's always prevention is better than cure.
"I mean, that's a big resource burden for hospitals and patients itself. So it's very true and it's very deceased burden financial burden."
"Say it means undiagnosed. Okay. Again, the numbers are the worldwide comparing to U.S. data and population. It's very different. So other countries there're a lot of other sources for COPD versus we are mainly from smoking."
"I mean, it's the reason why it's 50 percentage undiagnosed is either the low socioeconomic status. It's a big thing in the exposure of the major factors where it's in different countries. So, that's really important."
"No, I just, I had the thing, the phone to have a break for a second. Confusing it's that stats, the big numbers, usually all the stats really, the map and all that thing usually don't... I mean, it's not confusing, but age standard mortality rate, I would rather have like one consulted number that's..."
"It's more like the exposure factors, smoking, pollution. That's big, big, clearly interest there. I mean, in different parts of the world it's very, but in general, those are the three things."
"Of course, of course. I mean, like I said, I used the word comorbidity. That's a very important issue here. Like some people, diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol, high being like these are, it's only like enhanced the disease an it's a treatment burden there. So it's, I would say that definitely I need to address there."
"I mean, that slide do that C pretty chart itself. It's a  inaudible 00:22:02  functions go down because we like to... Yeah, so that's more like we had to add more stuff to it, but that's more relevant."
"I mean, you already mentioned all the demographic and stats there in the first slide, so at least one more of it, yeah."
Okay. One more time ma'am? Always I can't hear.
" inaudible 00:23:05  So yeah, 50 to 78%  inaudible 00:23:09  exacerbation are not even reported. That's a huge number, 80 percentage don't report. I don't know what does stats comes from."
"No. I mean, I far phrase that number. That's a high number, so I mean, we have every exacerbation reported, so we have, I would say 80% reported 80 plus small reported. So that's the worst number."
"Or any primary centers in any ER, settings. Things are always reported. This should be worldwide data in other countries. So maybe..."
"No, again, that's 4.5 since number is very...?"
The leading lung functions declining in  inaudible 00:26:06  moderate.
"I mean, it's a function decline. That's the whole point. Your FC, I know goes more medicine. It's FC on FCV ratio. That's a lung function decline. If that a plastic finding from a spirometry finding. So it's a lung function decline in almost mild to moderate CVSC produce. So that's very... Yeah, information you're giving out."
"I would separate split that slide. I would, especially the function would be more relevant than is saying that exacerbation reduced the form level. I mean, to me that second graph is more relevant. So I'll just focus on that in one slide."
So I missed that question. Say that again.
Declining. Yeah. Declining. So I would say six.
"Key takeaway, the risk of that increased within a year. That's a big burden."
"I mean the hospitalized increased, the numbers are no, I don't know. That's really accurate number, but I mean, I would go with everything except that."
The two more exacerbation that's in one year.
"Or I would, if it's more education purposes, the P value is highly significant in that slide. Yeah."
"Slide G, okay. It is cardiac  inaudible 00:31:39  So is that the two similar one comparison?"
"I mean, that Cardiovascular events, we compare in one... That slide is more relevant. The cardiovascular events which include the, I mean, cardiovascular and cardiovascular, the stroke and MI. So that tend to be more relevant than the other."
"Yeah, I mean, yeah. It's about increases for MI and stroke in total five to 10 within the 10 days that's very relevant and important."
"I mean, any cardiovascular risk, the comorbidity, any cardiovascular comorbidity is the risk of the mortality is high. So it's a long failure slash heart failure. So that's important on the level the box is, so that's very relevant. Then it break down the numbers, each cardiovascular, how much is the risk, but overall, cardiovascular comorbidity increases at the basic standard line up there."
"I don't know, maybe... I can't say I can't tell."
"Yeah, the presence of cardiovascular  inaudible 00:36:20  increased the risk for mortality in all COPD."
"I mean, that's basically summarized each event. It's the heart disease versus  inaudible 00:36:40  then heart failure. That's pretty much all cardiovascular. So they summarized, but diabetes also added, which is closer to that thing."
"Both are okay. But I would, again, focus on that wording there, moderately, slightly to die from cardiovascular disease."
"Is that the data from the trials, toll and uplift?  inaudible 00:38:02  yeah. I mean, I can't tell anything there."
"It's very relevant because cardiovascular itself as high mortality as the number two cause, I mean, number one cause. So when you add COPD into that mix that makes the patient with both increasing to 10, so..."
I mean it's lot of confusing with the goal stage when we either or not do know what is goal stage two and stage three and four.
"I mean, I'm asking, it's the criteria for symptoms...?"
"It's confusing there. What is gold? What is the other side, left side is let us do euro scope, those are clinical trial names versus this one is your clinical standard gold. So it there's no clear convention to... So folks know, or they're not the specialty. They have no idea. So that's confusing."
"It's pretty basic. I mean, if it's like a little bit literature search and physiology, you'd add more like, what do you say, inflammation mechanism there, how you hyperemia test. So little bit more path office added there. I mean, they mentioned, but these are commonly causing, but the middle portions would be added with more path office. How the inflammatory markers work from excess acceleration, which lead to cardiac. I mean, it's there, it's very lame and simple to the same, but any of the SLS go path office, it's going to be a huge slide with multiple steps."
Yeah. I would do the increase. Yeah. The first one passes just feel pretty
"I mean, it's okay. It's not that super great, but it's pretty basic."
"I mean, the first one may be a little bit... But it's a common statement, but that last letters didn't say my special is based ISAL counts. Not one I see and higher risk of are waiting that's yeah. That itself affects the management or anything treatment for that, from that statement."
Okay.  inaudible 00:45:18  okay. All right. All done. What's the question?
"It's this is exacerbation, that first one, the previous history, multiple exacerbation, they still had a high risk"
"Yeah.  inaudible 00:46:49  Yeah. I mean, I don't know what base I can take back compared to the other one.  inaudible 00:46:59  Yeah, that's true. But that won't change the outcome."
"I mean, it's could pretty clear and the graph is showing the same thing as the description on top."
"It's  inaudible 00:49:35  levels. So which the last thing you look into, but I mean it's... Yeah."
"Another treatment protocol basically, stepwise approach."
When it's disease progression or what type of treatment one in the different groups.
"Well, the second slide, it didn't have much like the first one. It's basically a number saying this would be the number for  inaudible 00:51:30 "
"Combination of freedom approaches, but it's a good slide. That's basic slide, but that's well, suggestion, problem. Rehab, pharmacological treatment, sub categorized.  inaudible 00:53:12 "
"Maybe more, I don't know. It's totally... Yeah. I guess I would say it's fine."
"I mean, it's more different, different things they're saying. It's treatment scale, severity, comorbidities, other cardiac event. So it's all different, different scales. And not really one is similar to that. Every slide is different.  inaudible 00:54:54 "
"I mean, yeah. I can go a little bit detail to one of the eosinophils things, which is maybe rather than that...   00:55:42 "
"No, no. If it's an immigrant or somebody with prior eosinophilic disease, like parasite,  inaudible 00:56:05  you think something rare things? They, I mean, if in a different third world or something is a very important thing, lung, flu parasites, those things cause more underlying that's a comorbidity which can version. So other than that is eosinophilic per se you produce a useless number that won't change any management or anything."
"Well, what's the question you asking now?"
"Oh, yeah. Like I thought you asked why, so."
"No, no, no, no. I was like, oh, where's that? Okay. Yeah. Yeah."
Okay. All right.  inaudible 00:58:39  okay.
"I mean, it's a good. I don't know what kind of studies it's whatever trial it is, it's RCT or any trial. That kind of data is marketable.That's where do want it from any product compared to all the other. With our group, it's start primary endpoints are, this is whatever it is, then multiple, second endpoint, like this eosinophilic cardiovascular comorbidities, all have significance with compared to the placebo or compared to the other groups. So it's a very significant product."
I would say moderate or severe disease symptoms.
"Again, same. I can't clearly answer that question until it's a non drug or approved drug. So then that decision comes, but with that data out there definitely I'm really to try for a moderate group of patients."
"Other comorbidity is cardiovascular for more British things like that. So multiple comorbidities cardiovascular, they already have multiple surveys, tried other groups. So since it's all the primary end goals and secondary and goals are higher fee value, it's definitely beneficial."
"I mean, there, there significant good slides. I mean, they show a clear difference. So they're,  inaudible 01:01:37 "
"No, no. I said it said it's good presentation with all that data points, different end points. So to me, it's a relevant data."
"Oh, in this four only one stay the four. Is that what you're saying?"
"All right. Clearly. So this group, the first A will stay, B will stay, definitely not C. I mean, it can add one of the demographics for the B, but I'm not, might find much benefit in the C."
"Right, right. I mean, I will say all the story there."
"Yeah. That's only L and M again. J it's there. I mean, that's only path is there. I would make a little bit more picture, add steps, but otherwise J is fine."
"I mean, the business burden, the the mortals and morbidity 3D it clearly say with this newer drug, whatever, triple they all aspects, all endpoints are meeting with this medication."
"Yeah, that's what pretty much to  inaudible 01:08:35  product will beneficial in multiply points."
W I'll keep. What's the first one? V and maybe Y.
"I would like to know about the data else will study, whereas it's a randomized control trial, or possible control trial, et cetera, et cetera. And clearly side effects because the endpoints and second endpoints are there, but in the duration, what's the maximum duration they studied things like that?"
"I'm the respiratory lead for my practice. I'm also the educational lead for the practice. They're my two main areas, I'd say. Yep."
"I'd say a good half are mild, maybe moderate 20%. No, maybe another quarter. And then fairly bad, maybe another 10%. And then really bad, maybe another 10%."
"Okay, well... So, including both categories, probably about a quarter."
"So, well, again, the triple inhaler... That's sort of further down the line, if people are struggling. I'll often add, say, a breathless inhaler, a LAMA, to a double steroid and LABA inhaler. I guess I got... Yeah."
"Rather than... Yeah. Yeah. The open triple. Some people will be on the LABA/LAMA, and I wouldn't generally add steroids to them as an open triple. I'd move them onto a triple inhaler."
"It might be a trigger, such as they've been in hospital with an exacerbation. Or maybe that they've told me about an exacerbation they had, for which I've treated them. Or it may be an annual review, when we've talked about how they've been doing. I think that would be about it."
"Okay. Well, it would depend partly on their age. So, let's assume they're an older patient, where COPD or chronic lung disease is reasonably likely or possible. So, I'd want to make sure that they don't have cardiovascular problems, such as..."
"Well, I'll be looking at chest pain and cardiac risk factors. And indeed, any risk factors. But if they're a longterm smoker, maybe they've had asthma in the past, as well, that'd be increasing the probability of COPD. So, I'd want to do a chest x-ray, an ECG would be a good idea. I'd probably do a range of blood tests, just to see if there's something simple, like anemia, as well."
"I'd want to, assuming they weren't critically short of breath, dangerously short of breath, I wouldn't be admitting them. But then I'd be arranging some kind of followup, with review of results, in two or three weeks."
"Yeah, that's one. Hypertension, obesity, family history, other medical problems, say, rheumatoid arthritis, things like that. Alcohol, occupational history maybe."
"No, I'd probably assume lung, first of all But I wouldn't want to miss cardiovascular, particularly if they're quite elderly. I could be thinking, ""Is this heart failure?"" Being reasonably probable  inaudible 00:08:22  with them   00:08:24 "
"For someone elderly, I probably would. Yeah. I might do a BNP blood test. An x-ray may well show up both, or one or the other. It could easily show up heart failure, enlarged heart, maybe some edema in the lungs. ECG is a simple test that I would ask our nurses to do quite early on."
"If it was a 60-year-old person who didn't have chest pain, and it was more that they were getting more wheezy, coughing, I probably wouldn't be thinking cardiac, really. I'd be going down the long route now."
"If it's more cardiovascular, rather than lung disease?"
"So, if there's any risk they've actually had a heart attack or ongoing issues, maybe I'd want to get an exercise test. That would entail a cardiac referral, because they do that on the basis of a referral. And if it's someone older and it does seem likely that they've got heart failure, then I can normally manage that. I'd get an echo to be sure, but they don't necessarily need a referral, as such. We can just prescribe and see what the effects are."
"If I think it's COPD, we can do spirometry in our practice. That would give us a pretty good idea. I'd also be trying treatment. See how that goes. Probably, with a younger person with asthma, I might say, ""Try a blue inhaler and see what effect that has."" But that best likely to have a useful effect in an older person. So, maybe I would try a longer-acting, maybe go straight to a LABA/LAMA, depends how bad they are. Or maybe just go to, say, Serevent. Something like that. See what effect it has."
"Hmm. Most of them, I would say. Probably three quarters."
"Concerning probably would be cardiac comorbidities, but it'll often be other risk factors. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, that sort of thing. Arthritis common..."
"Definitely comorbidities and risk factors, yes. If I want advice, I may well refer, or if I'm obviously worried that I need inpatient to be an inpatient. But even if I've referred for advice or further assessment, they normally get passed back."
"I'm not quite sure I follow the question, but it is in my mind always. But I won't necessarily pursue the path if I haven't seen some kind of sign or it's not in the history. So, if there's no history of chest pain, if they're reasonably young and fit, I would be assuming COPD. Or maybe even, depends on their age, but if they're 40, it could be asthma I guess."
"Well, for chronic stuff, not very often at all, really. If they had unstable angina that was hard to control, if their heart failure was such that, despite the medications I could use, then yeah, then I might refer for that. If I thought they needed, say angioplasty, but that would be... That's not normally something I would decide unless their angina was unstable or they had an acute MI, to be honest. So, that would be a chronic issue."
"No, I don't think so. The best treatment is still giving up smoking and doing more exercise and losing weight and all that sort of thing so..."
"Risk factors? Again, I'd say probably three quarters. I mean, more than half. Yeah, majority."
"If they've got established disease and nothing acute, it doesn't really make any difference, I don't think. I can't think it would affect the inhalers I'd prescribe or all the other medications."
I don't think chronically. Not if it was stable. If it was unstable-
"Not an awful lot. A beta blocker is about the only one I can really think of. Beta blockers, obviously very helpful for post MI, or a low dose for cardiac failure."
"And I would simply need to be careful that it didn't make their lung problems worse. But certainly in heart failure, it often is compatible and it may even be with an MI. One would just have to balance it. I probably would give them a beta blocker. Say, ""Look, this is going to reduce possible mortality, but just let me know how your lungs are with it."" Something like that, really."
"I don't think so. I treat it pretty aggressively anyway. I think the treatment is fairly cheap, fairly simple. The better it's treated, the more they can help themselves anyway, in terms of exercise and getting on with life. I don't think it makes any difference."
"Yeah. It would be higher, I think. I   00:18:16  think heart failure. I think it's likely they would not be looking after themselves as well, to be honest, if they've got both. So, maybe they're still smoking. Maybe they're not taking enough exercise. If they've got cardiac failure, it's highly likely they're significantly older, and they're struggling to look after themselves, as well. They'll have more exacerbations anyway."
"It's conceivable that I might refer to a general physician if I just couldn't handle all the different medications I was prescribing them. But I can't think when I last did that, to be honest."
"Well, they don't really refer to GPs. But they might, I suppose, discharge. And when I'm thinking about it, I suppose I see what you mean. So, a cardiologist may say, ""I'm concerned about this chap's COPD. Could you address this?"""
"Often, secondary care physicians, they still don't really understand GPs. So, they might say, ""Can you refer to a respiratory physician,"" actually not realizing that we can deal with them."
"So, we get that quite a lot, to be honest."
"No. They wouldn't even know, to be honest. They don't understand that. I might get, from other GPs, they would say, ""Oh, what do you think about this? You know about the respiratory stuff."" Yeah."
"Well, many of the same risk factors, many of the same treatments, as in lifestyle treatments, otherwise related... Certainly, COPD will worsen the risk for cardiovascular disease. Reduced oxygen, for example, chronic inflammatory state would increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. I'm not sure vice versa, to be honest."
"I think the chronic inflammatory state is a cardiac risk factor. And the low oxygen is the cardiac risk factor. But the other way around, I guess heart failure might affect lung function, but an MI, once you've moved on from the acute, I don't think it would particularly. I guess it affects exercise capacity."
"So, what other stuff? Maybe AF, but I can't think that would really make much difference. Again, it reduces someone's exercise capacity, AF. I don't think it would really be  inaudible 00:22:23  What else? Cardiomyopathy? It's not really relevant to the age group we're talking about. I don't think so."
Can't quite see all the title. It says media access over it. If you can move that.
"Was there something that I can move? Display media it says. Oh, I clicked and it's gone. So, looking at the title again..."
You going through the computer. Might be going through the computer.
"Well, first, I'm not surprised that cardiac and cancer deaths are high in people with COPD. But the data seems very different across the different studies. You are stopping at just... Three are similarish, but then the other two says it's a lot more respiratory related. I don't know, really. I don't know why they're so different."
"Surprise to me? Yeah. I mean, that would be a reasonable figure."
"Like I said before, I think it's mainly the common risk factors. I think people with COPD often drag on a bit longer with their worsening lungs, whereas if they've got the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, maybe something that simply takes them. They're probably not dying of cardiac failure. They're dying of MIs."
"Well, if the first one were the accurate one,  inaudible 00:26:01  just three, I'd say that's more extreme than I thought."
"And the two on the right... Yeah, I can well imagine that cardiac and cancer are problems in COPD, as well. That would be more fit with the reality, as I understood it, than the two on the left."
"Yeah. That's just my impression? But if we take a figure of 39%, then that doesn't surprise me, really. I don't know how that would affect how I manage people. Probably not really."
"  Inaudible 00:27:15  with COPD, double the risk of CVD.... Yeah. I can well imagine that. Makes sense to me. Increased mortality. Yeah. And again, that makes good sense to me. To heart failure and COPD, only 37% increased risk. That's still quite bad, isn't it? So, ischemic heart disease, plus COPD... Can argue that's even a doubling. Could be a 100% increase, couldn't it? None of that surprises me in the slightest."
"So, what it's suggesting is COPD worsens cardiac issues, more than cardiac issues worse than COPD. That's what that, I think, it saying, which is actually what I thought."
"Both together are bad, but yeah, in one direction it's worse than the other direction."
"I am aware of the importance of treating both aggressively, if they've got them both. But I just think I would anyway. So, yeah. It's worth pointing out, definitely. But yeah, I don't think it would change what I would do."
That's interesting. Worth emphasizing. It doesn't surprise me.
"So, that's follow exacerbation... That's interesting, again. So, that's the inflammatory response, the strain on the heart, hypoxia. Those are all not huge surprise."
"Hang on. What this? So. Let's give MI... It's a 0.55... The risk of CV complications is increased by 55%. Does that mean? Incident rate ratio... Or does that, I mean, it's half... Odd, isn't it? Risk of CV complications..."
"I don't get that. So, one to five days after COPD exacerbation, there's a 0.55 chance of a stroke, which is half what it usually would be."
"It's a bit of an odd graphic, that. Because yeah, if at six to 10 days, the stroke risk is 1.4, and therefore... What it says next,  inaudible 00:31:18  40% increase in the risk of stroke. It's not within 10 days, it it? It's six to 10 days. Because the first bit says one to five days. You might as well put an arrow there saying the risk of stroke decreases by 45%, one to five days after COPD exacerbation, which is a very strange statistic. Certainly not worth publicizing if you're trying to get people to treat it effectively."
"It makes sense to me, although I find the figures odd. Particularly the 0.55. I think you're going to have to look into that because if a doctor looks at that, they're going to go, ""What on earth is that all about it?"""
"It just detracts from the whole message, actually. But yeah.   Crosstalk 00:32:20  Doubling. Yeah. Yeah. It's low. It's reduced, isn't it? It's half. It's half what it would otherwise be. And it just doesn't make any sense. It also, actually disagrees with the title."
"Hmm. Well, okay, if it's a 55% increase, then it's an increase. But you see the one on the right, 1.4, it says 40% increase, implying that one would be the level, the normality. And that 1.4 is   00:32:53 "
"What difference would it make. The strain of the infection, again? Hypoxia, the inflammation, the strain on the heart. That would all fit with me. I imagine a severe exacerbation would be worse. The question is what should one do, if anything? I, thus far, haven't done anything else, apart from just treat the moderate exacerbation of COPD."
"Well, it is making me think. Yeah. But I'm not sure what else I would do."
"There's any way, there's any way I can reduce that risk, in the 10 days after of an MI, kind of give them anything, in addition to, say, the prednisone and the antibiotics that they've taken. Is there anything that should be part of the treatment regime for an exacerbation of COPD? Maybe even part of their rescue pack that they have at home."
"There's a triple inhaler... Weeks after just after the start of the trial. Not after an event, is it?"
"So, a triple inhaler, compared to two double inhalers, both of them have a benefit. Though you're adding steroids to LABA/LAMA or LAMA, two steroids, and LABA. If it was compared to three different inhalers, that'll be kind of interesting. I think it probably would still share a result because people don't take three inhalers properly, compared to a triple inhaler. And the delivery system might be better, as well. So, but yeah, you're just adding the treatment, aren't you?. So, that's why doesn't surprise me any."
"You know, steroids benefit the reversal element of COPD, and a LAMA just works by a different mechanism. Combine them all together and you're just going to get additive benefit. Which looking at product X here, the  inaudible 00:36:26  reduction... Number needed to treat of 80..."
"Well, 80 is actually very high. I find that unimpressive."
"Also, is it saying over a year? I guess you're just saying over a year. So, now you'd need to treat for one year, would save one life of 80 people treated. That's not that bad, actually."
"If it's mortality over a year, therefore over five years, it'd be saving presumably five lives of 80 treated, which is actually quite good. Actually, no that's all right. It just needs clarifying. It's not clear."
"I am trying to move people onto triple therapy already. I suppose the question is how bad were they at beginning of the trial? Is this everybody, or is this people with moderate COPD or..."
"Well, I'd be looking to put them on triple therapy anyway. But this is reasonably persuasive and that's the right course of action. Definitely."
"Yeah. Yeah. Definitely seeing things like this just impressed importance of that. Because you know, as you say, if an NNT is 80, and I have 80 such patients, and I haven't put them on them, in one year, one of them will be dead. That's pretty important."
"Yeah. Oh,  inaudible 00:38:41  so CV death is also cardiac and stroke... Surprised that X is the same as steroid and LABA, actually, for death. And in terms of...  Inaudible 00:39:05  patients seems higher from a confirmed major adverse kind of event. I don't quite get that. Presentation of the other data then, one has to work through this to work it out when it's all numbers and things."
"Well, one needs to look at the title. I guess that's what they're trying to communicate."
"X and the LABA/LAMA... And it's a percentage of patients... It does look to me... Say, look at nonfatal stroke, that they're nearly twice as likely to have a nonfatal stroke with product X as either of the other two treatments. Am I right? Is that..."
The LABA/LAMA has much higher deaths than the other two. It must be that the steroids are protective. Don't really know why. That's the biggest difference. Do you have any explanation really?
It's a similar question. The CV death is similar graph to major adverse cardiac events. Pretty similar to nonfatal. I just don't quite get the nonfatal stroke. You seem to be more like to have a nonfatal stroke than either of the other treatment  inaudible 00:41:49 . Maybe not very high numbers. Yeah. That's the trouble with interpreting data. That's maybe not very high numbers. It's perhaps data that's a bit more useful.
"Well, there might be. Well, that might be the explanation for the third graph along. I just   00:42:21  that would mean. Yeah."
"The trouble is, in this data, it seems that an  ICS 00:42:49  and LABA is better than product X."
"In other words, they're triple therapy. It confuses me, because I would say that's very good for COPD, but it actually seems to make the situation worse for cardiovascular disease. If not worse, then certainly no better."
"If you look at the graph on the left, then triple therapy is worse than ICS/ LABA. It's a for confirmed  mace 00:43:31 . And if you go all the way to the right for CV death, and the triple therapy product X is the same as ICS/LABA, and LABA/LAMA is much worse. It doesn't seem any point, at least from a cardiovascular point of view, in using triple therapy."
"But then that wouldn't be why I'd use it though, to be honest. It's unfortunate, but I'd be using it, obviously, first."
Yeah. I'm familiar. Quite actually in the reduction in CV deaths.
"This is LAMA/LABA. Yeah. Yeah. This is LABA/LAMA, and yeah. I mean, that's true. And we just saw that on the other graphs, but then my question is, okay, well it compared to ICS/LABA, that doesn't... That seems to be different to what the other graph showed."
"Well, whenever I see something like that product, actually the reduction of CV deaths versus LABA/LAMA, then I start thinking, well, what's, what's the other data? I definitely would want to know how it compares to a LABA under an ICS."
"On this graph, it still looks good. Yeah."
"Yes. I think you're right. Yeah. I'm not quite sure why that is. I think people don't think the steroid  inaudible 00:46:00  is very effective, but I think it is. I find that a bit odd really. And here's an extra evidence why it would be a good idea. Yeah."
"That's true. Yeah. It makes the point of how important that is. I think if people aren't escalating, on the basis of COPD, then yeah, I think this is an extra incentive. Without a doubt."
"To move to triple therapy sooner, rather than later."
"Landmark CV studies. Yeah. Interesting.  inaudible 00:47:06  study. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Looking at the right hand side... Product X, single inhaler, triple therapy studies."
"Right. So, and this is single inhaler, triple therapy studies. Okay."
"Yeah. Well, Y looks better than X. Surprises me a bit. Yeah. So again, more persuasive evidence that triple and inhaler is better than LABA/LAMA. But I say that, and yet you've got data insisting one triple inhaler is worse. Which I just don't understand."
"It depends on the... Well, the steroid  inaudible 00:48:37 , the long-acting beta agonist. I think there's only one LAMA, really. It can't be that. Or the trial doesn't have enough people in it. I don't know."
"Because the LABA varies in how long... It truly is long-acting beta agonist. Some of them are for fairly median. Some of them are very long-acting. Which is why some LABAs can actually be used as, almost as short-acting, beta agonist in acute therapy. It may be that's the difference. Something like formoterol is shorter acting compared to some of the others. Yeah. I don't know. I hadn't considered it would have a cardiovascular effect, but maybe it does."
"Absolute risk. Oh, oh, right. All right. Okay, okay. All right. I've misunderstood it then. So, it's not that one is level and the X makes it worse. It's actually that..."
"Estimate it. It's reducing it more. Well, that's... Sorry. That's reassuring. It's just that... So, X is better than Y. Not X is completely different to Y, right? Okay. Got it. Yeah. Right. Good. So, what was the question?"
"Yeah. That helps. Actually, I haven't looked that properly. Yeah. So, that's therefore it's similar data to support number need to treat 80... Yeah."
"No, I wouldn't expect that, actually. No, it's a very good point. Yeah. So, using statin versus placebo, you got to treat 164 people. Whereas using this product compared to LABA/LAMA, only 80, so actually that's pretty good. Yeah."
"Well, Y still isn't bad. It would partly depend on cost, local formulary guidelines. But if product X was just as good in COPD, which is another, another factor, and that may depend on how short or long acting the LABA is, then all other things being equal, then one ought to be using product X. Absolutely."
"Yeah. Sort of. Well, the thing is, if products are very similar, then actually one can piggyback on the data of the other. Even if it's not supposed to. One can be licensed because it's done the trial. It's like, yeah well, they're pretty similar products. If one is lot cheaper than the other one, then you wouldn't necessarily go for the other one just because it's got real word data, I'm afraid. So, I tend to think certainly in terms of cost."
"Yes, I think it's... Although I what I think, it's clearly even more stronger than I thought."
"Just the mortality data. That the first 10 days afterwards, it just shows you... Maybe with an excess of trying to think, what would I do with an exacerbation, getting straight on a triple inhaler? That might be something to do like that."
"If it's helping... Yeah. Well, if it's helping COPD as well, then it would be no-brainer, so to speak. And if it wasn't too expensive. Yeah."
"Oh yeah, absolutely. But I mean only with... It goes with everything. If it reduces mortality, it makes people feel better, then great. If it reduces mortality and people feel crap, then no. And you do get that with some drugs, don't you? With some hypertensive drugs. And then you got to get a balance. I cannot see a product like this making people feel worse and improving the mortality. So, it's going to be a useful treatment. Definitely."
"No, it's been very interesting, actually. Thank you. I see it as an educational session, as well as an interesting hour."
"So I work in a teaching hospital in the north of England. I do a specialist COPD clinic, and I see a mixture in that clinic of general COPD referrals. I see a lot of difficult to manage COPD cases that come from primary care, but also colleagues in secondary care, both within the center I work out and also across the region and we also run a lung volume reduction service. So I get sent patients with hyperinflation for consideration of either surgery or endo-bronchial interventions."
"Acute respiratory care as well so we have a separate respiratory take in the hospital where I work, when I'm on call I just see respiratory patients and certainly pre COVID COPD made up a big chunk of those respiratory admissions, probably 60% of the admissions were related to COPD. That's changed quite a bit in the last year or two with COVID and we have seen less coming through. But I see the range, I guess I see the more severe end of the disease."
"No. No, so I do more outpatient than inpatient. I do a general respiratory clinic where I get some COPD patients, but I run a specialist COPD clinic as well, although there's quite...  00:04:50 "
In that clinic. And in that clinic I see a mixture of primary care referrals and as well as secondary care and tertiary referrals.
"Yeah. I think triple therapy is an established option for now in patients who are uncontrolled on dual bronchodilators, usually people with an exacerbation history and the eosinophil peripheral, eosinophil count is a good guide for us with that. And we look at the count if it's less than 0.1 and be very reluctant to give them steroids. If it's over 0.3, I'm very keen to give them inhaled steroids if it's in between   00:05:44  depending on the history."
"Rule of steroids is more defined now than it was before, thankfully."
"No, I would say later; on it depends on their eosinophil account to some extent. And certainly if patients have an eosinophilic phenotype then I would use it earlier, but generally it's later on. It's probably third line treatment that I would use; there are always exceptions to that."
"Well, I think it depends on the patients and COPD isn't asthma, and we try and get them on the best treatment from the start. So I don't think there is quite the delay in stepping through the treatments. I think they escalate up through the treatments very quickly and the guidelines recommend escalating treatment if they're still symptomatic which many of them are because I think the inhalers that we have are only a small part of the management of COPD and often don't make a massive difference to patient symptoms so we do tend to escalate quite quickly. I think we've always done that though certainly within secondary care with the more severe end of the COPD patients, in the 16 years I've been a consultant I've never been keen on putting somebody on a single bronchodilator for a year, and then up into  inaudible 00:07:40  bronchodilators. It is about trying to get them under control as quickly as we can."
"I see quite a severe end of the spectrum. I would guess that 35, 40% of the patients I see might be on triple therapy and we try to use, or I try to use a single inhaler if I can. And certainly all new prescriptions I would start patients on one of the combination inhalers. There are some people established on inhalers which they like and their condition is stable and they don't want to change. So there's a small proportion continue on separate devices but I'd say it's probably a quarter...  00:08:32 "
"Probably over the last five years it's gone down because I think the role of inhaled steroids has become a little bit more clear, and certainly five years ago I think everybody was ending up on triple therapy. And I think now, depending on the eosinophil count, we are generally as a community happier to keep people on dual therapy depending on the phenotype."
"So I think quite a lot's been made of the combination inhalers in terms of improving compliance and so on. There's been a number of trials and that's always difficult comparing the big trials because they have slightly different or very different designs and different populations and different running periods. I think it can all get confusing. As I say, I think the role of inhaled steroids has been better defined over recent years. And I think we've gone from treating everybody with COPD the same. And as far as the step through, the old guidelines used to funnel everybody into triple therapy if they were still symptomatic. And all of them were because, as I said before, I think inhalers are only a small part of the management of COPD. So they all wind up on triple therapy, whereas now I think we're better at treating individual patients, better at treating phenotypes. And I think the use of the peripheral blood eosinophil counts really helped in stopping the overuse of inhaled steroids."
"I think it's a good starting point showing what a big problem COPD is. I guess it's a little confusing, it says 394,000,000 people globally have COPD. Does that mean diagnosed COPD or is that...  00:13:08 "
"And then there's another 50% that are undiagnosed is what it...It's a huge problem. I mean, gosh, there's a lot of information here isn't there? Up to four..."
"Yeah. I mean, gosh, it used to be fourth and it always used to be said that it's the only one that's increasing in the top 10. Everything else is coming down with treatment; COPD's increasing."
"Well, I think it's just setting the scene and showing what a big problem it is globally, but also locally I think it would help on this slide if it's aimed at the UK market to have the data for the UK as well."
"I think maybe a comment about the mortality rate, following exacerbations as well. I think that's a useful piece of knowledge to include."
"Yeah. So they've got the 40% of  inaudible 00:15:11  within 90 days, but it's quite a high mortality as well over the next one to two years. If they're wanting to bring in data about exacerbations there then I think that's an important..."
"So initial thought it's quite a complicated slide, I think."
"So, gosh, it's almost it's two slides really I think. Because you're trying to take in the big world map and the different shades of red and then there's the map of England with the different shades of blue with the writing with that. And I think it's a little confusing having them side by side."
"So if I was presenting this and trying to make a point, I would be highlighting the difference in outcomes within a country based on socioeconomic status. Even though it's the same disease that the wildly different prognosis depending on which parts of the country you live in and which socioeconomic group that you're in."
Just that exacerbations are common and the majority of patients will experience them over a three-year period.
"Well, so it's different, isn't it? In the clinic I work in it's probably higher than that."
"We're in secondary care and a lot of our referrals are due to exacerbations and recurrence exacerbations. Some of them come because of pure breathlessness, but mainly it's related to exacerbations. I didn't realize it was that high in the eclipse study. I'm surprised at that."
"So I guess I would want to know what they're calling an exacerbation, how it's defined."
"Yeah. I mean, gosh, it's just an overview, isn't it? If you are presenting this there's a lot to talk about there. But I think they they're all good points."
So the exacerbations are very common in COPD patients and then they have a very significant impact on patients.
I guess just because I have questions about the data and I would...
"So it'd probably be higher if the person was sat here, explaining it through me, answering my questions, I would probably rate it higher."
I think it makes an important point. So it's showing the impact of exacerbations on lung function.
"Yeah, I think it's interesting, isn't it? I guess the question is how long the follow up is. So guess you're losing more lung function in the mild patients after an exacerbation and this is a severe exacerbation, so I guess it raises lots of questions, doesn't it? How common are severe exacerbations in people with mild COPD? How long did they follow them up for? How long was that declining lung function recorded; was it just over the subsequent year or was it the next five years or 10 years? Did that make a difference depending on exacerbation rates and therefore can you make a difference with treatment? It raises lots of questions."
The exacerbations appear to have a significant impermanent effect on lung function.
"Well, and on the left. I mean, again they're presenting lung function measurements eight weeks before and eight weeks after. I guess I'd want to know what they're like 12 weeks after and 16 weeks after."
"So exacerbations carry an increased risk with them. But then again, it raises questions in my mind: there's an odd ratio that 20%, 80%, but what's the absolute risk? What are you comparing with the five year survival of 80% in that top black line with no acute exacerbations and the five year survivals? Eighty percent, which seems quite low to me, it depends on the severity of their underlying COPD. There are other problems, there's lots of potential confounding factors here. So again, I guess it gets the message over, but it raises lots of questions about the data as well."
"Not at all. No. But again, it depends how they are defining exacerbations and they just say exacerbations, don't they, rather than moderate or severe. But no, that's not my experience. And I think...  00:28:51  Sorry?"
"Yeah. Sorry. No, I understand that. But in that top box, they say acute exacerbations; they don't say moderate or severe. And then below it they say following three or more and they just say exacerbations."
"Well, yeah. I'd like to see...  00:29:20  That mortality rate seems higher than I would expect. Three exacerbations, they don't specify a time period. Do they mean in the last 12 months or longer? And if someone's had three exacerbations, 50% of them will be dead within three years. But it doesn't...  00:29:39 "
"So, it would be the questions I'm raising now. I'd want to understand the data more."
"Gosh, so I think it is relevant. So you mean on a scale of one to seven?"
"Seven. I mean, it's very relevant if we're talking about risk and hospitalization and death."
"Credible, I'd mark this quite low. I would say a three."
Yeah. Because of all the questions that I have about the data and the way it's presented.
"Well, because I have reservations about the numbers on the screen."
"Yeah. Very important message, showing that an exacerbation has systemic effects. It's not just about what happens in the lungs. We know there's a big association between lung disease and heart disease, but I think this just highlights that it's not just about the lungs, it's this double the risk of having an MI. And 40% greater chance of having a stroke...   00:32:10 "
"I think it's important to highlight that. So the first time I saw this, I hadn't really thought about it. As a chest physician it's something I think I should know about and it's good to see it highlighted and presented like that."
"Yeah, it was a meeting, a webinar about exacerbations and COPD about a year ago now."
I'm trying to remember who organized it. I think it was AstraZeneca.
"Yeah. Well differently, it further underlines the importance and the impact that exacerbations have."
"Yeah. So as I say, I've seen data like this; I'm sure I've seen a very similar slide to this actually or maybe it was in two slides. But I've certainly seen this data presented. So it was new to me when I first saw it but as I said that was about 12 months ago."
So the left hand side of the slide I think is interesting and relevant.
"Well, certainly the top statement, because I mean in some ways it's common sense but it's important to spell it out. And it's something that as a chest physician seeing somebody with COPD I should be wondering about cardiovascular disease and asking about it and either treating it or referring to the appropriate person.   00:36:17  The information on the right, I think is a bit pointless."
"Well, the numbers don't mean very much to me; just a relative risk. In fact, it doesn't tell me what the absolute risk. And to take the left box it's saying that somebody with COPD and ischemic heart disease has got a higher mortality rate than somebody who's just got one of them. I mean, it seems a bit obvious to me."
"Absolutely. Yeah. And again, it's about treating the comorbidities and recognizing that cardiovascular comorbidities are common and looking for those and making sure they're properly treated."
"Motivation to prevent exacerbations? Gosh, I don't know, three?"
Because I don't think this information really has any impact on my desire to prevent exacerbations.
"Well, yes and we did that on the other slide, didn't we? But I don't think the slide you've just showed me is making that link because there's no....   00:38:22 "
"So it's just saying the same thing as the slide before that cardiovascular disease, common cause of death. Gosh. So it's interesting the way it's presented, not so sure about up to 39%, I mean that's based on that one study with just 18 deaths in it; it's the smallest number. It's the highest proportion. It's probably...   00:40:03 "
So I feel they're overstating a bit with the up to 39%.
"Yeah. They should take some kind of weighted average and I'm sure the number would be closer to 20, 25, wouldn't it?"
"So, I haven't seen that data presented. No. But I mean, it makes sense in a way that you've got more severe COPD more likely to die from the respiratory complication than if it's less severe."
"No, I'm not sure what point they're making."
"No, I would say that the moderate ones are less at risk of dying of respiratory disease because their lung disease isn't as bad. I mean, from the data that is there I don't think there's enough to say that if you've got GOLD Stage II you're more at risk of dying from a cardiovascular event than III and IV. We don't know the numbers to enter, I don't know why they've lumped III and IV together and then we've just got II. You can do anything with data in the way that you present it."
I think that's all a reasonable hypothesis.
"Well, it is; it doesn't really fit with the last slide where they are trying to show me that the risk of cardiovascular death is higher in people with moderate disease. Because all those things you're talking about: hyperinflation, hypoxia and tachycardia are going to be more common in patients with severe COPD than they are in the moderate COPD. And the effects of the exacerbation are likely to be more severe in the severe COPD."
"Yeah. As I say, I've gone back to that slide haven't I, because I don't like this slide at all."
"It has an impact on the next slide though, as well. So I'm still..."
"Because the whole hypothesis here is saying that the exacerbations increase the cardiovascular risk by causing hyperinflation, hypoxemia or tachycardia, all of which will be more common in patients with more severe disease."
So they're trying to give an explanation for the increased cardiovascular risk following an exacerbation.
"Well, because it's just a hypothesis and it's not based on any data there. So the other side I found more persuasive and more relevant. This is okay. It's a little bit interesting. Is it a reasonable hypothesis? It's an attempt to explain the observed findings, but that's all. So on its own it doesn't do very much for me."
"Yeah. That's reasonable. I guess it takes me back to the slide earlier on showing the data from the Eclipse study showing that saying that 77% of patients will have an exacerbation over three years. They're all at risk, really."
So certainly the first and the last one; I'm not sure about the middle one.
"So that they're trying to show you how to identify those most at risk of future exacerbations, I guess."
"So it's showing that exacerbations are a little bit of a vicious circle and the more you have, the more you're likely to have in the future. And the more frequent that they become."
"So I think that's certainly true in some patients, again you wonder about the data don't you and I presume it's from the Eclipse and just an observational study, but you wonder about the effects of treatment and so on."
"Probably, gosh, I don't know. So amongst chest physicians, I think it is quite common knowledge, it's a message that's been given many times."
"That it's important to treat exacerbations and get on top of them, otherwise that things get worse, things will escalate basically."
So I think they're just showing that. Yeah. Oh gosh. I haven't seen it presented like this. So they're saying...
"Yeah. It's a strange way of presenting. I mean, I get the message, but it's a strange way. I don't think it's a very clear slide."
"Yeah. But I think this is potentially misleading. So what I said was if the eosinophil count's over 0.3, then I would treat them with an inhaled steroid. I think below 0.3, certainly between 0.2 and 0.3 and potentially between 0.1 and 0.3, it's a gray area and it's not clear. And I don't think that's a justification to give inhaled steroids to everybody."
"And that's probably why I'm reacting badly to this slide because I'm sure that's the message they're wanting to give: give it to everybody and you prevent exacerbations and I don't think that's true. And I don't think getting inhaled steroids is without risk and this is almost a throwback to the battle days of COPD management, where we give everybody Seretide regardless of phenotype. And we just labeled everybody COPD and treated them the same. And I think we've made quite big improvements in the way we manage COPD and think about phenotypes and treatable traits and data like this, I think I just react badly to it because I can imagine the message and I think it's wrong."
"Yeah. I mean, I don't know. So I don't like the data, I don't like the way it's presented. I must admit, I don't know the details of the study so again, this would prompt a bit more of a discussion about the study and the design of the study and the patients involved."
"So that it's a combination of treatment approaches, as it says, I think it's good that smoking cessations at the top and pulmonary rehab are mentioned above pharmacological treatments; so think that side's okay."
"So I just said about the pharmacological treatment, it's difficult because they quote several large trials, all of which will have recruited patients at risk of exacerbation. So it's not quite true across the board."
"Yeah. But it's to do with the design of the trial and the running period and everything. And on the other side, I think there is a rule for earlier diagnosis and targeted case finding of patients. But I think there's also a need for evidence to show that does make a difference ultimately to outcomes because I don't think that's there at the moment."
"So I think there are phenotyping to identify treatable traits is really important and identifying those at risk of exacerbations, it depends why they're at risk of exacerbations. So I think that is appropriate but there's a bit more to it than just thinking about inhaled steroids and exacerbations."
"I like the identification of patients. I think the second box down, the headline should be about phenotyping."
But block three should mention quality of life and symptom control rather than just exacerbations and mortality.
"So I think the overall theme is it's focusing purely on exacerbations and pharmacological therapy thereof. Has it made me think about things differently? Not really, I don't think. I think if we're going to think about causes of exacerbations it's quite narrow the way they've approached it and they've focused on when they've come onto treatment. The only bit about treatment really is the ICS and eosinophils, isn't it, rather than thinking about everything else...   01:05:04 "
I'm not sure it would alter my approach to managing patients because I've seen   01:05:58  reducing the exacerbations is a key aim for us.
"Gosh, so I'm convinced that the rules that triple therapy and the management of certain COPD patients, it's difficult to comment on this. So in the study populations it's clearly effective and certainly significantly more effective than the LAMA/LABA group without an increased risk associated with it, without the increased risk in pneumonia apparently. And yeah, there's the improvement in all cause mortality. So it all looks very impressive, but then it comes down to the design of the trial, the study population, the running period. Are these results generalizable to the population that I treat? It raises all sorts of questions that the headline data, yes, is impressive, but...   01:09:57 "
"So, I think, yes, the presentation is good at promoting the importance of exacerbations in mind we should treat earlier. And I'm a little bit reticent about saying we would give everybody this new drug bus, it depends on the study populations and design of the study. I think I have quite a clear view where I would use triple therapy and I don't think that's been changed by anything...   01:11:23 "
So at the moment it would fit alongside the other triple therapies.
"Earlier than it used to be, I don't know, because I don't think COPD is like asthma. I don't think we do step up the treatments like we do in asthma. I always want to try and get people on the right treatment from the start. I think it's clearer now who I would put on inhaled steroids than before, as I say, there was a danger before. We put everybody on ICS, LABA and then the tiotropium data came out and everybody had a had tiotropium. And I think it's clearer now, which population I would treat with triple therapy. I still don't think I would start triple therapy early on in somebody who appears to have relatively mild or moderate disease. I think its role is more in the severe to very severe, depending on...   01:12:47 "
"No, somebody with heart disease it wouldn't increase my chances of treating them with an inhaled steroid. I'd want my heart disease treated properly. I don't think a steroid is good treatment for heart disease."
I think the increased cardiovascular risk is more to do with comorbidities not being recognized and treated properly rather than anything else.
The fact that an exacerbation increases your risk of hospitalization and death. I think that's important to recognize.
So I think the point they're trying to get across is a COPD exacerbation is a multisystem event that has significant effects over and above just the symptoms caused at the time of the exacerbation and have an impact on quality of life and mortality.
"The one about the increased risk following exacerbations,"
"Hello everyone. And thank you. We now have the respondent on the line. Diane, you may go ahead."
I guess muscular-skeletal and I vasectomies as well.
"Yeah. My wife's meant to be coming back and trying to pick up the little one, but she's just crawling around on the floor  inaudible 00:03:06 ."
"Well, they're usually a bit older, 50 and above. I mean, the-"
"I mean, most of them are probably relatively mild, probably about 70%, probably just on a single inhaler. And then maybe... or maybe 60%, and then maybe 30% are kind of... doing inhaler therapy, and then maybe the 10% are the more severe."
"Like I said, about 10%, so maybe five, I guess."
"Well, I said, I said 10%, so yeah, 10%. So I thought you meant five patients, but maybe 10%."
"I mean, it goes on... it's probably the more severe patients basically. The ones that have the most... worst quality of life or have a lot of frequent hospital admissions. We try to put them onto the max therapies, I guess."
"Our practice has these COPD reviews, annual reviews. So either it's alerted to us via the nurse who does the COPD reviews, or the patient themselves are just saying... calling up saying, ""I'm struggling more,"" or they've had an exacerbation of COPD, and seeing that, we need to  inaudible 00:05:44  steroids. But then afterwards, after following them up, like a week or so afterwards, we say, ""We've had two or three exacerbations in the last year, we probably need to step you up."""
"So take a history, so you know how long they've had it and then the situations they may be getting short breath. So if it's at rest or if they're on exertion. I guess if there's any associated symptoms with that, so if there's any chest pain, are they coughing with it, have they got any other symptoms, like leg swelling or leg pain. And then check if they've got any medical conditions already. So anything do with the heart or lungs or if they could be anemic. Look for signs of anemia and then check their social history, make sure they're not... see if they're smoking or recreational drugs or anything else that could be... Check their work, like social history as well, so that would include their work. So are they working on the tube or are they exposed a lot of dust or something like that. And then you probably want to bring them down to examine them, if they're... make sure that they're okay, check their fats, check their heart and lungs, check their pulse. And then we'd look for signs of anemia and then, I guess, depending on what that shows, you can decide what to do next. That may include some investigation, so that could be a chest x-ray, some blood tests, ECG. I guess it totally depends on what the history and examination show. And then, I guess from there, you'd work out  inaudible 00:08:02 ."
"If it's a cardiovascular cause, did you say?"
So is this from after the examination or is this after the investigation?
"I mean, generally, shortness of breath in cardiac disease, either it could be a quite a serious thing, which may need referral to a cardiologist or advice from the cardiologist, at least. Yeah, and generally it is due to the cardiological system, then it generally is a referral. We could probably try some treatment in the meantime, if it's something  inaudible 00:09:28 , let's say heart failure, try to get rid of... if they're fluid overloaded and that's why their breathless, then we can give them some water tablet diuretics to try to offload some fluid in the meantime, but most of the time it's probably, if it's a new onset shortness of breath related to the cardiology, then it probably is  inaudible 00:09:47  or referral to a cardiology service."
"To me, you sound the same, but I don't know about anyone else."
"Yeah, I can hear you. I can hear you. There's just a lot of rustling and-"
"So I guess it depends on the cause. I mean, I guess the main causes of shortness of breath are lung causes, so-"
"Okay, yeah. Okay, so if it's COPD, then shortness of breath, then you'd probably just follow... try a simple inhaler. Well, usually it's a LABA or a LAMA. So probably could just go either. So you could try  inaudible 00:13:52  and then just... if it's the first diagnosing of a mild COPD, then yeah, that would probably be something like that."
"Oh, probably a good... I would hazard a guess about 80%, if not more   00:14:20 -"
"I guess, on its own it is always quite a worrying condition. Yeah, I think more just mainly on its own."
"Cardiovascular risk? I guess, honestly, probably not. Unless it's also part of your symptoms, but I'd probably, if it's the conversation's just about COPD or shortness of breath, I'd probably concern myself more about the COPD. Probably."
"So I guess in the UK, I  inaudible 00:16:09  in America, we have a system where we can ask for advice from the hospital.  inaudible 00:16:17 . We can either write them a letter and then, within relatively short term, they can write a letter back, just giving us some advice on what to do, which could be some treatments or they would say, ""Oh, you need to get more investigations,"" or they could say, ""We'll take the referral,"" so then they'll just turn that letter into a referral and then they will see the patient. And then if they've seen the patient and they've said, ""Oh, this patient should start this,"" then we can just continue that in  inaudible 00:16:46 ."
"Probably not really. To me. It depends on what they've come in for. I guess if they've come to see me for, I guess, chest pain, then I guess the cardiovascular disease takes precedent. But then if they're more coughing, than probably more worry about their COPD. But I think equally they're both quite bad conditions, to be honest."
"To me, yeah. Yeah, that's how I would see it."
"I mean, if it's something like stable angina, that you normally would treat initially with maybe a GTN spray and look at their medications to see if you can control it. So beta blockers or ACE inhibitors or anything else that can do to control their angina. I guess that's the main things, yeah."
"So if they had got COPD, but they haven't got established cardiovascular disease?"
"I mean, it depends. Because if they've done a scan through, like they've done a CT scan of the chest or like an MRI of the heart and they've just found and incidental lung nodule thing, then they may alert you to that.  inaudible 00:20:27  that. And then they'd say, ""Oh, this needs a respiratory follow-up."" But they wouldn't go out of their way to find another disease."
"I mean, the main risk factor for COPD would be smoking and then smoking itself is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. And generally, I don't know if this is kind of a generalization or stereotype, that people who are generally smoking generally probably don't have the greatest of lifestyle habits either, diet or exercise. So they may themself also be at risk of cardiovascular disease. So they kind of do go hand in hand sometimes."
"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I guess that's my, probably limited understanding, yeah. I don't feel they do."
"Cause of death  inaudible 00:22:26 . So cancer relatively high. I mean, all the studies show different things. That's one thing. I don't know. I don't know any of these studies, so I don't know what the cohorts were or where it was done, but it doesn't look like they're very... there's no definitive thing that they're showing what they're for."
"No, because it doesn't necessarily say that COPD made their cardiac disease worse or that because, as I said, they probably coexist in a lot of COPD patients, but I don't know if this study shows that the cardiovascular disease was made worse because of their COPD. It could have been that their cardio disease was in general worse or better managed than their COPD. So but I mean, it is important to know that these patients have multiple conditions."
" inaudible 00:24:42 . Okay, so having COPD with cardiovascular disease seems to have worse outcome."
"I mean, having two conditions, which are both severe, COPD and heart disease are quite serious conditions. But I don't know whether... I mean, I'm assuming there probably is a... there will be a link between the two, but I mean, having... I'm trying to articulate what I want to say, but I think two conditions will be worse than having one condition by itself, if that makes sense."
"I guess it doesn't say the cause of... if this risk of mortality, if  inaudible 00:26:09 . So this mortality, if that's the mortality of cardiovascular disease or mortality of COPD and cardiovascular disease? Does that make sense?"
"So I'm just wondering, with these  inaudible 00:26:40  deaths, is this the mortality... have they died from COPD or have they died from heart disease or what's the percentage of? Just generalized deaths?"
"I didn't realize that. Damage from COPD  inaudible 00:27:50  goes beyond the lungs, this  inaudible 00:27:53  increased followed moderate exacerbation. So I guess that, I mean, that probably is useful to know that someone's risk of these kind of serious conditions are increased following these COPD exacerbations. We see COPD exacerbations all the time, but I guess it's not something that pops into my head that they could be at risk of having an MI or stroke a few days afterwards. So that is interesting to know."
"To be honest, probably not. I guess we would treat them with... if there's exacerbation, we treat them antibiotics or steroids, but I guess we would... I guess I could look at their risk factors for these cardiovascular diseases. So like I said, if they're on statins, et cetera. But it's just, I guess realistically, whether we would do that every time we see a COPD patient? But yeah, I guess I will have to think about it a little bit more, about if there's risks that could occur afterwards."
"I guess only if they fit. I wouldn't push it above what the guidance is. I wouldn't go out of my way to put so much into therapy if they didn't quite fit guidance, just because we had one exacerbation of COPD."
"It's probably related to the... well, my biochemistry days are long gone, but I would assume it's either a kind of inflammatory response, like the whole body's in kind of... if there's an infection, then the inflammation makes the  inaudible 00:30:26  worse, or makes the blood vessels a bit thickened around the coronary artery. Or that they have low oxygen, so the heart pumps are more strained and it's having to work harder just to push the blood around the body.  inaudible 00:30:43 , again, might be working harder because of the infection. But I honestly, probably, I've got it totally gone. I'm not sure 100%   00:30:59 -"
"I mean, that's interesting. I mean, yeah, you would've thought they would only be in the most severe ones where they're going into hospital and  inaudible 00:31:21 . But yeah, that is interesting to know."
" inaudible 00:31:34 . Okay, so 89% reduction in deaths.  inaudible 00:31:53 . Okay."
"I mean, going on the triple therapy seems to be much better than being on any of the dual therapies  inaudible 00:32:32 . Though the  inaudible 00:32:34  level was supposedly nonsignificant, but I guess makes it look quite good. But I guess it is nonsignificant. But yeah, it makes it look like the triple therapy seems to reduce mortality in a lot of these COPD patients."
"I mean, I assume there's the guidelines for reasons, that in the UK we have this... well, there's loads of different bodies, but the main one we use is NICE guidelines, and they have these kind of GOLD guidelines as well. And I assume they followed it, they've done these studies themselves. And I'm sure they get updated like semi-regularly to get the newest... what the best evidence is in terms of preventing that and morbidity and stuff."
"So seems to prevent all types of deaths, but not COPD deaths, interestingly. COPD hasn't really changed, but the cardiac causes and... seems have gone down probably the most. Interesting. But yeah, that is interesting."
"Well, it could be that these... I mean, they're all quite equally effective in terms of COPD, but it may be that most people from COPD probably may die from cardiac disease or cardiac... well, a heart disease of some sort."
"I mean, compared to the LABA/LAMA, it looks like... I don't have the statistics, but it looks like it's significant, there's a significant drop in death there compared to that. It doesn't seem to be that different to the ICS/LABA in that sense. I wonder whether it's even that significant over the ICS/LABA in total? Because it's not that dissimilar."
" inaudible 00:36:27 . I think I mentioned the inflammatory response, and it may be that the ISC... the steroid in both the ICS and in the triple therapy, may be helping to reduce the inflammation in the blood vessels, which reduces angiosclerosis. But that could be a long shot. It probably is something to do with angiosclerosis, but I don't know the exact  inaudible 00:36:52  behind it. And I guess that's the only thing I can think of that could explain it. Yeah."
"Yes. I mean, I didn't realize that the risk of heart attack and stroke was so high after these exacerbations of COPD. And I mean,  inaudible 00:37:49  holds some kind of credence that there is a link. I guess I do also feel that a lot of these patients have... they probably developed these conditions because of their risk factors that they've developed or they've acquired. And yeah, it sounds like there definitely is a link. I also think there is, not coincidence, but they developed these conditions possibly because actually they share the same risk factors."
"CV events. So what's MAC, sorry, again? Oh, sorry, major adverse   00:38:59 -"
"Okay.  inaudible 00:39:02 . So what does that include? Because you've put MI and stroke there, does that include exactly that?"
So is that the total of the MI stroke and cardiovascular death?
"Yeah, together. Okay. So product X. So I mean, according to that...  inaudible 00:39:34 ... according to that, that means it shows that the ICS/LABA has a lower percentage of CV events than the product X. I mean, I don't know if it's significant, it probably isn't, but going through this graph, then using an ICS/LABA is probably more beneficial than product X."
"I mean, I probably wouldn't have known that before this. I wouldn't have known that there was that big a difference between... well, there was a difference between the different inhalers. So I guess it is all interesting to me."
"Okay.  inaudible 00:40:51  LABA/LAMA. Okay. But it's not in the graph, it's just an extra bit that they just stated?"
"I mean, the numbers look impressive. I mean, comparing it to the LABA/LAMA, but I mean, it is interesting that they've grayed out the nonsignificant difference between the ICS/LABA and haven't really mentioned it. Sorry, that's only because I knew about the other slide. So yeah, I mean, obviously it looks impressive."
"No. Because it already proves that the product X is better than the LABA/LAMA. So I mean, whilst it does show that there's good percentage reduction, I don't think it really gives that much extra, because it already shows it a lot better."
"Maybe. Maybe because I'm just a bit  inaudible 00:42:43  but if people dying is just as bad... if they're going to die of something, it's probably best to  inaudible 00:42:48  all types of death as opposed to just one particular form of death. So just probably more interested in preventing the overall deaths."
"The number needed to treat. I remember  inaudible 00:43:19  my statistics, only recently because I had to do some, but I think a lot of... I think some doctors may not remember the idea of the number needed to treat. Which, I don't know who you're marketing this to, but it could... to be honest, 80 seems quite highish to be honest. Number needed to treat to prevent one death. Super high. I mean, it doesn't seem that it would be that effective, if 80... you probably want to put that lower."
"On maybe because I was going on my... I think maybe obviously the specialists would probably know more about numbers because they do a lot of research, et cetera. But I think as GPs, maybe I'm only speaking for myself, but we don't really read that much studies or research. So the number needed to treat may be a concept that people may have forgotten."
" inaudible 00:44:53  LABA/LAMA. Okay. Product Y? There's another product, there's a product Y now?"
"Okay, but it's different? Is product X and product Y different?"
"Oh, okay. Okay. I mean, it is quite interesting. Because there's medication that we use in cardiovascular disease, probably take it for granted  inaudible 00:46:24 . ACE inhibitor, statin, maybe not the SGLT-2 inhibitor as much, but yeah, you kind of take those granted now. In fact, their   00:46:36  is a lot higher."
"I mean, we pretty much give statins... not to everyone, but we assume that there's quite a good proportion of patients that are on either an ACE inhibitor for their blood pressure or they've had heart disease or kidney condition or diabetic, they're on ACE inhibitors. And again, with statins, they're given to a lot of people with these conditions. But they obviously are  inaudible 00:47:05 . Maybe my statistics are so bad, but the NNT's obviously quite high. So then the one that you're mentioning with the 80, I guess it does sound quite good. I guess now you've alerted me to the previous statin NNT, then that'd be good to maybe compare it to say like, ""Oh statins, number needed to treat of 164. Well, actually this triple inhaler, physical therapy has actually lower number needed to treat than a statin."" So I  inaudible 00:47:42 ."
"I mean, I think they would get the concept of it, it's just that it's not something that we use very regularly. I mean, I don't think I've ever discussed it, ever a number need to treat number, in general practice since working. But I think if it was mentioned, like if you treat 80 people, you prevent one death, compared to if you treated someone with LABA/LAMA, then if you maybe spelled it out  inaudible 00:48:37 , and that might be more convincing. And then say that compared to statin, or this much better than a statin that would probably work it over or sell it better."
"Yeah, I mean, I think I've appreciated that there is a link. Yeah, I mean, especially after the exacerbation and the heart disease and stroke slide."
"I mean, I guess the  inaudible 00:50:14  was quite interesting. But the reason why the exacerbation risk after... the risk after exacerbation one was important, I guess, was because as GPs, we probably see these COPD exacerbations the most, of all the COPD patients. We were the ones who give them the steroids or antibiotics, and then I guess we'd have to be considering risk of MI or stroke after that. So I guess that's why that one stood out for me. Yeah."
"I probably will, having read it, I would probably just look at how we can optimize their cardiovascular disease better, in terms of their medications, et cetera."
"Well, I mean, that'd be good. Of course, it'd be good."
"Yeah, it sounds like someone has got something to market, was going to try to bring something to market. I mean, obviously I'm sure you know that there are triple therapies already out there."
"Again, if they were already on a triple therapy and then a new inhaler came out saying that this triple therapy is better because it's got better cardio disease-"
"I mean, it's tempting. It's interesting, because in theory, I don't know, if they're using the same, say, ingredients, if they're using the same steroid LABA and LAMA, and it's just packaged in a different way, then in theory it shouldn't make too much difference to their cardiovascular. It's just that maybe the previous inhaler didn't do the study on cardiovascular disease and then this new one has, and then they've got a proven study."
"It's had. I guess it's a matter of, because in the UK, we have to follow the NICE guidance and in terms of prescribing guidance, to make sure that the inhalers... that what we're prescribing is cost effective. So if inhalers, the first inhaler that he's on already is like 30 pounds, but then this new inhaler comes out 60, 70 pounds, and then... Not that I think of the cost, but obviously NICE think about the cost and tell us what to prescribe. So it's a balance. If I could prescribe the newest, most advanced inhaler or prescription drug every time I obviously would, but it's just, a lot of is our hands are tied by what we can prescribe."
"Yeah, it probably would make a difference, but then again, it goes back to whether these other people did the study or whether there was a direct comparison study. So if they did the new triple therapy versus the old triple therapy, and that they actually did a comparison between the two, and if there was a significant difference then probably... I don't know, you'd probably would like to prescribe the new one."
"No, it was actually quite informative. I'm assuming all the studies are true, but it seems quite informative, I guess, yeah. I hope I haven't made GPs look too stupid in UK."
"Oh, I see. Okay, fair enough. I hope I don't make GPs in general look bad then."
How are I'm fine. It just seems to be talking twice. Do I need to put my phone down?
Do I need both my mobile phone and the computer?
"I'd prefer to use the computer, I think, because my battery's sort of a bit low on my phone, that's why. But, anyway..."
" inaudible 00:01:23  Something's happening. Okay. All right, I think I'm okay."
"Sorry, you cut out there. Interactions between...?"
"I'm a general practitioner. I see basically all patients, but I have a special interest in diabetes and dermatology and cardiovascular medicine."
"I'd say the ones I see tend to be moderate or severe, because the nurse would normally... The mild ones don't really come to the GP. They see the GOPD nurse and they just tick along."
"Most of them were, are on either dual or triple. I can't give exact numbers because every patient's unique. If they're struggling on dual therapy, then we might use triple therapy. If they're not too bad on triple, we might actually go back to dual therapy, or LAMA/LAPA, and leave out the steroid element. It depends on the patient entirely. I cannot tell you numbers. I don't know."
"They're becoming more and more breathless, their quality of life is just terrible. They're tired all the time. They tend to be a bit depressed with their breathlessness and they want some help."
"If they haven't had any exacerbations and their breathlessness is fine, then I don't think we need to include the steroid. It depends completely on the patient. If there's an asthma overlap as well, then you'd want to leave them on the steroid."
"We get a really good history. Have they got a cardiac history? Is this cardiac or respiratory or combination, difficult to say? The big thing is smoking history. If there's any asthma history. If there's any history of coronary vascular disease or that sort of thing. Could this be anginal, could this be. Another cause of  inaudible 00:07:55  anemia. So, good history."
"Then, if they're a heavy smoker,  inaudible 00:08:03  bronchitis attacks and  inaudible 00:08:07  on examination and you're thinking, okay, they might have COPD, so you'll send them to the asthma nurse, COPD nurse, who will do some spirometry. The spirometry might confirm or help with the diagnosis, and then you might want to do a chest x-ray as well, to see what's happening with their lungs."
"Sometimes we will do an ECG. If we're thinking this might be cardiac, we'll try them on something. Usually something like a short acting agent, or I tend to go straight onto something like  Braltif 00:08:46 , a long acting muscarinic agent, or possibly something like Incruse and then move up. It depends on... So that's how it would happen, the diagnosis."
"Their smoking history and sort of hyperinflation on examination, and it's generally getting worse, their breathlessness. Not associated necessarily with swelling of the legs or fluid overload on the lungs. Also,   00:09:36  chest infection could could be a sign."
"If there's a chest pain associated with it, if they've got a past medical history of ischemic heart disease or hypertension, if they've got high cholesterol, family history of it. Usually, a lot of that would be available from the GP notes just to quickly access from their summary, from their patient's summary. Yeah. If there's anemia in the past or renal problems, if there's kidney damage and they might be anemic, making them of breathless, then that would... It so much depends on who's sitting in front of you at that time. You're also looking at their age. How long have they had smoke exposure, if at all,? Have they had asbestos exposure, are there pets at home? Lots of things that you ask in the history."
"No, not necessarily, unless if they're heavy smokers."
"Yeah. If they then get referred to a cardiologist and this cardiologist can't really find fault, then you're thinking oh, I forgot about the respiratory side. That can happen sometimes. Or you're thinking this must be a respiratory. You've worked that up and then you realize, oh no, this is cardiac. Or sometimes it's a combination."
" inaudible 00:11:42  then possibly refer for exercise stress test. I'd refer to the chest pain clinic, because the breathlessness might in fact the angina. So you'd refer to them. That's cardiological process and they get seen quite quickly. That would include an ECG, and blood tests. Basic blood tests."
"The most common would be cardiovascular obesity, hyperlipidemia, immobility, lack of strength. No, that's not really  inaudible 00:12:48  frailty, you know,"
"No. The primary person for respiratory would be a respiratory nurse. For the heart side, it tends to be the GP at the moment. We do have nurses that do some blood pressure and ECG monitoring, but they... It's still defaulted back to the GP, the clinical."
"Do you know, I know that the risk is very high, but it doesn't always hit home when I'm doing the COPD. I'm not thinking, oh, they have a cardiovascular risk, but I should be. They tend to be heavy smokers with the cardiovascular risk, just inherently. It's a new way of thinking it, rather than compartmentalizing, is actually looking at it as overlap."
"Not as much as one would think, because each person... like I  inaudible 00:14:33  will occasionally think, well, this one's not really responding and I think it sounds a little bit odd. I'll send back to the GP who then thinks, oh, this might be angina. It's not really standard procedure for us to be looking, but on reflection we ought to be doing it in all of the patients with COPD."
"A lot of them might have a bit of heart failure, a bit of hypertension, possibly have a heart attack or stroke, possibly have diabetes. Tend to be... A lot of them are overweight and more and more immobile, and as a result much more increased frailty, which increases your risk of heart attacks and strokes and all that kind of thing, anyway."
Say that again? I just didn't quite understand the question.
"Definitely. I think a lot of COPD patients are under underdiagnosed. It's the other way around. I would say our cardiovascular thing is quite high alert, and then the COPD happens to be on a side, because they're breathless, and the breathlessness isn't attributed to the heart failure that they have, or the angina or whatever it is..."
"Yeah. If their breathlessness cannot be... if the management has been optimized and they're still very breathless and then you realize, oh, they're smoker. Maybe they've got a bit of COPD. I think the heart side of things is well managed. It's just that we don't always think about COPD."
"Yeah. You definitely don't want to give them anything that'll make their heart disease worse, or have ill effects, have cardiovascular side effects. You don't want to give them anything like that that actually increases their problem with the cardiovascular side. You want to make sure it's safe. You want to make sure it's effective, that it actually works, that you're just not adding something for the sake of it. And you want to make sure that the patient's life improves as a result."
Yeah. I'm more wary with Theophylline. Not that I ever use it.
"Yeah. That's secondary care initiated. It's sort of third or fourth line. It's really right down at the bottom. It's scraping the barrel a bit, but I'm more wary of that. I'm also wary of high dose steroids because of the pneumonia risk, and if they then have pneumonia, then their heart disease often gets decompensated and they die from the decompensated heart disease."
"I can't think of any particular inhalers that have got increased cardiovascular risk. I know there was one that was indicated, and I've forgotten. But I think the trial showed that there isn't really an increased risk, but I'm not sure now. Was it Spiriva? I think it was Spiriva that was implicated. Tiotropium, but I'm not quite sure if that's the case anymore."
"There is some recent data  inaudible 00:20:57  COPD properly, the cardiovascular disease improves, the mortality improves, but I wasn't particularly aware of that until fairly recently,"
"There is some evidence from some products that say the COPD... saying that if you manage the COPD better, then mortality would improve.   00:21:26  But that's fairly recent information that has come to light for me. It wasn't something I routinely thought about, but I'm starting to now, because it's come to light that if you treat COPD properly  inaudible 00:21:39  improve."
"If they've got cardiovascular disease, their chance dying is much higher."
"Their mortality goes right up if they've got heart disease and COPD, but most of them have got a little bit of heart disease anyway, just by the fact that they've been probably a heavy smoker, if they are, if it's smoking related."
What would make me refer a COPD patient to a cardiologist? Is that what you're saying?
"Only if I'm suspecting heart disease that I've not diagnosed, and I want to have aid with diagnosis."
I don't routinely refer COPD patients to a cardiologist? No.
"No, not necessarily. They often just say non-cardiac... Cardiac cause not found, back to your GP."
"Exactly. So, we are becoming people that have to take a responsibility. As soon as somebody's washed their hands with the patient, then it's back to us. And this happens regularly in all areas of general practice. It's not particular to cardiologists, or respiratory physicians, or renal physicians, or whatever. There is... Some of the physicians are working more collaboratively. There are renal, cardiac, and diabetologists who are starting to work more collaboratively, but I've never really seen the respiratory and the cardiologist doing that, locally anyway."
"I think they totally interrelated, I just haven't particularly thought of that, formalized it in my head. But now I'm starting to. I think it was the cardiovascular overlap with COPD, I've read articles, and there was something about one of the inhalers. I've forgotten the name. Trick-...   00:25:01 "
"  00:25:01  AstraZeneca inhaler? That's a new inhaler that's more environmentally friendly, that actually showed improvement in mortality in the people that were treated for COPD. But, it hadn't really registered until I actually thought about it, and I said yeah, obviously."
"Okay, they're usually smoking... there's a smoking link. It's usually if they're putting a strain on their heart, because of their lack of their breathlessness, they're going to keep on exacerbating that problem and increase their risk of heart failure and so forth. So, and the other way around, if you've got a heart that's not pumping very well, you're going to get more and more breathless, and it's just a vicious circle."
"I think, to some extent. If they've got a cardiovascular risk, that's not going to go away you, but it'll improve... It'll prevent more rapid decline, I guess."
"Yeah. If somebody's got atrial fibrillation and you don't treat it properly, they're going to get more and more and more breathless, less oxygen. And the COPD will get worse and worse and they're going to get more immobile, they're going to get infection and pneumonia as a... you know? So, they are interlinked."
"Yes. Because of cardiovascular disease, there might be an associated anemia or an associated heart failure, or something that's making their breathlessness worse. Yeah. So I suspect that if you've got a decent blood pressure, you've got a good pulse and so forth, because part of the blood pumping around better, your lungs are going to then function better. Because of the oxygen carrying, and so forth."
"It seems to be buffering. Oh, there we go. I can see it. Yep."
Hmm. Okay. It's saying that cancer and heart  inaudible 00:29:29 
"It's saying that heart and cancer related deaths represent a substantial proportion of reported causes of death in COPD. Okay? The cardiac related is quite variable depending on which style which study you're looking at. In the LHS study, they're not mentioning that many cardiac tests, it's mainly cancer. And then in the Europe study it's equal. And in the Torch study it's higher."
"And then in the Uplift, it's lower. It's variable."
Which one is this? The Euroscope? That one?
"Well, I'm looking at the numbers. It's significantly less numbers they used compared to all of the others. So I'm thinking, oh, maybe I don't believe this quite."
"I find I think it's a little bit weird. They're saying that statement at the top, that COPD has a twice greater risk of having CVD. That's enough for me. All this other stuff, I don't quite know the difference between the red and the blue. What they're trying to say. It's a bit all over the show, and I like bullet points. This is all confusing to me. I don't know quite what they're trying to say, and I'm working it up... If you spend time working it up, but I haven't got the time to do that."
So what's 140%. Why 140? I don't understand. How can you get more than 140%?
"Oh, I see what you mean? I didn't understand that. Okay. All right."
"I don't like this at all. The top line's fine with me, but I'd want the evidence. Is this from the Euroscope study, or what study are they talking about?"
"It makes me think that we need to definitely be looking out for CVD, as well. And treat both. Treat both well."
They overlap and good treatment of both would complement. Possibly even it could more than double.
"Now you see, I didn't actually know that having a COPD exacerbation increased your heart attack risk. I mean, your CV risk. I did know that having COPD exacerbation increased your death risk."
"Yep. But, I didn't know it was because of COPD. I don't know where this comes from, now. Okay, MI and stroke. You mean having COPD and more chance of having MI and stroke, yeah?"
"Quite often you'll have somebody admitted with a COPD exacerbation and their die from a heart attack. Then on the death certificate, it's MI and then comorbidity of COPD. It happens a lot."
"Whenever I admit somebody with COPD that's really, this is their 14th exacerbation, I'm thinking, will they come out alive?  inaudible 00:35:56  I do sometimes think maybe this time they won't come out alive. That is in my thought process anyway."
"And that's not even thinking of what the cause of death is, it's the fact that the exacerbation has put a huge pressure on their immune system and their heart and their circulatory system, their renal function. Everything."
The whole body is a machine that's working as a whole. Yeah. Yeah. It's not something... I'm not thinking this is rocket science.
"Oh, that's a bit scary. I didn't know that. I'd want to know a little bit more about the study, if it's robust. And I'd want to know, should we be putting them on anticoagulants?"
Probably prothrombotic process. With any infection. It doesn't have to just be COPD. You produce more fibrin and all that kind of thing that increases your risk of stroke.
"Well, I find that a bit scary. Yeah. Because it's not always something that's computed in my brain."
"The thing about this is that COPD is just one manifestation of a stress on the body. So, if someone is admitted with a urine infection and they've got sepsis, that's going to put stress on their body and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Any infectious process will do this. And one of them happens to be COPD. Yeah?"
"So, I'm thinking one could make a blanket statement that's just related to COPD. Any major stress, even if flu can do this. A viral illness that's not even related with someone's normal lungs, they can come up with having a increased risk of having an MI if they've got underlying heart disease that was undiagnosed. You know, that's the   00:38:53  thing."
"That using dual therapy LAMA/LABAs definitely have superior risk of... sorry, decreased risk of mortality versus those with steroids, or just steroid/LABA combination. That's what I'm reading here."
"No, because having steroids onboard increases the risk of infection and pneumonia. Yeah. And if they've got COPD, it's not necessarily going to get improved with, with an ICS."
"Okay. That the triple therapy is more advantageous in terms of all-cause mortality versus the LAMA/LABA therapy and the ICS/LABA therapy. The other way around. Ah, okay. But does it say all-cause mortality... Does that include pneumonia?"
"So maybe it's the anti-inflammatory effects of the inhaled steroid that's decreasing that mortality. Yep. Because I was just talking about... with infection. Maybe that steroid. Also, if you think about COVID, they were using Dexamethasone to stop that massive thrombosis  inaudible 00:41:37  -prone inflammatory condition. So maybe yeah,  inaudible 00:41:40  Okay."
"It's something I was completely unaware of. That's the first thing. So using triple therapy... Actually, we are using more and more triple therapy, and that reassures me now, that using triple is actually a good idea."
"Sorry, you were cutting  inaudible 00:42:25 "
"What's making me think differently is, I'd want to know the study. I'd want to know who they compare... How long it went, for how many patients, and the robustness is of the studies there. Or, is it just a one off for study that's all over... just happens to show this in five patients or something. That's the first thing. Then, I want to know... Then I'd also be much, much more inclined to prescribing triple therapy before just LAMA/LABAs."
"It just shows that in the five used to give LAMAs separately and then LABAs separately, and then we used to give a bit of steroid and then we started combining steroid and... what's it called?"
"LABA. Yeah. And now, it's just evolving all the time, and it's just for us to keep up to date, I think."
I'm taking from this. Yep. Because I was always worried about the steroid component increasing your pneumonia risk.
"Okay. Again, not huge numbers, but enough."
"That using product X, which is the triple decreases your risk of a heart attack. Oh, your sort of major heart attack event causing death and mortality compared to the dual therapy, LAMA/LABA."
"There's too much  stuff 00:45:16  there. Too much, you know... But it does look like that the LAMA/LABA increases your risk in all of these parameters except stroke, you know? Yeah. Yeah?"
"Yeah, versus the LAMA/LABA, but not necessarily that much versus the ICS/LABA."
"There's no difference. And that I find quite surprising, because it is a respiratory drug that you're using."
"Because there might not be added benefit to having the inhaled steroid for the respiratory side, but the inhaled steroid might be helping with the cardiovascular inflammatory response. Don't know. I'm guessing."
"Yeah. I'd be thinking maybe that steroid has a little bit of a role to play. Which I, because I've always been steroid phobic in past, I guess so, now."
"Sure. It's quite a significant difference. 62% is a significant difference. Even 50% is, so quite impressive."
"Well, I've never thought about it, but respiratory drug is going to decrease your risk of having a cardiovascular death, but it all makes sense."
"Because if you're going to stop an exacerbation, you're going to put less stress on the body. The more stress you have on the body and the immune system, the more prothrombotic and the more inflammatory response and the more chance of having a heart attack or stroke or whatever."
" inaudible 00:49:38  I want to see how big the numbers were and was it a specific area that they looked at? I mean, was it a one country study? Was it a global study? I'd want to know how robust the data is."
"Sometimes people will say, cause of death, heart attack, and then secondly COPD, but it might have been the COPD that killed them, and they happen to have a heart attack as well, or that both of them killed them, you know? And just by going by death certificates might just be a bit dubious, because we sometimes get cause of death wrong. Because not everyone has a post mortem. You see what I'm saying?"
Quite. That's true. That's what I'm trying to say.
"And we should be thinking about them as both being responsible. It's just because we tend to box things up. I think intrinsically GPs do tend to think more holistically. We do, and that just is inherent our blood, but I don't think the specialists necessarily see it that... Or, once they've been referred to a specialist, then they want their speciality consulted. They don't always look at it very holistically. But as I say, there is some overlap now with some specialities that are now talking to each other more, because we do   00:51:09  our bodies interconnected."
"Okay. We get very excited about all the statin and the heart protection, the hope study and the Empa-Reg and all that, but this looks even better than any of those. So, I think this is quite groundbreaking in some way. I don't know what the mechanism is, how come it's happening like this. Has anyone come up with any theories? Is it just the selection of patients they took into the study? How robust is that study?"
"I'm surprised that it's quite significantly higher than the other product that contains ICS-LAMA/LABA. Now, why would that be?"
"Maybe the ICS-LAMA/LABA study, the yellow one, wasn't looking at cardiovascular mortality."
"Yeah, exactly. Or if it was, maybe it depends on what the death certificate said  inaudible 00:53:10 "
Have they done... Is that a head to head trial?
"Well, then I don't really trust this data."
"All three of them, because I don't think that Product X is necessarily going to be that much more superior, if the ingredients are very similar."
"Yeah, possibly. At the moment, we're not using that many triples and basically the ones that we are using are Relvar, Albuterol, and what else? Oh, Trelegy and Trimbow, but Trimbow less so because it's not so eco-friendly. And, sometimes we're using the odd one, I think that new one from AstraZeneca called Trick-, Trick- something."
"Yes, very much so. Because, comparing it to those massive studies that were those CV studies, those landmark CV studies done years ago, it's doing pretty well. Very well. Even the other products, product Y. Product Y's even impressive. Product X is very impressive."
"Which makes...  should 00:55:37  make me want to think twice about using, well, not think twice about using them."
"Now, it was always the ones that were just getting worse and worse with their breathlessness and exacerbating. So then, I'd use the triple, and doing the scoring and stuff. But, now I'm thinking maybe we should be using this one right from the beginning."
"No, no. When they start deteriorating. When they're moderate, rather than severe."
"When they get to MRC score about two or three, or even possibly one to two? I don't know."
"You don't want them to exacerbate. Once they've exacerbated, that's not good for them."
"Yeah, but I'm not saying that's the guidelines, and I don't want to overstep. I tend to be a guideline for follower."
"  00:57:18  follower. But, yeah. My temptation would be to start really early."
"Yeah. If the study, if the study is robust."
"No, that's fine. Was it okay? I hope I didn't talk a lot of nonsense."
Sorry. I keep... Trixeo. Yeah. Is that the one?
"This is unusual I have a half day, but usually I come home later, but I just rushed this morning so I could make it. But, well   00:58:56 "
"So I don't need to do that. Yeah, you can do that."
"Hello, and thank you, the respondent is now on the line. Moderator Mindy, go ahead please."
"I do non-invasive cardiology, kind of take a broad spectrum of a lot of different things, but I deal with basically the full gamut of cardiology, with pulmonary hypertension. I also do diabetes, I work well with all the other specialists. I am in a single specialty group affiliated with three hospitals and I sees both inpatient outpatient."
"I would say good proportion of them would have comorbidities at least half, probably 30% diabetics, I see the full gamut between dealing with patients with hypertension, hyperlipidemia to people with concomitant disease, with COPD, with coronary disease, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure. Yes, we also do invasive testing as well, I work alongside with my colleagues in that regards."
"Typically, I will work alongside with other doctors, but I'm a little bit more aggressive with some of those things. Pulmonary hypertension, diabetes, I'll tend to be more aggressive with smoking, I'll be much more aggressive with even patients who've had strokes and so forth. Anything that can be in the cardiovascular realm or things that can commonly affect the heart, I am more aggressive."
"I see what medications are on, I would definitely communicate with your primary doctor or their endocrinologist. Sometimes it'll require a phone call, it always requires some type of letter communication or fax or something to that degree, or via integrated EMR. Sometimes I will just end up putting them on certain types of medications that I feel are better suited for them that in the past would've been a quote unquote medication for the primary care doctor or whatever else. I try to get them started on some of these medications."
"SGLT2 inhibitors typically are the ones that I tend to be more aggressive with. I will recommend certain GLP-1 agonists, I don't do the GLP-1 agonist as much because people tend to be a little bit more apprehensive about injections and so forth. I will be much more aggressive about SGLT2's, even medications that need to be refilled, I will refill the patient's medications for them from their doctor and so forth."
"I do EKG and echocardiogram, certainly a very thorough physical examination. I look at their smoking history, I will order a chest x-ray, probably some blood work as well, and get a sense in terms of the basic overall sense in what's going on with those regards."
"Okay. Of course, they get post-ops off and so forth."
"In the initial, I'll kind of do all of those to start with, then I'll still continue to focus more on the cardiac aspect. The pulmonary aspect, that tends to be a little bit more delayed after the cardiac."
"Most of the times I will get people started on certain things, let's say if a person has pulmonary hypertension, I will get a CT angio and things like that. If there are other things, such as they need bronchodilators or whatever else, or I suspect that they've had a long smoking history, then I'll refer them to pulmonologist to get pulmonary function testing."
"It's always in the back of my mind, it's oftentimes hard to tease out, anytime somebody does have shortness of breath and I can't fully explain it based on something that's very obvious cardiac wise, so they don't have active ischemia on a stress test or they don't have valvular heart disease, I will have them go for lung testing."
"I certainly try them on the cardiac medications first and see how they feel. I'll try them on certain type of inhalers in addition to say, ""Hey, listen, this is what I think you have, but let's try the inhalers just to see if this makes a difference."" I kind of take it concomitantly and see what works."
"With COPD particularly we do worry a little bit about pulmonary hypertension from the lung status, and that adds to a mixed picture. A lot of people you can get, when you do work a pulmonary hypertension in these patients, it clouds the picture a little bit."
"Certainly, it's not as straightforward, I have to work a lot closer with a pulmonologist to get certain things addressed."
"I tend to be more concerned about people for ischemia standpoint, if they have no coronary disease, it tends to be a more of a warning sign for me to watch them a little bit closer. Yeah, when they're short of breath, it complicates things more so."
"I feel comfortable, it's just a matter of me needing to be on top of them a lot more. I need to make sure that the pulmonologist and I are in frequent conversation in regards to these things."
"I have, but now there's more and more medications with COPD that tend to be a little bit more complex, some of the newer ones and so forth. Once they get PFT's by the pulmonologist and they've been found to have some degree of COPD, the pulmonologist usually takes control. I will get them maybe started on certain medications, but the pulmonologist end up taking over."
"Just as I'm concerned about coronary disease and so forth, these patients, they do get bad COPD exacerbation, they get very concerned about them. Making sure that they also get their routine vaccinations and all these other things that you want to prevent them from getting hospitalized."
"Usually I get called in the hospital for those patients, if they've gotten to the hospital, because I work with those pulmonologists, they'll usually notify me and said, ""Hey, your patient came in. I don't think it's a cardiac issue, they came in with COPD, do you want to stop by and say hi?"" Like, absolutely."
"Just in the sense that I need to watch them more closely, I'll have them come and see me more frequently."
"I tend to be more concerned about ischemia in these patients. I tend to be more concerned about pulmonary hypertension, needing to maybe get more frequent ischemia evaluations or more frequent echocardiogram to assess their PA pressures."
"In general you're getting hypoxic, you're going to increase demand cardiac stress, increasing cardiac ischemia. Also, you're dealing with increasing pulmonary hypertension, they are intertwined. I do get concerned about those things. You also worry about RV dysfunction and needing to make sure there's now more and more of a push to recognize RV failure, they're all intertwined obviously."
"I think it can improve it, but it is still a risk, you're never going to reduce the risk to zero once you have COPD, the more well controlled the COPD certainly you're going to have less coronary events."
"Certainly if you're becoming short of breath from a cardiac reason that can exacerbate COPD as well, that needs to be well taken care of. It's confusing for the patients as well, if they're short of breath from coronary disease, that adds to more confusion and seeing the doctors more often and potentially maybe being placed on steroids or stronger medications. It's actually really important for them to be able to get everything set up properly, in terms of getting it all treated well."
"I do have some patients, certainly who have coronary disease, that's medically managed, but also have concomitant COPD and we're kind of stuck in those patients. We're doing the best we can, but you also want them to undergo rehab, either pulmonary cardiac rehab and they're limited, it is a frustrating situation."
"They're just too tired, they're just so winded and it's just a matter of trying to figure out, try to see which one should we target first? The COPD or the coronary disease? That's when I would work closely with the pulmonologist to get it both attacked."
"You have uncontrolled COPD, you're going to have increased arrhythmias, increased skin burdens, so yes. When they're in the hospital for COPD exacerbations, certainly you can get type two MI or increasing ischemic burden because they're hypoxic, so, yes."
"Yeah. That kind of goes along with what I was saying before, is that when you're getting these COPD exacerbations and your hypoxic... A lot of these people with COPD they're going to have concomitant coronary disease. They may have other things such as sleep apnea with A Fib and whatever else, it becomes more complicated. When you become hypoxic, you're going to have increasing ischemic events, you're also going to have increasing harmful rhythms, such as ventricular tachycardia, it's not surprising to me."
Kind of confirming what I already know. I feel like everybody with COPD needs to be seen by a cardiologists.
"Yeah. I'm just curious why it's so different, you're taking a look at the Euroscope versus the Uplift, I'm just curious what the study population was like that. The Euroscope also had the smallest patient population size."
No worries. Yeah. This all kind of makes sense.
"No. The statistic numbers, it always confirms the statistics. Yeah, coronary disease, heart failure, it really comes down to what is the oxygen demand? If you're either having decreased oxygen because of COPD or someone's choking you, or you have sleep apnea, or you have heart failure or ischemic disease, it's all basically oxygen mismatch, so it's not surprising."
If you take two different disease processes that can commonly affect that process you're going to have concomitant mortality.
"Just the numbers maybe look a little higher, I'm not sure the percentages, it's a very wide range, it's giving heart disease. 40% to 140%, that's huge. I guess it also depends on what they consider is a heart disease and what the condition of those patients are. That's a wide range as well, it's not completely surprising."
"Okay. This is kind of nice to see, the MI stroke. In general oxygen circulation, all that is intertwined with every single aspect through our entire body, particularly the cerebral vascular, you have your kidneys, you have your lungs, all that together. Not surprising that the risk of MI doubles within the first five days, because that's where the biggest hit is. It is interesting that the increase of stroke actually increases as the days go on rather than going down. I'm just wondering if it's just... Yeah. I find that interesting that it's kind of reverse for coronary and cerebral vascular."
"I don't recall data being presented in that regards, it's not surprising, it makes complete sense. Yeah, it's interesting to see that it's really that strokes can occur even maybe after discharge."
"I think it's a very good slide to inform cardiologists and pulmonologists and it makes sense. When you actually put numbers down, it actually is more convincing to healthcare professionals."
"Yes, because then they would actually refer doctors and refer patients to the cardiologist and the pulmonologist."
"Yeah. Makes you kind of concerned what a severe exacerbation would be like, makes you think even with a mild COPD exacerbation, there's probably going to have some degree, majority of those exacerbations would probably be in a more moderate range. What we would consider to be routine COPD exacerbation in the hospital, certainly if you're on ventilator and so forth, you get more concerned about these events. On a typical patient where you're admitting them for steroids and nebulizer treatments, yeah, we need to be concerned."
Yeah. I could see the cursor. It was just that the cursor was on the 49%. I just-
"It's okay. Yeah. It's actually, yeah, that's reassuring. Over the course of one year to see that and it does-"
"Just looking at product X and saying, added to standard of care medication in that it is showing to be significantly improvement in mortality. Even early on, even within the first four to eight weeks, you notice it's a substantial change."
"The only thing is that I would've liked to have seen ICS, LEB and LAMA, because you have LEB and LAMA and then you have ICS, LEBA, but you don't have ICS, LEB, LAMA. It makes me question, how much are the muscarinic antagonist contributing to this?"
"I'm just looking at the... No. The thing I did notice that Product X in comparison to the inhaled corticosteroids was a non significant 28% reduction. It plays more of a role of inhaled corticosteroids and I do like Product X, but it also just tells me, ""Hey, listen, I don't know how much bang for a buck you're going to get, if you had inhaled corticosteroid, and it muscarinic antagonist in there."" Makes me think that there's going to be even less of an improvement."
"I think those are good numbers, certainly not 20, but it's still fine."
"Yeah. To me, when you're comparing things to just a LABA LAMA, there is going to be a big difference. When you're comparing it to the inhaled corticosteroids in the LABA, there's not that much of a difference. It makes me question-"
"No, it makes me question, why didn't they study it with it? It makes me kind of doubt a little bit of why the trial was done this way. It poses some questions, is the big difference just because of inhaled corticosteroids."
"I'd like to learn more about Product X, but I'm also a little wary of the study."
"Between Product X and ICS, the big difference is all cause is total is you see a difference there, that's probably not statistically significant. Then you also see a difference in the cancer, everything else is pretty similar. It makes me think it's not so much cardiovascular cause that is the issue here, but maybe it's powered by cancer. It now makes you think, okay, what is it about Product X? Like why?"
"That's a very hard thing, anytime you try to look at cancer and see if a medication is going to have decreased risk of cancer, that opens up a whole other slew of things. It's hard to assess why you would have a decrease in cancer risk, like cardiovascular, respiratory, COPD, that I can all understand, but right now all of those are identical. The only thing that seems to be powering the all cost total is probably the cancer. It poses some questions, I don't understand why cancer would be decreased with that medication."
"There's no difference in CV death, either between Product X-"
"That's the thing. The way I'm looking is that, most of my patients with COPD would not just be on LABA LAMA, they would be on ICS as well, because that's standard of care here. The thing that bothers me with this is that you have two arms that's not fully standard of care and now you do Product X with the ICS LABA and LAMA. You're not comparing just Product X to an identical thing without Product X."
ICS LABA LAMA and that's not there. That's not in one of the arms.
"Yeah, I'm not so convinced that I'm going to rush out and start patients on this medication."
"Yeah. I'm using triple therapy anyway. Yes. I don't see one, on the far left, I don't know how much better that is than just triple therapy, there's nothing there that makes me to suggest at it."
Okay. I wasn't sure if it was Product X plus triple therapy or if it was just?
"Oh, okay. All right, then I'm sorry, I was confused with that then."
"Okay. In that case, then that's fine, I thought it was a different medication, I was a little confused."
"Yeah. I would end up treating anyway, I guess it's just more convenient then if it's a triple therapy in that regards."
"It does have an all cause total. Quite frankly at that point, I don't see much harm in it, in using that, I'd be more inclined to use that anyway. I have a lot of these patients on these types of medications anyway, yeah, I'd be fine with it."
"My takeaway from all this is a lot of these patients are going to be on triple therapy regardless and now if you have a single agent that does all that, it's just much more convenient. The data is actually good, I'd be more inclined to use it."
"Yeah, you're teasing out the cardiovascular death, that certainly looks more appealing. Yeah, I would be more inclined based on that slide to use the medication."
"When you're showing higher numbers, it always looks better."
"It's sort of both of them. All cause mortality can encompass a lot of different things. When you have a huge number in all cause mortality, you're already very impressed. That's kind of what people talk about is mortality and morbidity. Reduction in CV deaths is not as catchy, granted the numbers are higher, so it's more impressive. Yes, when you're showing a reduction of 62% in CV death that's huge, I'd want both."
"I would be much more inclined to tell patients that they need to start using these medications and to ask their pulmonologist to go ahead and start this medicine and so forth, I'd be much more inclined to doing that."
"I do tell them that they need to talk to the pulmonologist about optimizing certain medications and so forth. I do say maybe you can try being on a steroid or doing something else and then talk to your doctor about it. I don't typically... Any of these type of medications, the brand name medicines, I typically am not the one who is prescribing it."
"I would usually defer because with these type of medications, there's such a difficulty getting these medications approved and they usually do not get approvals from cardiologists."
"I see what you're saying it's basically comparing it to other big studies and trying to show that it's now considered to Product X or even Product Y, any of those type medications should be considered under forefront of any cardiologist when you're trying to deal with cardiovascular mortality."
"It was actually good that they put in the EMPA reg outcome study because the first three studies are typically cardiac only, the EMPA reg now you're dealing with diabetes and now you're dealing with COPD. It's showing that cardiologists can't just be full only on the typical heart medications."
"I think it's good in the sense that doctors, particular cardiologists, need to be aware of certain things. What ends up happening is some cardiologists are more and more concerned about angering the pulmonologist by maybe going onto their quote unquote territory."
"No, I think I'd just be much more inclined towards suggesting these types of patients and just looking towards COPD as a real risk in cardiovascular health."
Yeah. Yeah. You know what? It kind of exposes something in terms of showing where there have been other things that cardiologists can do and is addressing it. I think that's good.
"Okay. Hello everyone, and thank you for waiting. I now have your moderator, Mindy, on the line. Mindy, go ahead."
And you said that this is going to be an hour or more than that?
"Oh, no. I thought I had to turn my webcam on, but it's all good."
Sure. So I currently practice as a cardiologist. I also specialize in cardiovascular imaging. I spend about 85 to 90% of my time providing clinical care for patients. I work at a tertiary medical center that's affiliated with a medical school.
"I do both outpatient and some inpatients as well, so."
"High blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, lung disease, including COPD, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic kidney disease. Yeah. I think those would be the major ones."
"I guess all of them, but it really depends on the patient's symptom of what they're presenting with, but I would say higher up on the list would obviously be cardiovascular risks like hypertension, diabetes."
"Obviously, if they're presenting with dyspnea or decreased exercise tolerance, then obviously associated pulmonary diseases are also high up on the list."
"Yeah. Because, I mean, there is a lot of overlap between pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. I mean, the symptoms can present very similarly. They can occur concomitantly. I mean, obviously, as a cardiologist, my job is to take care of the cardiovascular aspect, but at the end of the day, you are treating a patient and not a disease. So one can ask to take a step back and make sure that we're sort looking at all the possibilities that could be feeding symptom and to treat their symptoms that they're presenting with."
"So everything from diagnosis to treatment, counseling. That can be, obviously, lifestyle modification and also referral to an endocrinologist."
"I think it's done in collaboration. If their diabetes is well-controlled, they might go to see their... Let's say they've had a heart attack and they're diabetics, but their diabetes is pretty well-controlled, they'll probably come to see me more often than their endocrinologist."
So it really just depends on the patient profile.
Obesity. Obviously that plays in very closely with cardiovascular risk factors. What else? I think that would the main one.
"Yeah. So for me, obviously, I want to first figure out if there's any cardiovascular disease that's leading to their shortness of breath. So typically I'll get an echocardiogram, a stress test to evaluate their functional capacity, as well as ischemic evaluation. Based on their stress test, I might get a coronary CT angiogram for further evaluation or sometimes I just get a coronary CTA as a first line if they're not able to exercise. Then obviously on the echo, look for cardiac function, any valve disease and pulmonary artery systolic pressure. That's estimated using echocardiogram. And then blood work. You want to make sure they're not anemic. I often check a BNP on patients' breath to see if there's any component of volume overload."
"And then, usually I'll order a chest x-ray as well to see what's going on in their lungs. And  inaudible 00:08:44  angiogram  inaudible 00:08:45  part of the lung, so you get some pulmonary evaluation to see if they have any  inaudible 00:08:52  changes, any evidence of  inaudible 00:08:56  or anything like that. I usually will screen my, especially obese, patients for sleep apnea as well, especially  inaudible 00:09:09  because that goes hand in hand. If everything checks out from the heart front, then I'll send them to a pulmonologist."
"Or if, based on my evaluation, I feel like there could be concomitant pulmonary issues as well."
"I mean, it depends on the patient, but echo stress labs is very routine and CT angiogram is... I would say, maybe about 50 to 60% of my patients with shortness of breath will get a CT angiogram."
As a cause of cardiovascular condition or a concomitant?
"Yeah. Closely. For example, if they have pulmonary hypertension, I got to make sure it's not because of some intrinsic lung disease  inaudible 00:10:58  congestive heart failure or something. And  inaudible 00:11:03  also plays a part because beta blockers are very commonly used in cardiology, and obviously can make the  inaudible 00:11:12  worse. So those two would be the main things. And if they have a smoking history, which obviously leads to cardiovascular disease but also pulmonary disease, in such  inaudible 00:11:28  we kind of have a high suspicion to work up both."
I'll usually at least order a chest x-ray and probably refer them for pulmonary function testing.
"Yeah. I think that 40% is predominantly COPD. I would  inaudible 00:12:32  about 35%. 5% ILD and stuff like that, but  inaudible 00:12:38  people who have a long history of smoking and have  inaudible 00:12:47  vascular disease, but then also have concomitant lung disease."
"It depends. I think peripherally I'm involved. Obviously, if they need their inhalers and stuff like that. If they can't go see a pulmonologist, I can always prescribe the basic inhalers, a rescue inhaler like albuterol or Atrovent, Spiriva. And also, I guess pulmonary hypertension is kind of like an overlap between cardiology and pulmonology. I have primary pulmonary, arterial, hypertension patients that I'll  inaudible 00:13:41  and the  inaudible 00:13:44  receptor and agonist. So for those, I'll probably take more  inaudible 00:13:49  but if it's COPD, I'll prescribe sort of the first line and then refer to the pulmonologist."
"I mean, I feel pretty comfortable. The main thing is getting PFTs and stuff for diagnosis, I think. It's just the diagnosis part usually requires PFTs and I don't do PFTs in my office, whereas echo stress tests are done in my office. I don't interpret PFTs anymore. That's the main reason, but prescribing inhalers, I'm very comfortable doing that."
"Yeah. I think it depends on the severity of each, right? So if their COPD is so bad that they're on home O2 and not able to walk and their coronary artery disease is just mild or they have mild hypertension, then  inaudible 00:15:22  COPD definitely takes precedence over the cardiovascular disease."
"I think, again, it depends on how severe their disease is. Obviously if they are  inaudible 00:15:53  significant therapy for their COPD like home O2 or whatnot, then obviously the concern is a lot higher. Whereas, if they just need an occasional rescue inhaler or just take Atrovent or something, then it's probably lower."
"A 100%. I think usually, my typical questions are chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath. So the breathing part is definitely an important symptom that I evaluate for. And then, I know the pulmonologist that I work with pretty closely, so if there are issues, I will definitely sort of find out from them as well. So it's a little bit of both."
"I mean, I think they're pretty interrelated. Usually the first organs that get impacted when your heart's not functioning properly is your lungs and your kidneys. Because let's say you have congestive heart failure, it's going to impact your lungs, or if you have pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease, that's going to impact your lungs. They also share some risk factors like smoking or... So I think that there's a significant association and correlation."
"I think it impacts the treatment a lot, because obviously it limits the use of beta blockers. Amiodarone is another commonly used medication that can lend to pulmonary fibrosis in patients who have atrial fibrillation. So I think it's more the treatment that's impacted. And then obviously in patients have, let's say, congestive heart failure. Yeah. I think then the treatment sort of gets limited if we can't give them beta block  inaudible 00:19:19 ."
"I think if it mobilizes the patient more. If the COPD is well-managed and the patient's able to exercise and lead a healthy lifestyle, I think it could definitely help improve cardiovascular outcome."
Let me think about that. Can well-managed disease improve COPD? I'm not sure. I don't know. I can't find a direct link. Yeah.
"Definitely. The first way around that you said that if your COPD is not well-managed, it's hard to implement any heart and healthy lifestyle changes. And obviously, if your oxygen's running low, it's usually not good for your cardiovascular system, because it lends to hypertension and the heart doesn't like being in a chronic hypoxic state, I mean, the whole body. I think that poorly managed COPD definitely impacts heart disease in those ways, but not for sure if heart disease impacts COPD that much."
Cardiac and cancer-related deaths represent substantial proportion of reporting. I see. This kind of just tells me that heart disease and COPD are very closely linked and a lot of these patients die of cardiovascular causes and cancer.
"I mean, I think it's not surprising to me because it's a very sort of familiar cohort of patients that I deal with. So I think that it makes sense sort of. The slide makes sense."
The latter. I think it kind of just validates what clinically sort of see in real life.
So cardiovascular comorbidity significantly increase the burden of COPD and risk of death. I see. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense.
"Basically that if you have COPD and then you add cardiovascular comorbidities on top of that, your outcomes are much worse than if you had COPD alone."
"And then additionally, also, if you just had cardiovascular disease alone, minus the COPD, you're probably better off."
"And again, it kind of goes along with what we see is... The more organs that are failing, the poorer your outcomes, basically."
Yeah. It's more in line with validating clinical experience.
"All right. So damage from COPD exacerbation goes beyond the lungs, the risk of CV complication such as... Risk of MI doubles within five days. Okay. Is this MI type 1 and type 2, or?"
"I mean, honestly, if it's both type 1 and type 2, I think that would make sense just because you see a lot of demand ischemia, meaning troponin elevation in patients who are admitted with COPD exacerbation. So I think if it's truly what I'm thinking, if it's both demand ischemia and true MIs, I think that would kind of validate what I know. And then the stroke, I guess, is kind of a little bit more surprising just because A, I'm not a neurologist, so I guess I'm not really seeing that much of the neurological complications, but also 40% is pretty high. It's significant. It's a lot. So that  inaudible 00:26:08 ."
"Oh. I said that's new to me, that it would be a 40% increase in the risk of stroke."
"I guess it just puts COPD in a much more grave list of conditions than I thought. Usually you don't think the COPD as something that leads to terminal outcomes or significant, meaning major adverse cardiovascular events. And I think that this definitely changes my view that COPD is kind of a risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including strokes, so."
"The MI not so much if it's truly both combining any troponin elevation. If you tell me MI plaque rupture, type 1 MI, then that would be a surprise, but I don't think my experience... I think it's probably both demand ischemia and type 1 and type 2 MI."
"Yeah. That's surprising to me, honestly, that just a moderate exacerbation could increase your risk by 40%. I mean, in an ideal world, I would also like to see the sample size of what the 40% is, how many patients were included in the analysis."
But I think that it definitely changes my view as to that moderate COPD can also have adverse outcomes like strokes.
"So product X reduce the risk of all cause mortality versus LAMA/LABA  inaudible 00:29:01  mortality. Okay. Product X is inhale triple combination of ICS/LAMA, long-acting  inaudible 00:29:11  receptors. Okay."
"Basically that this seems to improve all cause mortality, including, I guess, cardiovascular outcomes compared to sort of, I guess, what the standard of therapy now is, which is in the dark blue and the gray."
"I think it's encouraging. Obviously reducing mortality is a hard endpoint. It's a very defined endpoint in all clinical trials. And it seems like there's a 49% reduction and it's significant. Well, unadjusted, I guess it's significant. And then number needed to treat is not that high. I mean, it's 80. It's not super low, but it's not crazy high. So I think overall it's encouraging."
"No. But I think I would like to look at the raw numbers as well. How many people were enrolled in the trial, what the baseline characteristics were of the population  inaudible 00:30:55  trial. And obviously again, that 49% reduction in mortality, you kind of have to take into account what the total end was that gave that 49% reduction as well. So I think I would need more just of the raw data and table one in a clinical trial to better  inaudible 00:31:19  and evaluate the results."
"I guess it kind of goes along with what you showed in slide four, is that COPD exacerbation is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and treating it more effectively will reduce it. So it kind of goes along with the hypothesis."
"All right. Cardiovascular  inaudible 00:32:18  account for mortality.  inaudible 00:32:22  difference between  inaudible 00:32:24  incident. Okay. So summary all cause total... And I'm guessing the 28 is the end and then in the brackets is the percentage, right?"
"All right. I think, again, this kind of just adds on to the slide five that you showed me before."
"Oh. I was just going to say it kind of adds to sort of the data that you showed before. It's helpful to see the total number of patients that were included in each arm.  inaudible 00:33:46  obviously that it's a reasonably large trial. It's about 6,000  inaudible 00:33:57  patients in total. So I think it's overall compelling."
Yeah. I think it makes it more reassuring that the end was reasonably large. It's not like it's like  inaudible 00:34:18 . So I think it just sort of cements further the findings from the prior slide.
"Yeah. So it looks like the product X, it did better overall compared to LAMA and LABA when it came to  inaudible 00:35:15 , nonfatal MIs and cardiovascular death.  inaudible 00:35:22  nonfatal stroke. Then in comparison to ICS and LABA, which is the gray in the picture, in some places it looks like it did equivalent, which was nonfatal vascular death. And then I guess it was a little higher for  inaudible 00:35:49  compared to ICS and LABA."
Yeah. So it looks like it kind of falls in the middle somewhere.
Overall better than LABA and LAMA alone for sure.
"I'm not sure what would explain the nonfatal stroke, but I'm not sure why... It kind of goes against the fact that it reduces everything else, but not nonfatal stroke."
"And then if you look at the numbers on the left side. So the death was obviously the lowest for product X and ICS/LABA, which is sort of along with the graphs, and then just coming to... I guess you don't have the end of the strokes here on the left side. Just the-"
"Yeah. Because that would be interesting to see what the delta was. Is it just chance, random error, or is it something that  inaudible 00:37:09 . So that would be the other thing."
"I think it's a little puzzling to be honest, just because in the previous slide you had shown me that improving... Worsened exacerbations, even moderate, lead to poor outcomes. So you would think that treating the exacerbation would improve outcomes, but seemingly it doesn't. I'm not sure if there's a mechanistic explanation for that or the fact that... Yeah. I'm not sure. I don't  inaudible 00:38:25  explain that."
"Let me see. So product X showed a reduction in CV deaths. Honestly, it doesn't after looking at the previous slide. If you just showed it to me-"
"... without the slide six, I would've thought so, but I'm still sort of puzzled by the numbers I saw on the previous slide."
That stroke thing still doesn't make sense. I'm not sure why the... It just doesn't look like it fits the hypothesis. And are you including strokes in CV deaths or?
That's nonfatal stroke. So it wouldn't be included.
"Got it. Got it. Okay. And then, I guess you're comparing this to LAMA and LABA alone, but you're not comparing LAMA and ICS. So I think that's sort of the other thing. What's the benefit of giving three drugs versus two?"
Yeah. I'm just not sure why... It's kind of confusing to me why product X is not so much better than ICS/LABA.
"I don't know. I'm not sure why that is. But it still reduces some cardiovascular mortality, but then it doesn't reduce everything across the board. And I guess the stroke's confusing. So that's a little bit of a question mark."
"I mean, honestly, that would be very welcome news, but surprising nonetheless, just because we don't think of COPD treatments traditionally as improving cardiovascular disease  inaudible 00:42:32  beta agonist sometimes make it worse. They can increase your heart rate and your A-fib."
"I think it would be welcome news, but it would be surprising nonetheless."
Sure. All right. The magnitude of absolute risk reduction for mortality. Single inhaler  inaudible 00:43:05 . So what they're trying to say is that... So the reduction for studies  inaudible 00:43:23  is inhibitor SGLT2. And then you have mortality and a single inhaler  inaudible 00:43:33  therapy. So product Y is  inaudible 00:43:42 . So how is product X different from product Y? Oh. Yeah.
Like dosages? Is it dosages? I'm not sure.
Right. Right. No. I got that. But what's the difference  inaudible 00:44:32  between X and Y?
"Got it. I mean, I think that's encouraging. I mean, the army trial was a big... Yeah. The PARADIGM-HF trial, that was a big... Made a lot of waves and it became class one in the guidelines. So I think if you're showing that the COPD treatment can have a similar effect, I think that it's very promising."
"I think we would kind of have to expand our horizon. Now, as cardiologists, we're a lot more keyed into diabetes medications, right? Like SGLT2 inhibitors are out or like Ozempic or... So I think then this would just be another sort of arena that we kind of have to expand our thoughts on. I mean, obviously there's been a lot of buzz in the cardiology world with regards to like, ""Hey. There's these antidiabetic medications, but they also help improve cardiovascular outcomes regardless of the diabetes in heart failure patients."" And also with the weight loss, right? So I think it would be something similar to this where, ""Hey. There's these medications that are going to help your patients live longer lives."" So I think that it would just be sort of another thing that we have to consider when treating our patients."
"I don't think it would change collaboration, but maybe I would be more inclined to start something like this versus waiting for the pulmonologist to prescribe it."
It's like how I feel comfortable prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors.
"Instead of  inaudible 00:47:17 , I'll just..."
"I think I would feel comfortable initiating it, especially if they have a known  inaudible 00:47:48 . Especially if it's not a de novo diagnosis, I think I would feel comfortable."
"I mean, I think it's definitely very niche and I don't think we have much like it before, so I think it definitely addresses an under recognized and undertreated need."
"As opposed to their baseline, whatever standard treatment they're on now?"
Yeah. I think I would definitely prefer that they're on something that also improves their cardiovascular risk and outcomes as compared to just treating their lung  inaudible 00:49:27 .
No. I think this was very insightful and thought-provoking. So thank you.
"So I'm a GP, full-time GP partner. I don't have any accredited area of special interest, but I do have an unofficial interest on the respiratory lead for the practice, so that sort of goes on from that."
"I think if things are not going with the plan with the treatment that somebody is on, whether it be it's not enough drug or there are problems with the device or there are issues with compliance with the treatment, then we might want to simplify things and/or add in agents. So using a single device, Triple therapy is a way of doing that."
"Well, okay. Well, I mean, obviously there's a multitude of possible problems that might be causing the symptoms."
"So you essentially do a full history looking for any clues as to what system might be involved, whether it be the respiratory system or the cardiovascular system or other systems in the blood or something like that. So then you obviously then examine the patient thoroughly and try and get some more ideas that way from listening to the chest, the heart, taking the blood pressure, et cetera, saturations and so on, and then onto investigation. So you do some blood tests on them, you'd probably send them for chest x-ray, you might want to do an ECG. You might want to spirometry on them to look for COPD/asthma type issues and sort of put it all together, I suppose, when you've done all that and put all the results of everything together and go from there."
"I would be responsible for arranging all the investigations. I wouldn't perform the spirometry myself, but we have nurses in our practice who do that. So it wouldn't be done by me personally, but it would be done by one of my nurses who would do that. Yeah."
"Well, always, really. I mean, unless there is a compelling reason not to, then you would always look for possible cardiovascular problems because that is a common cause of breathlessness. So that's part of the sort of overall management and investigation stage. Yeah."
"Well, again, there's a number of possible options within the cardiovascular sort of umbrella, if you'd like."
"So, you'd be looking for what specific issue, it might be a rhythm problem, it might be a potential heart failure or something like that. So you'd be looking at trying to narrow that down and get a clearer idea of that, and then initiate treatment or refer to specialist depending on the nature of the problem and the severity of it, really."
"If the spirometry suggests COPD, then we would start them on inhaled treatments and monitor them accordingly. Yeah."
"I think you have to sort of take it on a case by case basis. And sometimes you are very much steered down the respiratory route and don't necessarily pay much attention on the cardiovascular side. You'd obviously reevaluate along the way, but yeah, I mean, you'd never kind of ignore other systems, you'd perhaps focus on, if everything pointed towards it being respiratory, you would focus on that side of it first and primarily."
Probably. Yes. Although I think there are still plenty of patients who have breathlessness for cardiac reasons rather than for lung reasons. So it does have to be kept very much in one's mind when you are dealing with patients with breathlessness.
"I mean, I would think it's probably cardiovascular disease to be honest, just because of the interplay with, that we've mentioned, with the lungs and the heart so closely connected."
"Yeah. I mean, I think the complexity of the problem, the symptoms, the breathlessness is greater when you've got people with lung disease and heart disease. So, it's always difficult to know what proportion, what contribution the two systems are making to sort of the overall picture. So, that's quite challenging. It can be quite challenging."
"And, sometimes you can sort of never quite get to the bottom of why someone is breathless and what particular aspects of their morbidity is causing it."
"Yeah. As I mentioned earlier, we do refer to specialists when necessary. I mean, it's probably not that common. I would say it's probably less than half the patients that we see in these situations, we end up referring because we have a lot of specialist nurses in our clinic and obviously lots of GPs and access to advice and things like that. So, we would generally deal with these patients in-house, but occasionally we would need to refer them on."
"I mean, I think probably you need to be careful when you are choosing the different sorts of drugs you're using. Whether there is going to be drug interactions or other side effects from drugs you might use for the cardiovascular system that can affect the breathing and so on. So it's kind of being very aware of the interplay between the two sides, the two systems and the medications that we use for them to make sure that we give the patients the best combination of treatments that we can."
"On top of the, okay. So cardiovascular risk factors, but not cardiovascular disease. You mean then?"
"Yeah. I mean, I think there is obviously a close correlation between when you get into having cardiovascular risk factors and other conditions such as chronic lung disease, and the outcomes are less favorable generally. So you need to be aware of that and making sure it's always in the front of one's mind that this person has got other conditions that may have a bearing on how you treat them or what their symptoms are like and so on. But yes, you need to be very much aware of that."
"I mean, I think that things like hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, lack of exercise, smoking obviously, those are the sort of main ones I think."
"I can't think of it  inaudible 00:17:03  I mean, obviously other than acute angina or severe cardiovascular problems, acute heart failure, MI, those sorts of things, but generally speaking, no, I don't think so."
"Yeah, I mean, I think some of the drugs that we might want to use for cardiovascular disease such as beta blockers and things like that, you can't really use those in lung disease patients, that tend to make them worse. So those are the main areas, diuretics you might use that, they can sort of affect the chest as well. Drugs that might cause anticoagulation, so maybe precipitate coughing up blood and things like that. So, most of the drugs that, yeah, some of the sort of antihypertensives can make you feel drowsy and sort of less energetic. So it makes it harder for them to exercise or harder for them to function, so different interactions like that."
"I mean, I think, all of what you say really, yes you might try a lower dose, you might try alternative drugs that don't necessarily, perhaps have the same effect or safer in these patients, but yeah, I mean it's sometimes a bit of a trial and error situation. That's sometimes where you might involve the secondary care team to get advice on alternative medication if that's the case."
"Yes. I think quite possibly. Yeah. I think if you are trying to improve one element of their potential cause of breathlessness, then, yes, you might want to be more proactive and add agents in sooner. Yeah."
"There are a number of things, I mean, I think as I mentioned, if you are having trouble with the drugs that you're using, if there are side effects to drugs or contraindications to the drugs, you might want to use, if there's poor response to drugs that you are using, the patient's not improving with those treatments. If you feel that more specialist investigations might benefit the patient  inaudible 00:20:45  hospital, then you might want to refer them to that. So there are number of different factors."
"Well, the specialist would see the patient or assess the patient and might suggest investigations that they would do or they might suggest an investigation that we could do, and then that will be done. Then, the specialist might suggest treatment trial of a drug or trial of a treatment to try and help the symptoms, and they might ask us to prescribe them or they might ask us to monitor them for the benefits of the treatment. They might ask us to do blood tests and monitor the other effects of the treatments. So there's a number of ways that we would share the care of the patient."
"Yes. Yes, absolutely. They will if they feel that there's a different problem that requires review by us or referral to somebody else, then they will let us know that. Yeah."
"Not really, I suppose. I mean, maybe if it's a breathing thing, they might suggest an ENT opinion is needed and they might say, can you please refer to ENT people or they might pick up some sort of abdominal problem maybe or something like that, or musculoskeletal issue that requires intervention. So it can be a variety of things really."
"That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that actually. I mean, my sort of intuition tells me that they would be more prone to getting exacerbations, but then I've not sort of noticed that anecdotally, I've not seen any evidence of it and I've not noticed it anecdotally. So I don't know the answer I'm afraid."
"I think if someone's got cardiovascular disease, then as we've discussed, it does affect the chest, it does affect the respiratory system. So that to me would make them more prone to getting lung congestion, you know, they may be on drugs which reduces their ability to fight of infections. There is a correlation between comorbidities and general health and wellbeing, so that's sort of the overall effect of having several comorbidities that might make an exacerbation more likely."
"Yeah. I mean, that certainly sounds entirely plausible."
"Yeah, I mean, again, it's not something I've got any evidence of, but my intuition again says that yes, if you can improve the respiratory functioning, then that would help with the cardiovascular side of it as well."
"Yeah. As just mentioned, I think that sounds likely. Yeah. I mean, I don't know what sort of size of effect it would be, but it certainly sounds that it would be beneficial rather than harmful, let's put it that way I think."
"None that I can think of. No. I was thinking when you asked the original question there, I can't think of any off the top of my head, but it's more sort of general feeling, I think."
"Yeah. I mean, I can think of one guy who I've seen recently, who has got both and yeah, I think he's getting worse and I think it's both of the problems that are sort of like almost feeding each other, so to speak. So it's kind of both sides, they're making the other one worse. You see what I mean?"
"He's got heart failure, congestive heart failure. So yeah that sort of makes him breathless as well."
"I think it's quite rare that, well not rare, it's perhaps less common particularly recently that we would put COPD, respiratory related cause of death on a death certificate. I think they tend to be more cardiovascular, dementia, cancer related. I think, there are still quite a few who get respiratory infections and that's the cause of death, the more I would think about that chart and look at the figures, it doesn't surprise me that the figures are quite high for cardiovascular causes of death in COPD patients."
"I guess perhaps if anything, it would maybe encourage you to think more of the patients with COPD rather than just the COPD on its own because you know a lot of these patients have got other conditions and I think it's important not to just focus on one condition in isolation. So, yeah, that's probably the main thing to think about."
Yeah. That's pretty high figures. Aren't they? I mean-
"Yeah. I mean, as we discussed earlier, it's confirming that having the two types of problems rather than just one is a significant risk for mortality."
"I guess it's a confirmation of what I thought and I think how I subconsciously would manage these people, but it's good to sort of have it confirmed if you'd like to know that's an important correlation and important additional risk when you have both problems at the same time."
"Yeah. Individuals with COPD having twice the risk of cardiovascular disease, that's quite surprising. I don't sort of recognize that necessarily in my caseload, but yeah, I mean I suppose if you drill down, it probably does bear out."
"Yeah, I mean, I would say they're similar. I would say the ranges are quite wide when they're given and I think, to me, that all looked relatively similar. So I wouldn't touch a great deal of significance of the actual figures, just roughly the roundabout, the sort of 40% mark or so would be where I would see it."
"Yeah. Again, I think that we've touched on this already, that doesn't surprise me, that there is a higher risk of cardiovascular, that's something I think we've seen and I guess it's recognized that that's the case that exacerbations like that do correlate with other causes of mortality and major events. Again, interesting to see the figures, but not as surprised in terms of the actual message."
"No, I mean, again, I think, you know, double the risk is what pretty much what I would expect I think."
"Yeah, I think unfortunately we have, yeah. I think often, you know, people will, for example, go into the hospital with a COPD exacerbation and have an MI while they're in there or take a long time to recover and find they've had some sort of cerebral event or something like that as well. So, yes, it's certainly something that's familiar."
"Mmm. Yeah. I mean, it highlights the importance of the condition certainly. So, yes, it's useful to have that spelt out like that really."
"Hmm, I'm not sure to be honest, maybe immobility, blood clots forming in that sort of time. Yeah. That's the only real explanation I can think of to be honest with you."
"I suppose it reiterates that it is a significant condition affecting the whole patient, not just the isolated organ of the lungs, it has far reaching effects in other parts. So, you know, it's not something that I was unaware of, but perhaps good to have that emphasized and shown."
"Okay. So this is what you were mentioning earlier on about better control of COPD and having an effect on morbidity and mortality. So, yeah, that's a good reduction in mortality with this new product. Yeah."
"I think that's good. I mean, because LABA/LAMA is quite a sort of, it's not a placebo, so it's a definitely effective treatment for COPD. So to have a good reduction, a statistically significant reduction against that is compelling I think. Yeah."
"No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think it shows that the control of the illness and the better treatment is beneficial in lots of other ways other than just involving the lungs. So, yeah, no great surprise or anything."
"I guess the obvious answer is that they have an additive effect the three agents. So, you're giving two, giving three is better than giving two. So that sort of would be the obvious way of looking at it."
"Yeah, I mean, I think, as we've already said, it's highlighting that because of the important correlation between COPD and let's say cardiovascular disease and the two-way relationship there, that's improving the control and treatment of the COPD, will have beneficial effects beyond that specific condition. So, it makes you look at it in a broader way I think."
"I mean it's quite high, but you know, I think it's still a significant benefit."
"Okay. Yeah. I mean, again, it's much the same, I guess the same message, isn't it, as the other one. The cardiovascular certainly seems to be the most prominent other major factor. So as it says in the heading there. Yeah, so that's more detailed, but similar message to the last one said, I think."
"I mean, it seems to say that there's more strokes with Product X, which is interesting and more major events with Product X compared to ICS and LABA. So it's perhaps showing slightly in a less favorable light compared to the previous graph in terms of comparison with ICS and LABA because on the chart on the right there's not a huge difference between the two, and on this chart on the left, it seems that there is almost favorable in ICS/LABA rather than the net product X, but they are much the same I think"
"Yeah, similar to the one on the left. I think it's showing quite a big difference between the Product X and the LABA/LAMA, but not such a difference with the ICS/LABA. So the ICS/LABA is closer to Product X than I thought."
"I don't know. That's quite odd. Can't think of an obvious scientific explanation for that, to be honest with you. No."
"I mean, I think not fundamentally differently to how I thought before we had this conversation, in that using three agents is better than using two, better control of COPD is advantageous in terms of other morbidity and mortality. So that's all been sort of confirmed. These details are perhaps not quite as clear cut as you might like them to be, but it still doesn't alter the overall perception, I don't think."
"Yeah. I mean, it seems from the previous chart that there's a big difference you can say between the Product X and the LABA/LAMA. So that's not surprising, but there's a significant reduction in cardiovascular deaths and that's obviously what the previous chart was indicating, so."
"Yeah, I mean, not massively to be honest. I mean, I think probably if I'm honest, all cause mortality."
"Yeah. All cause mortality is probably more important than isolating cardiovascular mortality in general, in our practice, in terms of trying to do our best for our patients. It doesn't really matter why they're dying. We just don't want them to die. So all cause mortality probably is the main thing that we would focus on I think."
"Yeah. I mean, it's good. It's positive and again, like I said earlier on, while it is not a surprise, it's nice to sort of have it confirmed and to see some figures and some charts that bears out and to maybe make us focus a bit more on improving COPD control for other reasons than just COPD control, you know what I mean?"
"I lost you there a second, sorry, the line went a bit funny."
"Yeah. I mean, this is the sort of thing which sort of solidifies it in my mind I think, that belief that I have is correct. And this is the extent to which it is correct. So that's quite useful. Yeah."
"Yeah. I mean, that's quite interesting and surprising that you are getting that sort of level of risk reduction when you put it up against those sorts of legendary studies of literally a long time ago, but still things that we often work by, aren't they though, so, yeah."
"Yeah, I think it sort of further emphasizes the benefit of that when you compare it to other interventions that also reduce mortality. So yeah it sort of makes it even more compelling I think, that comparison."
"Yeah. I mean, if you are going to be choosy about it, you choose Product X because it's slightly better than Product Y but they both have good reductions. So, I think there's probably other factors that you might bear in mind when you are choosing an inhaler like that."
"Things like the device, the patient concordance, the actual drugs in there, the cost of course, that comes into it as well, patient choice, those sorts of things."
"My guess is probably something in the trial makeup. I don't imagine, well, I'd be surprised if there was a major difference between the two products in terms of, they have very similar components and devices. So, my guess would be, seems slightly cynical that it's a trial thing rather than a natural product thing."
"Yeah, it does. It does. I mean, as I say, it was more of a sort of, much more of a vague, not vague, much more of a sort of generalized feeling of a correlation between the two. But this has certainly put meat on those bones and shown that not only is there a close connection between morbidity with the two conditions, but mortality as well, and controlling the COPD with a triple therapy product is beneficial with mortality figures to prove that. So, yeah, it has changed my views or my  inaudible 00:53:19  my views, I guess."
"Yeah. I don't see any reason why not. I mean, there's good reasons then isn't it."
"I think, it's indicating that there are benefits to be had by being maybe more aggressive with the treatment, I think aim higher maybe, you know, aim for better control and so on rather than settling for improvement and aim for more improvement that sort of thing."
"No, no, no. I mean, I think it's, yeah, it's maybe using these triple treatments earlier in the patient's disease, trying to monitor them more regular, but that's difficult with the things going on, but having a lower threshold maybe for using these triple treatments and introducing them sooner than we perhaps have been up to now."
"No, I think, you've achieved all that. Well, we've achieved all that. Haven't we? So, yeah, that's good. Interesting."
"Okay. You too. Thanks so much, indeed. Thank you."
Hi everyone. Thank you for joining. We do have the doctor on the line. Your moderator is Dianne. You can now start.
"Hello. Hi. This is all very different, phone and computer."
"100%, although I've been told it's a 60-minute telephone interview. So I've only got 60 minutes allocated by  inaudible 00:02:49  just to clear that up. So I'll have to go at half past seven, so we'll go through... I'm sure we'll get through it all, but just so you know."
"Okay. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I've got the email here saying methodology, 60 minute web assisted telephone interview."
I feel bad getting them into trouble. It's just that I've got three kids here and I've got to go at half seven.
A typical month? I'd probably say about 30 or 40.
"I think it's great. I think it improves compliance, and it's just a lot easier for them to remember just have one device. So yeah, totally up for that."
"Usually if they've not got on with double, then we'll add in a triple rather than adding in a separate one, as it were."
"Yeah. It's just depending on how they respond to each run of the ladder really. But yeah, I would want to start them off on a steroid, see how they go, add in a LABA. And then if they needed something extra, then I would create that triple therapy."
"A lot. I don't know the exact percentage, but we're... A lot of the reviews do trigger a change in inhaler pattern if they've not been used. Or if they're on the old style, then they'll be moved to the triple. So I don't know the exact percentage, but a large proportion."
"COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide. That's very clear. They're talking about the lungs. Obviously the picture in the middle is showing how many people have it, how much problem it causes, and how poorly controlled it is, I think."
"I think for me, it's the lower circle, the one which says ischemic heart disease, stroke, and COPD. So I think that's a really good one to really get that home to you of the position it has in seriousness really."
Up to 40% of patients are readmitted within 90 days after severe exacerbation. That's a high proportion to suggest that it's really badly treated.
"Only the cynic in me suggests that a large proportion of the reason why it's poorly controlled is because a lot of them are still smoking. And that particular element is out of my control, apart from the advice I give. But if someone is continuing to smoke and have COPD, then I'm not going to be able to make a huge difference, whatever I throw at them."
"But I know that they're not talking about smoking on that slide, so that's a little bit unfair of me to put that in but that's my... I suppose that's the concern I have about COPD. However much we try, if they're still smoking it's very difficult to make much difference."
"Yeah.  inaudible 00:10:12  quality. So basically, it depends on the environment around you that will be triggering more likely problems with COPD. And it's more the Western world, but also the low socio-economic status of the Western world."
"Well, no, no. I was just pointing out that the smoking obviously comes on that slide as well."
"Again, I suppose it's the link with low socio-economic status. So the high BMI, but also the Western world really, hypertension. So yeah, it's all linked in really."
"Very relevant, in the sense that it's obviously high prevalence in the north where I work, and obviously in the west. And not that I work in a particularly low socio-economic group, but I know that we've got a lot of patients with COPD."
I've got no reason to doubt it. So I'd say a seven.
"No, this wouldn't make me think differently. It's just confirming what I know. So I would say a two or a three."
"Sorry. No, it's just because the kids are coming in. Sorry, carry on."
" inaudible 00:12:55 ... That a large proportion of people with COPD have a severe or moderate or severe exacerbation. I think for me, it's just saying how poorly controlled it is."
I suppose it's just a downward spiral. Yeah. I can see what they're trying to say.
I don't know those particular studies so I... Can you just give me one second?  inaudible 00:14:12 . (silence)
"Sorry, just getting what child said. Say that again, the chart on the... The numbers on the...?"
"To be honest, that probably means they aren't that bad. That's not to say we don't know them, but they'd probably be along the mild level."
"Well, I know our patient population and they're quite quick to contact me. So if they haven't reported it, it means it hasn't been that bad."
"I think probably the swirly whirly one is probably the most relevant to, and most interesting to me. So for that bit, I'd say six out but I'm not a particularly charty person. So the  inaudible 00:15:36  and uplifting eclipse, I don't like those charts. I'd say two out of seven. And the 50% to 78%, I would probably give it about a four. Quite interesting, but   00:15:46 ..."
"So for me, it doesn't do anything for me."
"I don't like charts. Go on. I'll have a look. So  inaudible 00:16:43 ... Yeah. So to be fair, the first chart means more to me  inaudible 00:16:56 ... So I prefer the left hand chart to the right hand chart."
"It's saying that even if they have a mild exacerbation, it's still going to do damage to their lungs and reduce their lung function. So we need to know about it, basically."
"The one with the lightning flash, below exacerbation."
"Oh, right. Okay. Yeah. Basically, we need to.... Not only are the exacerbations unpleasant, but they do damage to the lungs, so we need to sort them out."
"With the blue lines and the mild, moderate, severe, and very severe?"
"That's, for me, too much information. I wouldn't focus on that."
They're basically saying that the lung function declines in mild to moderate COPD even within exacerbation. It declines quicker after exacerbation.
Yeah. It's important that we know about it.
"I suppose it's important to... And I know nurses do do the COPD reviews and they will ask about exacerbations, but maybe it's more... To be honest, it's probably more to communicate that with the patients so that they understand that the exacerbation isn't just the acute illness. It's also the damage that the acute illness does to their lungs on the chronic condition."
"Six. Well, seven. I'm sure it's very credible"
"Yeah. I'd say high, even though I just said I didn't like charts, actually it's quite useful. So I'm going to say a six."
I think the visual representation of reduced lung function after a recovery from exacerbation.
"So this is more about mortality. So just that exacerbations, you could almost predict death if someone are getting more exacerbations. I spoke to a patient today, had COPD  inaudible 00:19:56 , and then just died."
"And the wife was saying, ""What a surprise."" But actually it's not really a surprise because they have COPD. If you got two moderate exacerbations, you are 8% chance of dying within a year. Very relevant. I'd say a six out of seven."
I'd say it's higher than I would've thought. I would've thought it was about 60% knowing how many people have exacerbations and they seem to hang around for ages. So I'd say it's probably higher than I was expecting.
"Probably I would have thought that was lower than I think. I would probably push that up to about 50%,  inaudible 00:20:48  40%."
"Yeah. I don't like that. Sorry. What was it? But I will look at it. I'll look at it. Probability of surviving?  inaudible 00:21:06 ... I can't even work that out. You've got the  inaudible 00:21:15  number on. To me, I'm not even going to look at it so no."
"Well, assuming that it is correct, I'd say I've got no way of checking it. But yeah, it's credible. I'd say seven."
Just because I'm surprised by the numbers so I... That's why.
"Okay. Yeah. This is very relevant, and I would give it a six out of seven."
"So it's saying basically don't just think about the lungs, think about the heart as well. And I think we're probably quite bad like that. We'll look at the lungs, and we'll just focus on the breathing and try and... So this is just reminding us that it's all linked, which it clearly obviously is but I think we're quite bad at just looking at one disease system and not focusing on the others."
"I think the two times risk of NMI after a COPD exacerbation definitely. That, to me, is that two times increase of NMI."
Which increase? So that would be the 6 to 10 days as opposed to the 1 to five?
"I think I was just looking at that high times two increase risk of MI. But yeah,  inaudible 00:23:13  40% increase of risk of stroke is very important as well."
"Not like, ""Here's another one,"" kind of thing but yes. And a lot of sudden deaths which you think is probably an MI triggering the sudden death, not necessarily the exacerbation itself like the lack of oxygen. So yeah, but I suppose on a death certificate, you'd put exacerbation of COPD. You wouldn't put MI. You don't know until you do a postmortem exactly what killed them."
Yeah. That shows the importance of chronic disease reviews and making sure that we're checking all aspects of their health on their chronic disease reviews.
" inaudible 00:24:47 ... Personally, for me, it's just a little bit busy so I'm... If you're saying as a page and the information, it's probably a little bit too busy for me."
"But I can see what they're... It's very important. It's showing all the different comorbidities, but there's just a little bit too much information scattered around there."
"I think I'd probably try and make the comorbidity disease a little bit clearer. So rather than having a  inaudible 00:25:37 , maybe just say diabetes, or ischemic heart disease. Just have ischemic heart disease. It's like lots of duplication."
"Yeah, I think so. I think. It's like heart failure icon, ischemic heart disease icon, very similar that just don't really tell me... So I think I'd prefer the words, to be honest."
It's quite a big range. So like the 40% to 140% is quite a big range. I think I'd rather an average amount rather than that big range.
"Yeah. To me, that's quite obvious  inaudible 00:27:05  with the people that have these conditions. It's not teaching me anything I don't know,  inaudible 00:27:11 ."
"Well, it is relevant so I'm going to give it a seven, but it's just I don't particularly the slide."
That people with COPD and cardiovascular disease are going to die of cardiovascular disease.
It is. We've already discussed about it being increased risk of cardiovascular disease in people with COPD. So it's just repeating what we've already discussed. It's been using different studies to back it up really. So it's not really giving me anything that you haven't already said.
I assume that the severe COPD is going to kill them rather than the cardiovascular disease. So not particularly surprised about that.
Credibility is I'm going to believe everything here because I can't   00:29:24  check it.
" inaudible 00:29:46 . Can't even see what that is. So there's a cigarette, and then what's in the other...? Is that pollution?"
"Okay. So that's not particularly clear. I wouldn't know that by looking at it.  inaudible 00:30:17 ... It's a complicated side. But I think what they're saying is that if you smoke and live in a polluted area and you have either a COPD, you're going to have an exacerbation, which then feeds into your risk of having a cardiac event or death. So basically the same risk factors for COPD and cardiovascular disease make a perfect storm, as it were."
"No. So what they're doing is explaining why you're more likely to have a cardiovascular... I suppose, for me, the key box there is the hyperinflation, hypoxemia and the tachycardia. That's the interesting box there for me."
"Again, a seven. Yeah. I think it explains the link rather than just you think, ""Oh yeah, it must be linked."" But this actually explains it."
"I suppose it's giving me a bit of direction about possibly checking the eosinophil count as a marker of risk of exacerbation. For me, that's the interesting bit there."
Yeah. I suppose it's repeated from what we've already been talking about.
"No. No. No. If I did do a full blood count, I would obviously see this eosinophil count, but I wouldn't be routinely doing that on a review or anything."
"No, I wouldn't say it's particularly relevant. I'm going to give it a five because I can't see that we're starting to do routine eosinophil counts on patients, but it is interesting personally."
"Well, it might if I now do a full account on someone and they've got a raised eosinophil. I might be thinking, are they on a steroid? What are they taking for their COPD?"
" inaudible 00:34:07 , further increasing the risk of premature mortality. Okay. So this is like getting there early, before they've had their first exacerbation. So this is telling me that once they've had one, you're on a bit of a slippery slope. So you need to get in there early, and this would be the good one to show people who smoke."
"Yeah. No, I don't like that charty one at all. No."
"It would be better for me, yeah. Just simplified charts are much better. If pages have lots of noise on, I tend to not focus. So I just need simple, simple messages."
I think it's important. Yeah. I think it's a seven. I think it gives gravitas to those early conversations.
"Oh, let's see. Eosinophil count again, isn't it?"
"The risk of the exacerbation increased with elevated bladder eosinophil levels in patients not treated with an ICS. Later exacerbation increase in patients with higher...  inaudible 00:36:16  not increase in patients...  inaudible 00:36:18  does not increase in patients treated, regardless of... I don't really understand what it's saying here, so sorry."
"I think it needs to be relevant to my practice. So to say, ""If you do this, it'll be useful for this reason."" It's complicated. And the fact that I can't grasp it means that it's not making sense. So if you check the eosinophil level, it is raised. This is what you should be thinking. You see what I mean?"
Treatment  inaudible 00:38:12 ... (silence)
"Early identification, optum management and followup. I don't know whether we'd be phenotyping in general practice, but who knows in the future? So that particularly, that's not something that we do. Smoking cessation, pulmonary rehab and pharmacological treatment is everything that we do in general practice. Yeah. It's very relevant."
"Reduction in moderate... So I think what they're saying is if you use triple therapy, you'll reduce moderate, severe exacerbations compared to double therapy. So it's basically saying get them on triple therapy early. Yeah."
"I think that's what we're trying to do. So it goes back to what we're trying to do in clinic, but I think we're still probably on the wrong ladder. But maybe we need to jump quicker to triple therapy."
"Well, then like start with the bronchodilator, then add in the steroid, then add in the  inaudible 00:40:04 , and then you go to triple therapy. But maybe what we should be doing is getting in early with the triple therapy as almost like a first line."
"Seven, because I'll be going early with the triple."
"Diagnose and get in control early because if you don't, you're going to knacker your lungs. And soon as you've had one exacerbation, you're more likely to have further exacerbations. And every time you have an exacerbation, you're more likely to increase your risk of cardiovascular, and then that's what's going to kill you in the end. Really, really cheerful."
Okay. Don't like that one.  inaudible 00:42:09 ... Yeah. Okay.
More effective in avoiding exacerbations.
"It's very compelling. I know that that triple therapy is good, so it's believable and it's... Yeah. So very compelling."
"Basically, what we talked before was probably that we are not doing a very good job, so we need to change the way that we approach COPD. And I suppose what product text is saying, now this is the alternative way of looking at things."
"  00:44:23 ... Yeah, definitely. What we talked about to begin with, that was definitely the focus of that story."
"I suppose it's given you that it's giving you the kind of solution like, ""This is what may help you when you're feeling like, 'Oh my God, this is so bad. Everyone's going to die.'"" Actually, there's a solution here, this how you need to think about it."
"Well, anyone who has a symptomatic COPD that is at risk of an exacerbation."
"They're people who you're diagnosing with COPD who are symptomatic. And previously, we would have gone through various different inhaler options, but maybe we should just be going straight for the triple therapy, and getting them on the benefits straight away."
"So probably breathlessness, especially if they were still smoking so you still felt like they were high risk. So yeah, breathlessness. And if they'd had an exacerbation."
"Yeah. A severe exacerbation. Not severe, but one that's needed treatment at the GP."
"I think there were two about exacerbation and lung function. I did like that. What was the next one? No, I would keep the one before."
"I'd keep that one, and I'd keep the next one."
"G? No, I wouldn't keep that one. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes."
"I think I would summarize that we have to relearn what we... Relearn how we look at COPD and to refresh ourselves and look at it in a different way, reminding ourselves it's not... There's all the different things that we can do to reduce exacerbations, reduce risk factors, and to get out of that stuck-in-the-way thinking that we have on COPD."
"And I think trying to share that with the patient of how... They're used to that. ""Oh yeah, he's got a smoking disease,""  inaudible 00:49:56  but actually just explain the seriousness of the condition and the complexities of it."
"But hopefully in quite a simple way that it's not just, ""You're just going to feel a bit breathless."" All the different things that can happen from having your COPD. So that's a complex reply. But I think, for me, it's let's think differently. Let's approach this in a different way."
I think the charts really linking the cardiovascular disease. That was really good. And the chart that showed the that each exacerbation you have puts you damages your lungs more.
"I think it's just the way it showed how it linked rather than just saying, ""Yeah. Yeah. It links."" It showed what's happening in the body to make them linked."
"Sorry. I can't remember what I said now. No, sorry. It's gone. Oh, the risk. The risk. If you have one exacerbation, you're more likely to have... It's going to damage your lungs each time."
"Well, again, I think I'm just thinking when I'm sitting in my surgery and someone comes in with an exacerbation and you're just treating... You're treating them. And each time you're saying, ""You really need to give up smoking,"" they just look at you like, ""Yeah, whatever."" But actually saying, ""Look, every time you have this problem, it's just... You're doing more and more..."""
It just gives me a bit more oomph to give that message really.
I think maybe some guidance of when they would say introduce it.
"Yeah, product X. If they're saying literally, you're sitting in front of a patient and you're telling them they've got COPD. Are you saying that this is when we should be thinking about product X? Is it first line? Do we get in there early?"
"Because I think that if those are the guidelines, then that's... We're very good at following guidelines. We need to know exactly when to bring it in. So I think just the clarity of where they see it placed in introducing that as a treatment."
Yeah. So it would have to be NICE guidelines coming in because that's what...
"What do you mean, what they would need? Sorry, I don't understand."
"I would be looking for success, like comparison data that these... If someone is on product X early, then they do much, much better. And don't have exacerbations, this, that, and the other. And save the Health Service money on admissions and things like that."
"Well, that's what I'm saying. If that is the best thing to do, and that's what NICE decides, then that's the clarity that we need in... Because we're the ones seeing them at that stage. Because it tends to be when it's more out of control that you start moving to the different ones. But I'm not saying that this is what we should be doing, but if it is, then we need to know."
Exactly. Yeah. Let's get in there early. These are the signs that you need to look for when you need to start thinking about product X.
"We did it. Well, thank you for squeezing it in to the time I'd allocated."
"No, I appreciate your skills in cutting it to size. So apologies that I only had 60 minutes. That's great. Thank you. Thank you, and good luck with all the work."
"Hello, and thank you. We now have the doctor on the line. Your moderator for today's interview is Diane. Diane, go ahead, please."
"Yeah. So,  inaudible 00:03:17  a little bit unusual because I'm a respiratory physician, but I'm also an intensive care doctor. So within my respiratory role, I run a very general respiratory clinic, so I see lots of patients with COPD and asthma, all sorts of respiratory illnesses, really. And then the other specialty I have within medicine is pleural disease. And then I work in a very busy, intensive care unit. So I see lots of patients with respiratory disease, septicemia, postsurgical patients, really quite a mixture of patients who are-   00:03:55 "
"So between all of my practices, quite a lot, really. I would say very month to month, but up to 80 patients a month, 8 0."
So I would say probably about 60% of the patients that I see.
"The majority. So what, percentage of the 60%? Or? So the majority on fixed combination, so I would say of the 60% sort of, probably about 80% of those are on fixed."
"When the patients remain symptomatic on, sort of dual therapy and when they're beginning to exacerbate."
"So, yeah, so it would usually be, sort of three or more exacerbations per year. Or say one severe exacerbation per annum."
"Yeah, so I suppose the first job really is to try as much as possible comes to a firm diagnosis. So I suppose I would see the patients in my outpatients clinic, and clearly everything's a bit different now post Covid. Usually I would have seen them face to face. That doesn't always happen now. So it would be under normal circumstances, apply for medical history, then an examination of the patient. And then I'd kind of start with the basics. So blood tests, chest x-ray, simple spirometry, and then the rest of the investigations would already be guided by what I think the diagnosis to be."
"So, are we talking about COPD patients? Or just any patients?"
"So again, partly guided by what I think their cause might be. So we'd check a full blood count. We might particularly look to see if the patients have is an  inaudible 00:06:58  affiliate or any evidence of allergy. We do some basic biochemical screens and then the rest of it would be a bit bespoke to the patient. So for example, if it's a patient who looks to have potential interstitial lung disease, then we might do immunology screens, rheumatoid factors. If it's a patient who looks like they've got COPD, we might  inaudible 00:07:21  bloods to look for deficiency. So those are the kind of main blood tests that I would do."
"So again, it depends on what I think the history is leading towards. So if I see someone in front of me, I think actually, yeah, their breathlessness is not respiratory based. If they've got cardiac failure, then I might go straight to an echocardiogram. If I think it's probably respiratory, then I'll go through the kind of respiratory set of investigations. And if I'm none the wiser then I'll go down the cardiac route. But it really depends the initial history and examination the patient willing."
"So I guess it depends on what cardiovascular disease they have. So it could be that they've got heart disease, angina, they could have cardiac failure, they could have a say, atrial fibrillation. So to be honest, it depends on how severe they are. So we're quite constrained, unfortunately, by rules and regulations in the NHS at the minute. So if I think the patient needs, say cardiology involvement, I'd probably have to refer back to the GP and ask the GP specifically to refer to whichever cardiac service I think is relevant."
"So if I'm fairly convinced about the diagnosis of COPD- so it depends. So, if the patient- if the history fits, the x-ray fits, the simple spirometry fits, then it depends on what treatment the patient's on. So  inaudible 00:09:09  would be the next step. We'll go through the kind of standard algorithm of treatment depending on the patient's symptoms. And then look at the normal pharmaceutical treatment, I suppose. So smoking position's clearly very important. Consider whether the patient needs pulmonary rehabilitation. Consider whether the patient might need oxygen assessment, those sort of things. And then we have a community COPD service. So, and also to consider whether that might be relevant for the patient."
"So cardiac disease, for sure. So usually it's  inaudible 00:10:15  sometimes cardiac failure, diabetes is quite common. Anxiety, depression are quite common. Hypertension. I think those are the main comorbidities."
"Probably cardiac disease, probably cardiac failure, because it  inaudible 00:10:43  highest mortality mobility. And it's a little bit more  inaudible 00:10:49 so say for example, the patient's got ischemic heart disease, then there might be something, more treatable. So I think cardiac is the most concerning."
"I think I'd probably say the most obvious one, which is unfortunately, quite lot of our COPD patients end up having lung cancer. So that's probably the most concerning and it does happen  inaudible 00:11:11 ."
"So, none of them really. We don't have that kind of resource within our respiratory clinics to do that. So it would be back to primary care and other secondary care services, but via the GP."
"So, if you consider that- cause obviously it's going to have a kind of fairly major impact on every aspect of the patient's care. So we might be more breathless around, might be able to make less of an impact on the breath because of their comorbid condition. Obviously there can be things like drug interactions and what I prescribe might have problems with drug interactions depending what else the patient is taking. And I guess I don't  inaudible 00:12:35  in terms of expectations, in terms of just how efficiently we'll be able to treat the patient."
"Again, probably the majority. So something more like 85%, because by the nature of the disease, they're either smokers or ex smokers. So that's obvious a major risk. And I do work in a fairly deprived area so there are all the other risks that go hand and hand with the deprivation."
"Think about, yes. Routinely monitor, not so much. So, it can seem like every time the patient comes to clinic, if it's a face to face appointment, now we might do some routine obs and check blood pressure and blood pressure control. But that's probably the limit of what we would do in a respiratory clinic."
"Reasonably confident, but it's just, I guess the major issue is kind of resources. I guess what I would say, the services are in a way, as we described, you're a bit departmentalized in a way, perhaps not as holistic as it could be. But I think that's the nature of medicine at the minute. It's become quite sub-specialized. And then there's a real pressure to discharge back to primary care after we've kind of made the diagnosis, decided on appropriate treatment. So it's more, I would say at the minute, more the remit of primary care, that kind of holistic treatment."
"Sure. Yeah. And if someone comes to clinic and they've clearly got  inaudible 00:15:01  heart failure or they're in pulmonary edema that then the cardiac disease becomes more important. Or if they've got unstable angina, that sometimes happens, I know I can recall seeing patients who've come to clinic for a kind of respiratory follow up and they're clearly having an MI in front of you. So then clearly that's not questionable. The cardiac takes priority."
"So it probably doesn't make a huge difference in what, what treatments I choose, but they'll be in the back of my mind. So if I'm try trying to ascertain how much of it is respiratory and how much does it is cardiac. Sometimes it's impossible trying to tease them part. But also an appreciation that when they're so comorbid, they've clearly got a higher mortality. So there's more at stake if that makes sense."
"I think it just makes you think a bit more carefully or if I'm not sure about some of the cardiac diseases- drugs, rather. Because they change and it's not, it's difficult to keep abreast with all the new cardiac drugs so. It might just make me a little bit more cautious or I'll be checking through online  inaudible 00:16:41  and things just to make sure that there's no interactions."
"Yeah, I think that's probably more likely and again, it's just the concern that we know every time a patient with COPD has a severe exacerbation, that it's a kind of a downward trend and I guess the kind of cardiac disease just compounds that really. So it's, yeah, I think it's likely to be more aggressive and proactive really."
"So I think risk is just generally higher. And when I say risk, it's more to do with kind of mortality really because they have less physiological reserve. For example, if someone's got really  inaudible 00:17:49  heart disease, that's only treated medically then as soon as they have an exacerbation become high hypoxic, that's going to have a knock on effect on the cardiac disease."
"Yeah. I think if the patient's got very obvious uncontrolled cardiac disease, and by that I mean pretty unstable angina, or very obvious decompensated heart failure. Or I suppose the other thing would be very severe valvular heart disease. Or I suppose being a bit more esoteric, someone who's got pulmonary hypertension, but we don't think it's the kind of extent, or the COPD doesn't explain the severity of the pulmonary hypertension."
"So, unfortunately, because of the way that NHS is structured at the minute there's not much collaboration, I guess. So it's- I guess I would be aware that the patient's been treated by a cardiologist and I would have access to all the clinic letters on the online system. So I could see what the cardiologist are doing. And likewise, they could see what I'm doing, but that's probably the extent of it really. So it's not face to face or MDT based. It's just kind of being aware and having access to documentation."
"So they frequently do, and it's generally because the patient is breathless and they don't think it's cardiac."
"Yeah, again, it depends on the scenario. So usually for a while. So usually those patients will be referred from secondary care. So I might see them as a new patient in my clinic. And then if it's obvious the patient's got COPD I'll make the diagnosis and commence some treatment, but if the patient's stable, they'll quite quickly get discharged back to primary care."
"So by connection, there's clearly some physiological overlap. So they're both kind of inflammatory processes, if that makes sense. And usually the precipitant of a noxious substance, is usually tobacco based. So similar etiological, similar physiological mechanisms, I guess."
"Cardiovascular is the kind of common physiology. So if the patients more physiologically stressed by the COPD. So for example, tachycardic or more hypoxic then that's not going to be good for the cardiovascular disease. And I guess there's probably something to do with inflammatory cascade. So, so if you've only got COPD and it's triggered a kind of inflammatory process, then that's going to have a knock on effect on the cardiovascular disease."
"So it could reduce the risk. Certainly having a well managed COPD patient could certainly reduce their cardiac risk. It won't negate it completely, but it could reduce it in part."
"So, I suppose similarly, not necessarily evidence based, but I think COPD can probably have more of an effect on cardiovascular disease if I'm honest. But the other way around. Yeah. Similar mechanisms, I guess. I think for me, in terms of symptomatology, the major difficulty is sometimes picking apart, which is actually causing the majority of the symptoms."
"So I guess it's the more severe end of the spectrum. So it's patients who are constantly exacerbating, or maybe having an admission. I guess, a COPD patient that springs to mind is the kind of, patient who seems to have a lot of systemic disease. So whatever that disease process is their COPD is more inflammatory. So it's like a really thin breathless patient. Who's just melting away the muscle because of the kind of continuing physiological stress or advanced cascade of the COPD."
"I suppose the ones that spring to mind, again, like I described are the patients who've got either really decompensated cardiac failure, or really severe underlying ischemic heart disease."
"So I guess it's kind of multifactorial. So again, it can be an inflammatory process. I guess the other thing is it's just a general deconditioning. So if they have severe cardiovascular disease, they're not mobile, they're losing muscle from not being able to exercise. And that kind of has a knock on effect and sort of produces a bit of a vicious, downward spiral."
"I guess it's just that sometimes the reporting is incorrect. So many of the diseases that are being attributed to COPD are in fact, related to some of the other comorbidities. Though, I think cancer was kind of alluded to, but cardiac disease as well."
"I'm not surprised by it, I guess, without going back to the study, I can't remember how they ascertained that in terms of  inaudible 00:26:00  death, I presume it's post mortem data. Again, that's quite difficult, because to me, pathology's not always a very exact science either. But it doesn't come as a huge surprise to me. And also sometimes it's an issue with the process of best certification, if that makes sense."
"So it's just, it's kind of you believe, but it's  inaudible 00:26:23  and it's not particularly surprising."
"So, I'm just currently looking at the study at the minute. So I guess then, the first thing that strikes me is across the study, that it's an average figure 39%. But it's quite a, I guess,  inaudible 00:26:58  16 to 39%. So it's not entirely across the studies, but it's interesting."
"I guess it  inaudible 00:27:17  for a respiratory physician commission to be a little bit more aware of cardiac causes. And although we might not necessarily have the resource to optimize them, I guess it's just have a bit more consideration if we feel that cardiac could be contributing to the patient's overall symptoms. And to have a bit more ownership in making sure that someone optimizes the cardiac treatment."
"Yeah, I think it just the percentage  inaudible 00:28:27  I'm just struggling to get my head round it, but yeah. I kind of think I understand it. So clearly if you've got cardiac disease versus cardiac disease and COPD alone, then your mortality is much increased. It's my kind of, major take home message from it."
"Yeah. I mean, again, it doesn't surprise me because that's my kind of clinical experience if you like. So if you've got COPD and fairly end stage or earlier then, you know the mortality's going to be very high with someone with unstable angina."
"Yeah, I guess, so not surprised at the difference because I think that's what I kind of said my general perception would be. Surprised by the disparity in the figures. So, potentially versus COPD alone, it's threefold versus cardiovascular. Which, that does surprised me. Such a significant-"
"Not differently, but again, it's just a kind of- I think it's something that I have a clinical understanding of. I probably see it in my practice all the time. But again, it's just, I suppose it's A and awareness and B a bit more of an interest in terms of how- ideas to modify risk."
"So again, not surprised because I think it was what we partly discussed in terms of that whole inflammatory cascade that's going on when patients are having a severe exacerbation. So not surprised that, I guess, seeing the figures in black and white, they're kind of, the figures are higher than I expected. So, am I doubling within five days of the exacerbation. So really significant. And similarly the  inaudible 00:31:24  risk it's usually higher within the first 10 days. Not, the facts are not a surprise but the figures are bit of a wake-up."
I suppose it depends on how they've defined moderate.
"Yeah. Again, it depends a bit on the severity. Because you know, people will come  inaudible 00:32:06  on those for exacerbations and, but yeah. But I'm surprised the figures are so high and moderate as compared to severe."
"I suppose it's just slightly different  physiologies 00:32:41 , if that makes sense. And just differences in the cardiac and the terrible circulation. So I'm not sure I can articulate it now, but it's probably physiologically plausible."
"I mean, again, not so much because I think everyone  inaudible 00:33:07  respiratory conditions acknowledges that exacerbations are very bad for patients and what our primary goal is to kind of reduce or stop exacerbations. So again, it's kind of sobering is the word, I suppose, to see the figures in back and white, but it kind of, it doesn't change our goals. If you, like."
"So I'm not sure if I represent them all, because my practice is quite different, but I'd say we're more focused on the respiratory system than the cardiovascular."
"So, just that product X, which is a fixed triple combination, clearly really significantly reducing mortality  inaudible 00:34:38  and dual LABA/LAMA treatment."
"So I think it's  inaudible 00:34:47  I've probably seen before, to be honest."
"Well, figures around those, let's say. Figures around that level. So it's not a surprise, I've kind of seen it before. And it's important. I mean, in terms of figures, it is a huge figure. So it is important data."
"Yeah. I know it's a bit tricky isn't it. You kind of, physiologically, you assume that it's really the addition of the steroids. So it's bit tricky. I honestly don't know the answer. I wonder if some of it might be in compliance."
"So in terms of medical studies, it's quite high. But then, composed of the gain and reduction of mortality than it's still significant. So it's a high number of needed to treat compared to other sort of medical trials, but I guess don't have such significant effects on mortality probably."
"So again, it's interesting to see the figures, but it probably doesn't make me think differently because, it's kind of, that's my practice anyway."
"Yeah. I'm just trying to, digest it. Okay I think I get it. So I guess, the reduction in mortality in the product X is largely due to reduction in cardiovascular death if I'm interpreting it properly. Yeah."
"So I think it's basically the reduction of mortality of the product X, which is a triple product is said to be more attributable to the reduction of cardiovascular events."
"Sorry. The first one on the left, so it confirms- so it's some of the terminology, so confirmed major cardiac- cardiac- major adverse cardiac event. Okay."
So I'm struggling with this a little bit. So its percentage of patients having cardiovascular events and then... so non-fatal MI seem to be a significant thing. Yeah. And also it looks to me like it's mostly from the  inaudible 00:39:52  heart disease and MI as opposed to  inaudible 00:39:58  I think that's what I interpret from it.
"So a little bit surprised if I'm honest. So I guess it begs the question in terms of what is making the difference, in terms of physiological possibility. It's a little bit difficult to  inaudible 00:40:41 "
"So my clinical assumption would be that we're interlinked with respiratory, if I'm really honest, but that's not what the data appears to show. So I don't know if it's a reduction in an inflammatory process. But that would be my best guess."
"So yeah, I mean, it is meaningful and compelling. It's just how credible it really is in a kind of, clinical outward trial format. But you can't argue that it's meaningful."
"Again, in terms of my clinical practice, I'm not really sure that it would necessarily change because it's still what I do. It's not really going to make me prescribe a triple therapy differently. I suppose there's a natural  inaudible 00:42:09  I suppose the argument is to do it a little bit earlier, but it's, I guess that treatment pathway's not clear yet because. We're not in the habit of, kind of, really taking people's cardiovascular risk. So I suppose in time it might change. Practice might need more, what's the word, either joint care or maybe respiratory physicians will pay more attention to cardiovascular risk and that might in time lead to, sort of more preemptive treatment. But I think we're a bit away from that at the minute, but I guess that's maybe what the data's leading towards."
"It is, isn't it. Because I suppose there's a respiratory position, naturally the assumption would be that a lot of the reduction in mortality is due to primarily respiratory causes. So it just, it adds that bit of kind of interest, curiosity as to why it's so much bias by cardiovascular there."
"So, it's possible, I mean, we've seen it in other walks of medicine, if you like, for example, statins might be the best example of that. So yeah, it's plausible it's just, I guess a naturally cynical position. It's just wanting to see more of the data, peer reviewed, picked part, to see what kind of, clinicians in the real world would make of it."
"Yeah. So just a little bit more detail. I think so because of Covid, I've not had a lot of time spend on, on evidence and trials. So I think for me, I go back to the trials and look at them and see like I said, sometimes pathology's not an exact science, so I'd want to go back and look at how they ascertain that. Is it post mortem based? Is it  inaudible 00:44:47  to practice in the United Kingdom? And just that the patients that they've looked at are kind of roughly the kind of patient groups that I'd see and treat."
"Okay. It's just, I think it's just trying to make a point that the mortality benefits for triple product to  inaudible 00:45:27  with some of the lung mark cardiovascular trials. So we mentioned statins.  inaudible 00:45:31  So it's important data because it's certainly sit up and pay attention. For me, it goes back to kind of trying to pick apart the why and the sort of subtleties of, and just what experts might think about the biological plausibility of it having such a significant effect. And I guess as a clinician, you can see why a nation has  inaudible 00:46:06  mortality with cardiovascular disease or an SGLT or a statin, but it's a bit more difficult to get your head around the kind of biological possibility of why a triple product will do it."
"Yeah, of course. If you believe and buy into the data, then you'd be much more inclined to-"
Yeah. So on the face it would definitely make an impact. So it would definitely make you more inclined to prescribe product X for sure. But that really based on what you've got in the trials and the biological possibility and the peer review of all the trials enter.
"So I guess it just brings it more to fore. If I'm really honest, and I know it sounds a bit strange, but mortality is not always your kind of key goal in treating respiratory patients, because sometimes it's purely about other things, so it's the quality of life symptoms for them. It's only one of the factors, but clearly it's an important factor."
"I suppose it doesn't change it because it's clearly quite commonly recognized that there is a link, but I suppose it might just make me think about it a bit more. In terms of paying more attention to the patients I have, who've got kind of dual pathology. As I say, maybe thinking about things bit more preemptive. And then it does make me think and look and try and kind of understand what the kind of biological mechanisms for the effect might be."
"Yeah. Yeah. It's certainly one of the reasons. As I say, it's not the only reason, but it is certainly one of the reasons."
"So it's kind of based on patient  inaudible 00:49:35 . So like we said to improve on quality of life and improving patient symptoms, keeping that hospital. So those are the other, kind of more acknowledged goals. If you like."
I think it's become more plausible as more evidence gathers on the benefits. I think some of the concerns looking like- that we've had in the past with respiratory conditions. So particularly the kind of links of pneumonia and sepsis don't seem to be  inaudible 00:50:24  and the kind of  inaudible 00:50:24  larger study. So I think there's going to be sort of less  inaudible 00:50:29  if you like and more evidence to do it. So I think it will happen.
"So the mortality data seems to be there. So I guess it's things like a reduction, improvement in symptoms, maybe reduction in lung function decline, more of that kind of reduction in exacerbation, severity of exacerbations, frequency of exacerbation."
"I, no, I don't think so. I think we talked quite a lot about all the issues with it, so yeah, no, I don't think I've got anything to add at this stage."
"Okay. Likewise, thank you. Take care. Bye bye."
"We now have the doctor in the line. Angelina, you may go ahead."
"Yeah. Okay. That's fine. So, I'm in a semi rural area. We look after about 8,000 patients. It's the second highest elderly population in our local region. There's a very strong elderly element to the population. Fortunately, we live in an area where actually the depravation is actually very, very low. I think we've got two total suites of depravation, that's pretty much about it. And we have a lot of elderly, well people living well into their 80s and 90s."
"Yeah. Yeah. So we have a dedicated COPD clinic where we have a COPD nurse and all the doctors are involved in and over the last, I guess, probably 10 years or so, we've been actually very proactive in trying to pick up COPD by identifying the chronic smokers by identifying the people with chronic coughs and actually getting them assessed appropriately and picking up as many as we can."
"Yeah, absolutely. So again, treatment depends on how symptomatic the patients are and how many times they've ended up going into hospital. So I think the huge change in the last three or four years has been the change from previous guidelines of using steroids and LABAs to using the Gold Guidelines now, and actually assessing them based on their symptoms and their ability to work. And actually moving away from having steroid inhalers as the first line treatment and going down the road of LAMAs and LABAs is much, much more than ever."
"So I think a lot of the older patients who have been previously diagnosed over the years have probably built up to, I think traditionally we had some elderly GPs who were on the verge of retirement, who used to put everybody that was diagnosed with COPD onto serotide and spiriva as their standard treatment for almost everybody. And obviously a lot of them have survived in a similar way. And some depending on their needs, depending on their desires or depending on how  inaudible 00:06:32  their hands were and how happy they were using various inhalers, have either been moved now to the available triple therapies and a number have remained just pretty much as they were. Some have now been changed to slightly more modern... The more Gold Guidelines where you're treating... Of using a LABA. But I think as with all these things it is really about in individualized treatment."
"The treatment that works is the one that the patient is happy to have that you negotiate with them, rather than you saying, as a clinician, this is what we need to do and this is what we're going to do and them saying, ""Well, I don't want to do that."""
"Six dose triple therapy. Now of the hundred, I would probably assume eight of them would be on a six dose, triple therapy."
"So, over the last 18 months, we haven't actually seen any significant number of drug reps. We do get the odd thing in on email regarding inhalers and very occasionally there'll be somebody presenting online again before or after, before a meeting, just to update us on things. But the number of meetings in the last 18 months have been absolutely minimal. What do we like to see? Most of us we're scientists and everything, so we like to see evidence. We like to see evidence based for treatment. And ideally for things like inhalers, we like to see comparisons which compare like for like."
"So if you're comparing triple therapy, you're comparing triple therapy against triple therapy, rather than triple therapy against something single or a dual therapy even. Because that gives you that really tells you why it's much better to use and gives you the confidence and the confidence you use it in your patients as you see them."
"Yeah. So we're still talking about COPD obviously, aren't we? Yeah. Not generally, we're talking about COPD?"
"Yeah. So for COPD, what I'd like to see is how much does this inhaler improve quality of life in terms of the symptoms and how much does it reduce hospital admissions compared a standard or a previously used in the molecule or inhaler."
"I think this is quite a good slide. I think the two things that stand out and probably again, go back to the things I mentioned earlier is that over half of the patients with COPD are undiagnosed and actually the leading cause of death world worldwide. That really does stand out to say one of the importance of the disease and recognition into trying to make sure that you treat them quickly and early and prevent their deterioration."
"Those two are the big ones though. You know, the fact that over half are undiagnosed and it is the third leading cause of death after ischemic heart disease and stroke. I think that leaves a lot of food for thought and just shows how important the disease is to our well... Well in the medical profession as a whole."
"I knew about the under diagnosis which is why as I say we've had a really big push about that. I didn't realize it was a thirdly, I knew it was one of the top, probably top 10. I didn't realize it came that high up on the scale."
"No. Everything on the slide is actually really nice and clear and makes sense. So the 40%, three admitted is quite an interesting set. Second most common cause of emergency admissions. They're quite interesting statistics and they're nice and fair."
It's a seven. It's everything that we need to know and yeah.
"Yeah. It's probably a six. I think if there was... Well, I can see the numbers. But I want to see where the references come from exactly. But yeah, I'll give it a six."
Seven again. Because it shows how prevalent and how important it is.
And the high level of morbidity and mortality.
"Okay. Well, yeah. This is much more busy than the other slide and   00:15:57 ."
"Yeah. So, I think so four places like Europe and America, it's interesting to know what's happening in the rest of the world. I'm not sure it's very relevant unless somebody is practicing across two different continents. I think the environment risk factors is, again it's an interesting thing that most clinicians who are doing this would be aware of anyway. I think the one that probably stands out the most and would probably be relevant if you remove the map and everything else, the bottom right hand side where it says increased likelihood of health rate issues. I think that's probably the big one I would want to see covering the whole chart really. Because again, it just pushes-"
"Health related issues and not the map so much. The map, yes it's interesting. But again, most of us who practice in one area, it's nice to know it's prevalent. But no-one's really going to go digging deep into why is it so bad in China. It's very obvious why it's so bad in China, in India, in Brazil because they're the up and coming developing nations and they are burning their share of fossil fuel and they have their share of polluting cars and everything else that goes with it. So it's not difficult to figure that one out."
"No. So sorry. So as a UK health practitioner, I think that the circle with England showing on the map is actually for me a lot more interesting and I'd be quite interested to know why within England, there's so many regional variations. Is it because of their local industry in the areas where it's high, is it because of the prevalence of more elderly people who are smokers or have been long term smokers. What is the reason for these huge variations."
"Some better than others, but overall, probably a five."
"There's a lot of information on there. I think in terms of relevance, there's not very much new information on here except possibly what's on the bottom right hand side for those clinicians who don't deal with a huge amount of COPD. So increased likelihood of health related issues is the big one that really stands out. The rest of it I think most of us are aware of and it's not new information."
"Yeah. So compared to the previous one, again this is a much more clearer slide and gives us much more useful information along with studies, which always just help back up relevant information. And, so."
"It's telling us COPD is a severe disease and every time the patient ends up in hospital, their quality of life will continue to deteriorate and increases their chance of further mobility and mortality. Which in a roundabout way says pick it up, could and treated properly."
So the significant impact on patients. That loopy drawing where it's showing what happens...
"What happens with each exacerbation on the right, yeah. The one that shows what happens with each exacerbation on the right and taking into count physical, mental and quality of life. I think that's quite a nice picture."
"Yeah, I mean, again, I'd like to think we treat our COPD patients quite well because of the clinical modalities we put on with the respiratory nurse who does follow them up every six to nine months and with the reviews that we do as doctors with them. I'd like to think ours is probably less than that, but I'm not sure how much less. Maybe 50% rather than 77%. But I think overall talking to other doctors and seeing what goes on in hospitals, in my previous life, I think it's probably about right."
"I'm guessing that's not in the UK. Because actually in the UK, with the clinical systems that we use, we highlight every single COPD exacerbation, we recode them so it's picked up nationally in statistics. Then if they're admitted to hospital then in a similar way, it would be reported. So I can't quite figure out how that works in-"
"Yeah. Yeah. Fine. Fair enough. Okay. For most of them who have exacerbated, they either need antibiotics or they need steroids or they need a combination."
It would be unlikely. They'd be able to get it from anywhere unless they actually saw a healthcare professional to do that. So it would form part of their clinical node and if their clinical notes were coded properly then it would form part of a reporting system where it would be very easy to go in and see how many patients have had an exacerbation in the last year and who's had an exacerbation.
No. Otherwise I think it makes good clear sense.
I do. I do like it. I think it tells you a lot of information in very few words.
"Again, everything is referenced. So I'd say it's a good seven as well."
I'm sorry. I missed all of that. It came very blurry through.
"Yeah, I can see it. Perfect. I couldn't hear you very well when you were just speaking."
"Yeah, so again, this is a fairly good slide. And again, I think the take home message is exacerbations are bad and lead to increased morbidity and mortality. So in inadvertently make sure that you pick up your COPDs and they're treated appropriately to prevent that worsening impact of recurrent exacerbation and worsening lung function."
It's not new information because actually most of the work we do is essentially about preventing exacerbations in the COPD. I think it's a well known issue for forever.
"Absolutely. And again, we see it on a regular basis. The ones who come home after spending a week, 10 days in hospital, they're significantly frailer and recovery is long and slow. If they ever get back to any level of what was it, what their baseline was."
"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So again, that's interesting. I guess that this would be new information because obviously, as I said at the beginning, a lot of mild patients who are fairly asymptomatic have or need any particular treatment at all. So they would only come to our attention if there was a worsening, a lung function at their yearly review, which again because of COVID, hasn't been as well as it should have or if they suddenly were admitted or they came to us with an exacerbation."
"Yeah. I think that's probably new information for me. And it probably may makes sense if something I possibly didn't pick up on so much, but yeah. Their loss in lung function is significantly more than those with moderate, severe, or very severe lung disease, isn't it? So that's interesting and well worth taking into account."
"I think so when we see our mild, our patients who are classified as having mild COPD, just taking that bit more interest and maybe spending a bit more time in terms of educating them and reminding of them they should have a low threshold, to seek help if they were to have any symptoms of an exacerbation rather than saying. Yep, you're good. I'll see you in a year."
"No, I think as a two-sided spread, it's actually quite interesting and does make good sense."
"So again, it's reference and well set out so I'll give it a seven."
"Yeah. Motivation again, would be high, it's seven."
"Because again, it tells us what we knew but it puts that into figures and numbers, which I think as a scientist, you all quite like."
"Yeah. So there's some quite profound, depressing figures, but yeah. Okay."
"I think it's the risk of death, isn't it, to moderate exacerbation then dead within one year, it's actually quite... Yeah. And again, it's probably true to form the ones, if you go in one, you struggle if you go in twice, a lot of people don't make it out of hospital after that."
"Yeah. And again, the probability of surviving again, number of exacerbations, it just proves the same point again in a different way. So, the bottom line is you need to try and prevent exacerbations and if there are exacerbations, you need to treat promptly and early."
"So I think the exact numbers are probably new to me or I possibly you them at one point and it's gone, it's become an old memory. Obviously everyone's aware that every exacerbation is bad and increases your risk so I think the numbers are probably a little bit more new, profound and hard-hitting."
"I think it's saying you need to keep an eye on your COPD patients, optimize their treatment, prevent exacerbation, prevent hospital admissions. And that is the longest way of making sure that they do well in life."
"I think it's a reminder again, just to... Just a reminder to look at the patients who you consider to be a low risk COPD or a mild COPD patient and making sure that they're involved in their treatment and aware of long term outcomes."
I'd give it a seven. This is very relevant because it shows me and my staff what we need to be doing.
"Again, seven. It's well referenced. It's got good eye, it's got good research based behind it and it's very clear in terms of numbers."
"Yeah. Seven again. Again, that reminder about treating COPD very, very seriously."
"So I think this is new information. We're used to getting new information in terms of... We're used to getting cardiovascular outcome data in terms of newer medications that are licensed for things like diabetes and stuff. This is the first time I've actually seen the cardiovascular risk of COPD pronounced. It probably makes sense because obviously, the vast majority of these patients have been ex smokers and quite heavy ex smokers or had lots of lung damage from various other reasons. It probably does make sense. I think the numbers would be a new thing and just remembering how much the risk increases of cardiovascular outcomes after COPD exacerbations is quite interesting and new."
"Yeah.That 90% increased risk of CV events for up to a year, suggest to me that when we see them after an acute exacerbation, it really is important that we consider their cardiovascular risk, consider whether we need to do further bloods on them and do a cardiovascular risk profile and ensure their blood pressure's okay and their cholesterol. Just to give them the best chance from that point of view as well."
"No, it's absolutely clear. The numbers are clear. And what the chart is trying to say is quite straightforward for most people."
"At the moment, I've got to admit it doesn't particularly fit in with my clinical practice at the moment. But it would encourage me to change mine and the practices current practice, and then maybe adding in something along the lines of a cardiovascular risk assessment for our COPD patients."
At the moment that would be a four. But I'd like to increase that to seven eventually.
"Because again, unless they have COPD and either hypertension or a TIA previously or a cardiovascular disease, it probably is something that we wouldn't concentrate as much as we like on, whereas in the future, I think it should form part and parcel of all of the reviews for COPD."
"I think the main risk is the multi mobility associated with the COPD. I think similar to the previous side, I think we need to think above and beyond this as just a lung disease and look at the heart disease side of thing, look at the risk of diabetes, look at the risk of a heart failure in all of these people."
"Yeah, again, I probably never diabetes in anything to do with COPD. So I think, again, it's probably worth considering. As I mentioned previously, if they're going to do a cardiovascular risk assessment on these people with COPD, it's not difficult to add on a HbA1c to check for diabetes or to consider whether they are at risk of diabetes and what needs to be done for that side of things."
"No. No, I think because the awareness is there now, I think just having that overall holistic look and review of these patients is probably quite a good idea."
"Hmm. Yeah. So relevance at the moment again, similar to the previous slide would be a four."
"Yeah. I think again, similar to the two slides previously, the cardiovascular side of things, we really do need to take a real further interest in for these people. I think lung cancer, we all understand but looking at the cardiovascular side, the heart disease, the AF all of those things, we need to really take an interest in and possibly even screen for every time we see the COPD patients routinely."
"Yeah. The 39 is a new... it's new information for me. I think the lung cancers, we do regular chest x-rays just to pick those up. But the cardiac related stuff is interesting. For internal most dying from because it's not that they aren't COPD."
"Yeah. Well, isn't what you'd expect it to be, that's for sure. Yeah. It's almost double in moderate COPD. That is COPD."
"Yeah. So again, it needs to be that holistic outlook on looking at lung, heart, diabetes, everything. Trying to decrease all the risk factors that could end up causing cardiovascular type problems in these moderate COPD patients."
"We see a lot of cardiovascular events. I'm not convinced it as much as this, but again because you see individual patients rather than whole groups. You don't put them all together, it may well be but I would say at the more significant in terms of numbers, it would be significantly less than this."
"No. No, it's actually very nice and clear."
"Again, I think most of us, we don't put the whole cardiovascular disease side of things within the COPD clinic that we run. So it's a five I'd like it to be a seven in terms of relevance."
Yep. It would be a seven again. Prevention of COPD and cardiovascular input.
"Yeah, it makes perfect sense. Hyperinflation, hypoxemia and tachycardia as a cause of cardiovascular morbidity after an exacerbation, it makes perfect sense. And that's exactly what you'd expect, I guess. Yeah."
"Scientifically it makes perfect sense, is it new? Yeah, I think tying the two together is probably a new thing, yeah."
Yeah. It does. It does now much more than ever. Yeah.
"Yeah, it just fortifies the need for almost making COPD and cardiovascular clinic and really looking to maximize the risk factors in all our COPD patients, taking into account the cardiovascular risk that are associated with it."
"Yeah, I would say based on this, we really... Other than just doing spirometry and getting them to fill out the questionnaire about impact on life, we need to really discuss with them the other risk factors and consider doing a pulse check and a blood pressure... A pulse check for AF, for blood pressure to see that their blood pressure is normal and considering if they haven't had it already checking their cholesterol as well. Just to give them an all round holistic review."
"Yeah. So I think, again, it's a fairly good slide talking about the need for identifying those at most risk and optimizing their treatment."
"No. No, we don't measure it and we're not aware of it. I think we look at it much more in people with asthma rather than COPD."
Yeah. I think it's interesting. I need to see more information regarding the research and the background to this and whether it would be relevant for us to even consider doing any clinical count on people with COPD.
"So the future risk would be... It will be the... Sorry, the question... Which would be the most-"
"Breathlessness certainly, your eosinophil count no. Breathlessness when you would assess them, you start thinking, do I need to change and escalate their medical treatment really?"
"We would have to order. We'd have to request a full blood count and check the eosinophil count, it wouldn't necessarily be available unless it had to be tested recently for something else completely."
"If they had a full blood count, it wouldn't be because they had COPD. A full blood count would be done for a whole bunch of other symptoms. It wouldn't necessarily be done in every COPD patient every year."
Because at the moment this really isn't relevant. eosinophil counts and things really aren't relevant to the practice.
That's right. Yeah. I don't think there's enough here to tell me to change my practice in any way based on this.
"Yeah. So again, there's not much new information on here. Most of our lives for COPD patients are spent trying to reduce exacerbations and hospital admissions. And as soon as they have exacerbations and hospital admissions, we do try and maximize and optimize their treatment. So it's not new information. But I guess in terms of the numbers, that's interesting"
"No, no. I think that personally, I think that's what I would expect. And there's a nice gradual upward curve. So it goes none, one, two and it goes 25%, 40%, 80%."
"No. Not really. And again, it's probably, in general practice you spend 20, 30, 40 years in the same place. So I think if I looked back on the patients I've been looking after for the last 15 years and it probably is the sequence of events that we see."
Yeah. Seven. I think it banged home the need to look after your COPD patients and completely optimized treatment and prevent exacerbation.
"Yeah. Okay. So yeah. MRC scale is the scale that we now actually use when we're assessing either routinely or when they're exacerbating, the symptoms. Yeah. So MRC, it's a good scale. And obviously again, it makes perfect sense as the scaling gets worse, their risk of hospitalization and exacerbation increases."
"Again, take breathlessness seriously and look at optimizing treatment to prevent further exacerbation."
Probably a six. Because I think we pretty much do this already anyway.
"This is slightly counterproductive to the changes we've made in the last three or four years. So since the Gold guidelines came out, we've gone away from ICSs and this almost is going back the way we're completing this circle again. And again, I'd like to see more about the  inaudible 00:56:12 , more and more data about the eosinophil count."
Yeah. Yeah. I can see their risk is higher. How relevant or how much this would change our clinical practice is probably not a huge amount to be perfectly honest.
"Because again, it's that change in mindset. We would have to literally do eosinophil count on every single COPD patient, review that and then completely change what we've been trying to maybe unchange for the last few years based on it. Unless the evidence was so compelling that it needed to be done for everybody, I think this is going to be quite difficult to put into clinical practice. You could probably do it for the ones who have recently exacerbated or are worsening. But I think as a blanket for everybody, it's unlikely to take shape."
"No. I think the message is loud and clear. I think if there was some evidence or some guidelines to say when this would be appropriate to use and for what type of patient and in what type of setting, that would be much more useful for this slide."
"Relevance to my practice would be three, because it's not something we do at all at the moment. And it's unlikely to change clinical practice in any way."
Yep. Stepwise treatment is absolutely bang on.
"It tells us exactly how we would be using the Gold guidelines for this, if we start with bronchodilators, if they have further exacerbations, you escalate treatment moving forward. So I think, again it marries up with current clinical practice. And then obviously you don't want to delay treatment because there's a risk for the future so you catch them early and treat them optimally."
"Yeah. The critical point is diagnose early and see regularly, especially for exacerbations and make sure you make the appropriate changes early on."
It's saying maybe the stepwise approach could be accelerated in people who aren't doing as well as they should be. So possibly reviewing sooner and considering pushing further sooner.
"So I think again, overall it does fit with what the current clinical practice is. And there is a big push for smoking cessation, pulmonary rehab and pharmacological treatment for all of these things."
"It is an important part and as I said, I think it is pretty much what most COPD clinics and most COPD patients would be getting currently."
No. No. I think it's a good slide because it rounds out everything that hopefully is currently going on in most COPD clinics.
"No, it's a very good slide. It's actually quite clear and it's quite easy to follow."
"Yeah. So I think the key takeaway for me of all of this was we need to optimize management, review our COPD patients sooner. And I think the big take home would be that we need to consider them a little bit more holistically than just the COPD patient by looking at their cardiovascular risk factors and modifying anything that is possible to modify."
"Yeah. So the challenges are always the same, it's the resources to be able to see as many people as possible, the resources to ensure that patients turn up, reducing DNAs and patient motivation in terms of their compliance with their treatment."
Yeah. I think it reiterates everything we're trying to do and probably adds another layer in terms of the holistic overall outcomes.
"Yeah. So again, I mentioned it earlier on. So we're comparing the triple therapy with the dual therapy, which almost immediately in my mind says you're not comparing like for like straight away. I think the numbers overall are good, but it's slightly against going back to what we used to do seven, eight years ago of trying to get everybody onto a triple therapy as soon as possible, rather than having the stepwise Gold guidance approach to treating COPD."
"Yeah, I think we do. I think we do quite honestly."
"Fixed dose, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So again, they would be our sort of most high risk or very likely to be the ones who have had recent exacerbations or are most risk of having serious exacerbation."
"I'm sorry. Just say that one more time, what?"
"Yeah. Again, it would fit in with again the high risk, the repeat exacerbators, the severe end of the spectrum rather than the mild end of the spectrum."
"Unless they're symptomatic, I think we'll be going against the guidelines. Otherwise it would make COPD a brainless exercise of getting everybody irrespective of their severity onto a triple therapy from day one."
"No, again. We're going away from that unless the guidelines change overnight, which I think is highly unlikely, unless if that would've change overnight, I don't think it would."
"I think if guidelines weren't there. I think most people who would moderate, severe COPD should be on a triple therapy."
"Again as I mentioned when we were doing this, there's not much new information here that would change in management. It's something that we're all aware of and we'd all be anywhere."
"Yeah, the cardiovascular risk of COPD exacerbation I thought was really, really hard hitting."
"No. No. I think this covers... I think the rest of them cover everything quite well and the data, as I said, it's a highlighted link and it's linked to the papers and stuff that go with it and that's fine."
"I think the things to push are the product, what type of inhaler it's in and where it sits currently on the guidelines. I think if you can sell it where it sits currently on the guidelines, you'll get a lot of buy-in. If you're trying to break the guidelines and go outside that, it makes it a little bit more difficult for people to want to use it."
"Okay. Well, I'm a general cardiologist. I work with a team of probably about 14 general cardiologists now, who cover a large regional area, which is largely rural, I guess and suburban. We've got a population of about 600,000."
"I have a subspecialty interest in both heart failure and heart rhythm disorders and also implants of cardiac electrical devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators. I also run a pregnancy service for people with heart disease."
"It's probably got to be over a 100, I'd have thought."
"Well, the most common ones will be heart failure, which is really a syndrome. Which is the end stage of whatever their other diseases are. And then they've got coronary artery disease. They've had heart attacks as well, or they have heart rhythm problems. Often atrial fibrillation, but other heart rhythm problems as well, such as supraventricular tachycardia or even ventricular tachycardias."
"And then there also other cardiomyopathy such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy. And then of course there's the very, very common comorbidities that our patients present with that a lot of them have. Conditions such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, airways disease such as COPD, erectile dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, because obviously these all share... Are either risk factors for cardiac disease or share the same etiologies."
"Generally, I guess, there's a big trend in the United Kingdom. We should be moving away as much as possible from referring to each individual specialist. We should be managing as much as we can on our own."
"That's obviously the way training in the United Kingdom's going. The junior doctors who are being trained now are being trained to have that confidence to not sub-refer everything. But on top of that, a lot of our work is in hospital."
"We have a lot of specialists, nurses who are involved on a day-to-day basis. So we work alongside them as well. So if you've got someone with diabetes, it's very useful to let the diabetic specialist nurse know and they'll also come and review that management and come and provide advice and input as well. And on very rare occasions, suggest specialist input, although that's not normally required."
"Yes, I would do a bit, but I'm not sure most cardiologists would. But I've got a degree of confidence to do that. And then on top of that, diabetes is an interesting area because, as you may or may not know, one of the classes of drugs that is being used as a treatment to diabetes to help improve glycemic control has recently been shown to be an independent treatment for heart failure, even in patients who aren't diabetic."
"And it also helps to improve your cardiovascular risk profile. So, the SGLT2 inhibitors now, so we've gained a lot of confidence in using those and have a low threshold for starting those, both as a combination to treat someone's diabetes, but also to modify their CV course as well."
"If I was starting them on an SGLT2, did you say?"
"Our local protocol is such that you're supposed to inform the diabetes specialist nurse. However, I would do if I thought it was appropriate. Obviously if they've got a low EGFR, the SGLT2s not going to particularly affect their glycemic control, so I wouldn't."
"I might try and stop any glycoside or other sulfanuric, just the combination of both increases the risk of hypoglycemia. And so I'm not overly keen on patients being on both if their renal function's good and they're already on insulin. Again, I may look slightly down titrate their insulin dose. So within the realms of my confidence, yes, I'll make some changes."
"No. In patients, you've got significant peripheral vascular disease will also optimize. That will ensure they're on appropriate secondary prevention. If they're not highly with antiplatelets or cholesterol lowering drugs."
And also there's evidence that these patients may well benefit from low dose rivaroxaban and anticoagulants. So we'll consider that management of those patients. They're probably the main comorbidity you actively get involved with.
"So the main test that I'll use... Well, the first thing I'll do is so much is based on the history and examination. And you often can tell from that, if you sit and listen to patients with the correct differentials in the history."
"Beyond that, a chest x-ray and basic bloods. Now, obviously there's a lot on NT-proBMP and that can be a very useful tool for helping differentiate patients who've got heart failure. Have heart failure specialists, I don't need the NT-proBMP and you know, it's really a good tool for people who aren't necessarily as confident clinically to help ensure they're not missing things."
"Now, if there is a condition known as heart failure or preserved ejection fraction, that's much harder to diagnose. Heart failure when the heart's pumping strongly. In those patients, I certainly will be using the NT-proBMP. And again, the other tool that I'll use to help me in our patients, but not necessarily in inpatients, is spirometry. If there's a certain amount of diagnostic doubt."
"I want to say that, of course, the main differentials really of breathlessness that you're thinking about, that's the starting point. Is this due to cardiac disease, which is normally heart failure. It can be a presentation of coronary artery disease, but then the other main respiratory causes will be COPD. Sometimes it's just due to obesity and or the conditioning or even a hypoventilation syndrome. Or they may have interstitial lung disease. They're really the most common differentials that we see for breathlessness."
"Yes, I do. If we're talking about breathlessness. Again, if someone presents acutely to hospital, it's normally obvious to be fair. Just from clinical examination and the chest x-ray because you get signs if it's heart failure, that fluid overloaded, and you can see that. Here's that fluid, feel that fluid clinically and see it on the imaging such as their chest x-ray. In an outpatient setting, it can be much more difficult to tell when someone is stable and then those patients have got a much lower threshold for spirometry and for more imaging as well."
Sorry. Can I have one minute? Is that okay?
"Well, yes, as I said, in all those other differentials that we discussed, particularly the outpatient setting, it will be that sometimes you find no cause and it is just deconditioning. Sometimes obesity is often related to that."
"Then there is COPD is probably the most common one, that we'll see is the other cause of breathlessness. And then there's other such things such as interstitial lung disease, even lung malignancies, I guess. And then the spectrum of other conditions I'm probably less confident at diagnosing."
I would be reasonably confident to diagnose COPD.
"Well, the next steps... Well, I would write back. It would depend. If I thought their COPD was reasonable, I would probably just recommend... If there were on no treatment at all, I'd probably recommend to the GP in the first instance, just to try an inhaled beta agonist."
"I guess if there was a degree of reversibility on the spirometer, I'd also recommended inhaled corticosteroid and then I'd send back to the GP and I wouldn't arrange follow up. If it was someone who already had COPD and it was quite marked then I guess I might... If I didn't think their medication was optimized and my limitations are probably knowing that these patients probably should be on long acting beta two agonist."
"Long acting antimuscarinics. Steroids, inhaled steroids on many cases. And then I would either advise the GP to begin to either dose into like a combination inhaler of all of them. And I might reconsider referring to my colleagues in respiratory, although to be fair, our waits locally for respiratory are a joke. And therefore there's just not much point in referring on to respiratory. So I'd probably, again, just refer back to the GP, knowing the GP can hopefully access the community COPD nurses as well for assistance if they need it."
"Well, in that case, then I would keep them. They'd be staying under my care because I'd be managing their cardiac disease. And at the same time, when I'm seeing them for their cardiac assessment, of course, I'm managing their  inaudible 00:15:05  in total. So if I felt their COPD wasn't maximally treated, then again, I'd make recommendations as I felt appropriate to the GP within my probably narrow knowledge of the disease area."
"The other thing... The other area where where it becomes entirely entwined is a number of patients with COPD develop a condition, pulmonary hypertension. Whereby the pressures in their lungs go up and that causes back pressure on the right side of their heart."
"And that causes right heart failure. And then I end up... I tend to be better than both lung doctors and the GP at managing that. It's a very difficult condition to manage. So I'll generally manage that in terms of that fluid status. And then at that point, I certainly would be referring to my respiratory colleagues and saying, ""Please optimize their respiratory function as much as possible to help prevent progression of their pulmonary hypertension."""
"No, it largely doesn't. Now obviously, one of the main tool cardiovascular drugs are beta blockers, but generally the vast majority of patients who have COPD can tolerate cardio selective beta blockers. So I would still use them, but I would ensure that any beta blockers used have a significant degree of cardio selectivity."
"And then the only other way it really impinges upon it is if I'm considering certain interventions, particularly more invasive interventions, such as cardiac devices or surgery. If I think that someone's breathlessness is such that their COPD is bad enough so that if I improve their cardiac status, I'm not going to improve their overall quality of life because their breathless won't improve, then I'm less likely to perform an invasive, put someone through the risks of an invasive procedure. If I know they're going to get any benefit from that."
"I think it's a reasonable number. I think it's getting close to... It's probably just under 20%, I suspect."
"Yeah, maybe it is about 20%. And one of the reasons for that is smoking of course, is such a major risk factor for cardiac disease. And it's a major risk factor for  inaudible 00:18:10  disease."
"Under my care? I'd say about two thirds of the respiratory disease, at least under my care, is probably COPD. At least. Maybe more."
"If they've got heart disease? How concerned am I? I wouldn't say I'm concerned. I expected it. I anticipate it's going to happen. And I obviously need treating promptly when it does happen. And obviously the COPD exacerbation can often be enough to trigger decompensations of their cardiac status as well. But I wouldn't say I'm concerned about it, because it's just an inevitability. Particularly in the months these patients have exacerbations with their COPD."
"Probably not. If I'm managing them long term, no. I don't even bother asking. I'm often aware and I know if I see them in clinic, if they've been admitted to our local hospitals, I'll be aware that's happened probably, but I don't specifically ask that information."
"Well, I mean, that's such a broad question, I guess. So there is-"
"Well, the first thing is they've got the... Smoking's probably the most prominent causal agent of both. There's no doubt that when you have an exacerbation of... Well, particularly if your COPD, it can precipitate a decompensation in someone's heart failure."
"As I discussed, COPD in itself can cause some cardiac conditions. COPD can cause pulmonary hypertension, and then right-sided heart disease. So heart failure and even valvular disease on the right side. So to that effect, there's something that people aren't as widely aware of, which is COPD can cause..."
"COPD is definitely linked to a stress cardiomyopathy known as Takotsubo disease, which is becoming increasingly prevalent. And we see more and more of that. And there's probably some nice data now to show that link. And then also COPD can also... That as we've discussed in some people, it can affect your ability to tolerate cardiac medications, particularly the beta blockers, which are a mainstay of management of cardiac disease. So that's the main way they're interrelated."
"Good question. I suspect it probably does. I'm just not necessarily aware of that, I guess, because I don't focus on that as much."
"At least acutely, but then also for the same reasons I've just discussed, that there were patients where it causes their cardiovascular disease."
"Well, if you well manage, you're less likely to precipitate the cardio conditions that we said it can cause, but as much as any of that, these patients... What a patient doesn't really care about a... What diseases they've got, they care about how they are, is much more important from what they can do in day to day life. So more holistic care and management to their breathlessness to that patient is much more important in terms of their overall end function than optimizing the management of one specific disease."
"Yes. It's not a surprise, really. We know how it's related. They are, as you say, that's not a surprise at all."
"Yeah. I guess you're more likely to die really from cardiovascular disease than you are from respiratory disease. I guess that is kind of what it's saying. If you've got lung disease and you're adding heart disease, your mortality really does shoot up."
"Not really because I... We know how likely you are to die off from cardiac disease. And most of our patients... Of course, I might get a slightly biased view because I see what I see. So I'm seeing the people whose heart disease is worse, but you do get the impression, a lot of people who got combined heart and lung disease. It's often is their heart disease that kills them."
It's interesting data I wasn't aware of. I didn't know this. It's not necessarily a surprise. You can imagine all the body's immune responses and the fact that probably the whole disease process is also prothrombotic as well.
"So I'm not necessarily surprised to see that there's an increased risk of a cardiovascular event in the days after an exacerbation of COPD. Of course, what that data doesn't show is whether or not there's actually a true increased risk, or you just bring that forward by a small bit."
"So these were events that were going to happen within the next yea, in any case. And they just happen at an earlier time point. So you've been able to measure them over the next 10 days. I suspect there's... I suspect it's a part, bits of both. And I suspect there really is increased risk of a cardiovascular event associated with an exacerbation of COPD, but this data doesn't answer that."
"Is this logical alongside that? Yes, of course it is. I mean, this is something... This is different really. But it's, as I said, it's not data I've necessarily seen. It's not a surprise. We know when patients are in hospital, there is..."
It's not completely uncommon that someone presents with one condition then does have a second event. Clearly there is an association. I have no idea the magnitude of the association. So it's useful data to see this.
"Well, again, that's very true and it will be a combination of both. And the way to know that would be, if it's been recorded, the data should show that. I would've thought it increases the risk of both, in all honesty. You don't really get a type two stroke, having said that. And there seems to be an increased risk of stroke in that period afterwards. So if you're getting a stroke is the same as a brain attack."
"If you like, the stroke's more like your type one heart attack affecting the brain. So if you do have the increased risk of stroke... Here they're saying 40% over a 10 day period, then it would seem likely there's an increased risk of ACS. So type one myocardial infarction. But of course there's a significant increase in type two events as well. I must... I looked at this data  inaudible 00:30:43  consider that I'd presume someone when I see the word MI, I'd presume someone focused on acute coronary syndrome and MI is a slightly broader term and you're entirely right. There'll be a combination of both."
"Probably very valid. The devil would be in the detail and you'd have to... So, the way you'd find that out is you read the study and you look at what they've included and whether or not they've included what diagnosis they've used for myocardial infarction."
"Whether they've used it in a very broad sense or whether they've limited to acute coronary syndromes. You think they have, I mean, that would be the logical thing to do in this study."
"That it should just be looking at acute coronary syndromes. Because that's kind of what they're getting at here, that there's the increased risk of acute thrombotic events. So I either thought if the study was well done, they were... They'd limited it to acute coronary syndromes."
"Well, I'm not necessarily concerned about it, but it depends. So if someone has... Not all type two events are the same. And actually, in the number of these patients, they'll be small detectable evidence of troponin in the blood system at the any point in time."
"However, if someone had... The larger the magnitude of the rise in troponin, and particularly if coupled with changes on the ECG would increase by concerning risk of them having an acute coronary syndrome over the next period of time and increase the likelihood I would wish to intervene."
"Yeah, well it's exactly as I said. You basically have to form risk stratification. You are right. What a type two MI just means you've got supply demand mismatch. So because they've got less oxygen in their blood system, perhaps because of an exacerbation of their COPD, that means they're more likely to be experiencing myocardial ischemia and the treatment's going to be that of managing their COPD."
"However, the greater the type two infarct in terms of the metrics, the blood tests, the ECG. It would suggest that there's more obstruction within the coronary arteries and the more the obstruction of the coronary artery, the more likely they are to be either symptomatic or to develop an acute coronary syndrome or a type one MI at some point in the future. So those patients you deem at the highest risk you'd consider for manage and even invasive management in a subsection of those patients."
"I'm not convinced it does massively. I guess we already know intuitively if we want the best for our patients, we want all their conditions to be as tightly managed as possible. But does it change it? Not necessarily. Not massively from beyond what I already know."
"Yes, I agree. I think as I said at the very beginning, kind of my... The knowledge of my COPD management is largely that if these patients are on different things that they need to be on, I can recommend them."
"And for me, often the easiest thing is to recommend what, a combined inhaler that's got all three in and then, you know that they crudely, from a cardiology perspective, I've done a lot of what I can do for these patients, if I'm worried the COPD isn't optimized."
"It's kind of backs off my own management, if you like.I didn't know what the size of the reduction was, because this isn't data that I would tend to remember because it's respiratory. But it's not a massive surprise."
"Of course, these numbers to... The only other thing to say is the graphs being very largely magnified and the numbers needed to treat are quite small, even though you've got quite a large relative or quite a big relative benefit, the absolute benefit isn't absolutely gigantic. Having to treat COPD patients. But this mirrors my own management."
"Well, what I'm saying is that... The absolute benefit is perhaps not as big as I thought that it might be needing to treat 80 patients to prevent one death."
"Yeah. And obviously now that becomes a bit more of a surprise that actually the reduction death is cardiovascular. Even though we do know these patients die, as we said that earlier from cardiovascular disease, more than there are other things, but it is in some ways a bit interesting. So you manage their COPD correctly. Then what you do is you stop them dying from cardiac disease. So that is actually quite interesting."
"Well, you'd have to go back and hypothesize the story that you've been trying to tell here. The flow from a story you're trying to say is that you reduced the number by optimizing COPD management to reduce their exacerbations and that reduces their risk of decompensated cardiovascular disease, be it in a coronary, cerebro vascular event or a decompensation of their heart failure."
"No. I mean the same thing seen as about 50% reduction, really. In a boat cardiovascular event or a cardiovascular event being on both well beyond product X, as compared with not having the inhaled corticosteroid. And it really does show, highlight the importance of having a inhaled corticosteroid as part of management."
"Because interestingly, it doesn't look like there's a massive difference in cardiovascular event rates once you make sure those patients are on inhaled corticosteroid. And so it kind of highlights a really, really important part of management, to me."
"No, I was going to say again, this justified my view that I see these patients and what do I do? Certainly the ones in hospitals who aren;t already on a... If they've known COPD and once they've been hospitalized, clearly their COPD management could be better."
"And if they're not already on a triple therapy device, I generally start one and for the COPD nurses. So this is just backing up what I'm doing really."
"Say that all triple device, triple treatments are equal. So I know which inhaled triple combination inhaler I use, but of course, this isn't comparative data of triple therapy versus triple therapy, it's triple therapy versus dual therapy."
"It's interesting, isn't it? I can see why it might be tempting from a pharmaceutical company to go down that route as well, but why can they be helpful? We see to have very strong cardiac network in the UK, and there will be a degree of cardiologists who will take the time to manage patients' comorbidities as well. They generally make very good decisions. And so by getting this message out, it helps increase the number of people who will perhaps pay attention to the patient's COPD and make sure it's optimally managed."
"I've read that. That's interesting, obviously showing superior numbers needed to treat, because what you're doing is you're honing down on secondary endpoint in most of these studies. So this wasn't what the studies were powered to detect. Of course, they've all got very different follow ups."
"These studies as well, some of them may be short, so some of them may be longer and you know timeframe to demonstrate a reduction in death may not be appropriate in some of the lower risk, secondary prevention studies, where this may be a higher risk population. Some of the ones you've already got bad heart and lung disease, you've got in your COPD studies. So I'm not sure you can necessarily draw true conclusions from this, but it's still hypothesis generating data."
"It not that it's not credible, but when you look down, it's a fact, but a study is only necessarily powered to look at what it's powered to look at. And what you're doing is you've taken a lot of secondary endpoints from quite different studies and mashed them together. So if you can't easily compare things as easily as that, I get the correct answers."
"I think the combination of everything you've presented so far does, yes."
"Sorry, I missed the second part of that question."
"Again, would I expect them to be that different? No, I wouldn't. But of course the devil would also be in the detail of the study as well and whether or not they've got a different population."
"So if they had, you'd have to look at everything. You'd have to look at the makeup of the patients, whether they had the same baseline, cardiac status as well. And then also look at the follow up and other factors. So you wouldn't expect that, but the first thing you do is you perhaps look at the reasons for that."
"If anything, probably a little bit more aware, particularly though I was normally most focused on the COPD... Sorry, on the half  inaudible 00:46:43  perspective, whereas this is obviously the risk of myocardial events as well. So it probably makes you more aware of the association."
"You know, I do my absolute best to ensure appropriate lifestyle modifications as well, which we have mentioned. It's such an important part of the management of both conditions. Smoking cessation, obviously being top of the list, but also healthy diets and taking as much exercise as possible."
"We know for when these patients are in hospital, I consider them for oxygen therapy, if I think appropriate and also get, as I said earlier, the heart, the COPD nurses involved. Because we know these patients definitely benefit from... What's the term? Pulmonary rehabilitation as well."
"Well, we do have treatments like this and I have a low threshold, as I say, putting them on these and they come into hospital. I wouldn't need exacerbation of the COPD."
"Not necessarily, no. Obviously I'll be interested to know who you are working on behalf of. Which pharmaceutical company and the product. It's interesting to know what this data relates to."
Okay. That's obviously fine and likely tells me which product. Of course that is as well.
"I'm a GP  inaudible 00:02:32  NHS practice, six doctor practice. We have 11,300 patients. It's an urban practice. And see patients of all ages and backgrounds."
"I suppose mean the triple therapies initially were all for COPD, but a couple of my  inaudible 00:03:16  for asthma. So initially it was all COPD patients. It was probably the moderate to severe COPD patients, patients who were already on steroids, long-acting beta-agonist combination therapy. And you were probably considering the add-on of the LAMA. And it just so happened that there was a product which combined all those three into one. As time's gone on, probably using it more and more and moderate... And even all groups for compliance benefits of it."
"I suppose an episode where the patient's normal maintenance therapy isn't enough, and they have to step up their therapy and this usually involves either formed face-to-face, or hospital   00:04:22  getting steroids or antibiotics."
"Obviously there's a difference between an exacerbation and a moderate COPD patient and a severe COPD patient. And then there's a difference between a severe exacerbation and a moderate exacerbation, obviously.   00:04:53 ."
"A moderate exacerbation probably needs antibiotics, possibly steroids. A severe exacerbation might need either a more prolonged course of steroids or possibly hospital admission."
"I suppose if you were getting them at the diagnostic stage, whether FEV1 was already quite low, so you occasionally get patients who present when they've been treated for a number of years, but they've just never been formally diagnosed as having COPD. So you get someone who's FEV1, less than 40% and you're starting them on an inhaler. You might be inclined to go for something that's going to give the maximum symptom relief. So you're probably looking at combining triple therapy."
First therapy? I would say probably... It could up to 20%.
"Initially there was only two, there was Trelegy and Trimbow. And the difference in those was that one of them was a MDA and the one wasn't. It was one of the breath-activated actually devices, or dry powder devices. And then there was another one came along, Trixeo, which suppose we're starting to use a bit more, but the first two are probably getting used   00:07:05 ."
"To be honest? I was more interested in the practical realities of using the medication. If somebody came to me and they were already on the MDA, I would go for the MDA approach. If they were on the dry powder device  inaudible 00:07:36  the other one, the Trelegy."
 inaudible 00:08:14  but I don't really know any of the results.
"It's quite concerning the fact that it's the third medication in this particular group to come along, and usually by the time the third or fourth agent in a particular group comes along, people, especially prescribers' minds are fairly set with what medications that they're already using from that group. It's probably reasonable, and it's dealing with, there's something different between this and the other two medications that are already out there. And that there's quite good figures for reduction in hospitalizations, or reduction in all-cause mortality, symptomatic relief."
"And it's quite good that it's comparative not only LAMA/LABA, but also to ICS/LABA, because that was in my head initially, that a lot of the first two slides were comparing with LAMA/LABA, but then it did state that you get an extra 18% reduction compared with ICS/LABA also. That was just feeling that you could see that adding on the extra third agent gives you extra benefit as opposed to just the standard ICS/LABA."
"It probably felt quite comfortably with what I already felt whenever I was prescribing. If you go back to what I said in this part, but despite my lack of awareness of study data, et cetera, sort of had a gut feeling that if somebody had moderate COPD or severe COPD, that perhaps if they were  inaudible 00:15:24 , inhaled medication, or even if they were only on, say, a LABA or a LAMA or something like that, got them going for the LABA/ICS or LAMA/LABA and moving straight to the triple therapy, because just had a feeling that giving them the combination of three medications was obviously, although maybe not indicated at that step, what the guidelines would say, it was probably in my head was, if you get them these extra medications, it probably gives them better symptom control, and might help a bit more."
"It's interesting because obviously the marketing company AstraZeneca, and AstraZeneca did quite a good job with Symbicort in conveying this message. So I think the whole exaggeration issue, and the fact that increasing exacerbations causes difficulties with mortality, and hospitalizations et cetera, is something that falls on quite nicely from what the messages that the reps would've been conveying for Symbicort. It is quite insightful, obviously, if you use this medication, then it's got these benefits."
"Yeah. That was quite interesting. Whenever I saw the figure about one in five people who get an exacerbation that year and the year after, I was thinking of the number people that we see actually with exaggerations and who we give steroids et cetera. And if you think that one on every five is possibly could be dead within a year, that is quite a startling figure."
"It probably sits again with great with... I didn't know an awful lot about Trixeo, to be honest. And it's been because we haven't been seeing reps, and we haven't had a lot of contact with reps recently. And the other thing actually is the AstraZeneca rep who worked in this area has just retired, so that might be also actually why I haven't heard much about Trixeo. And they would've been quite good at conveying that particular message about Symbicort too, so it fits quite well with what I already have in my mind that-"
"If you were thinking to yourself that the mortality, the reduction in hospital admission and death et cetera. If the study data that's available or present is only applicable to this medication because it's the only medication that has looked at these issues, and the other two medications in the class don't have the comparable study data, then you'd have to argue that you'd use this particular medication."
"... is that the other medications in the group, i.e., Trelegy and Trimbow, I'm not aware that they have similar data with regards to hospitalizations, reductions of mortality. And if they don't, it would seem a fairly good reason that you should probably be using Trixeo as your first time triple therapy."
"It probably hasn't really changed where I would consider using triple therapy, but it probably has changed that my consideration of the triple therapy  inaudible 00:20:15 ."
"Sure. It hasn't changed where I would consider using triple therapy, but it has changed which my consideration of which triple therapy I would use."
"So obviously based on what you've told me, I would probably be deciding more towards the product that was presented until I was given compelling data by the other company that they had similar reductions."
"I suppose the only thing that, if you were being absolutely riskless, you would compare your product with the other two products in the  inaudible 00:22:29  group, and show that your product works better."
"If you were looking for wider use, you're probably going to have to change your invocation to perhaps be use for using for mild, moderate, and severe COPD. And they include my patients who have had an exacerbation. That'd be the only thing I can think of, because if you're going by your actual medication indications, then you've limited the use of the medication to moderate and severe COPD."
"It been quite some time since I had, for those particular reps. But I can't remember similar data being presented."
"Obviously Trimbow was the first, so because it was the first, like any medication that's first in class, it tends to stick your head a bit. Whenever I think of a triple therapy, irrespective of today's quite compelling presentation, it's probably the one that's going to pop up first, but-"
... the only thing I ever really recalled about it would be that it was an MDA.
"Yes, because you've given me quite compelling data about how many people can die after an exacerbation, and that the medication that was detailed today actually reduces exacerbations, and reduces the risk of all the things that can happen after exacerbation. So obviously if you're a doctor you won't be trying to just keep  inaudible 00:25:18  dying."
"Just because the data that's been presented is in relation to the medication, and it follows on directly from number one that increased those  inaudible 00:25:39  treat."
"I'll go for a five, because you've told me in your presentation that it is different from others, and that it has these effects, but obviously this is an AstraZeneca presentation, so I don't know if this was done by Trelegy or Trimbow, whether they're the same thing. So I'll just err on the side of caution and go for five."
"Well, I suppose what you're saying is that you've clearly given the definition of what an exacerbation is. So anybody who was slightly unaware of what exacerbation was knows exactly what the facts relate to, which is useful because, I think sometimes an exacerbation to one doctor might be slightly different to an exacerbation than another doctor."
"Even myself, I had the perception there that an exacerbation probably meant when you get steroids and antibiotics, but it even includes people that are symptomatic on their current therapy, which is probably a group of patients that are maybe missed at times, because if they do review of their COPD therapy every three to six months, then... Because they'll get symptoms in between time, but just so happens that they don't need antibiotics or steroids. So we're not really coming to our... We're not really becoming aware  inaudible 00:28:03 ."
"Oh, it's very credible, because it fits with... I suppose it probably fits quite well with what you had a feeling was the figures, anyway. I know there's an awful lot of talk about exacerbations and both COPD and asthma, and that increases your chances of death, and it's probably something we had in the back of our minds that the figures probably are quite high, and reinforces the thought that I had that were probably there anyway."
"What I chose is that your exacerbation increased hospitalizations. Obviously we're trying to keep people out of hospital. One in five people die, which is... I think the one of people die is probably the most standout figure there. And I suppose the fact that it's in the center of the screen draws you to that. But then it also shows that it increased the risk of other conditions like heart attacks, which again cause people to die."
It's pretty stark. It certainly gets your attention.
"I suppose it's focusing a bit more on the patient, the group of patients that I mentioned when I said they'd probably go unnoticed, i.e., the patients who aren't actually getting steroids or antibiotics, but they're sitting at home, symptomatic on their current therapy. And that actually equates to exacerbation, and then that equates the higher risks that are associated with exacerbation."
"It doesn't draw you in as much as the original, but some of the... The first line there, ""Patients who are symptomatic in current therapy are at risk of future exacerbations."" I have a feeling that if you took that line and put it in the original slide, it might make the original slide even better."
"And if you put, instead of the next line, the bit about 50% of exacerbations go unrecorded, if you put that in brackets after the first line and move the whole thing into the first slide, that would..."
"I'm again on the original, that it's more talking about the patients who I give out steroids to, and they're the ones who are going to be at  inaudible 00:32:12  this one, sort of makes me think, ""Well, what about all the other patients who I'm not actually giving steroids to, because I'm not seeing them?"" But they're sitting, home-monitoring therapy and they're getting these exacerbations. So it's actually making me think you should be a bit more proactive and trying to target these people, or make sure that they're not sitting home with symptoms."
"It like the second one, but   00:33:13  effective."
"I mean it's all good stuff, but it would probably be the second or third page of leaflet. It wouldn't be first page. The slide that we were talking about, the first slide we saw, would be page one, because that gets your attention. This one that makes you think more about it, but I'm not sure whether, if this was on the first page, it would draw you in as much. Certainly, I think that the first thing that draws you in, and then if you page two or three, then you would add this, then you would be thinking even more about it."
"Because, if was going to be honest, these are only to try and draw people's attention and try to make them think, ""I'm a GP. I know the way other GPs think."" We're not going to go looking for 10 particular studies about this particular medication. If you say that something is twice the rate, or three times... If you're just reading a leaflet or something, it's a lot more impactful than writing what the actual rate is and saying... To say the rate of healthy people with COPD was 0.1%. So   00:35:08  if you were saying 0.3%, you think, well, ""It's the only 0.3%,"" but if you say, ""Three times more likely..."""
"Well, it follows on from the first slide where it suggests that you can have two times of risk of the heart attack. So this just builds on that. So you started thinking about it. You move to the next page and you're seeing this now and you're thinking, ""All right, that's building on that."" But I think those GPS would probably be aware that COPD is a condition that causes problems with social interaction, problems with now health, and all these different things that you've mentioned there."
"Generally, it controls all the same messages."
"Well, I suppose the fact that everything's together just makes you think that you're talking about the one patient, and all these things will happen in the one patient, and that controlling their COPD will help with all these other things in the one patient. So just emphasize the need to control their COPD."
Yeah. And then the last one showed me is the second.
"The medication? Because the purpose of the medication is to treat COPD, so the very fact that the first one,  inaudible 00:40:46  the fact that it only takes one of these aspects in  inaudible 00:40:48 , and then it gives how many people die within a year. But whenever I'm reading about the medication, if I'm only reading a one page advert... The fact that it does these things for the COPD is what initially that draws me in and prescribing the therapy. And obviously we've heard by the fact that it helps all our body systems like mental health, et cetera, because that's not primarily what I'm actually interested in."
"And some of the other slides that you showed me there, I would actually think that if you were producing, no one ever hands me something and it's a leaflet, and there's an inside and a metal page, et cetera, I would put those things on the inside. You've mentioned there on your first page, exacerbation increased the risk of MI, so you've started thinking that it's helping all our body parts or all our body organs. And then you draw the in further on page two, but that's primarily not what I'm interested in. What I really want to know is, does it actually help the patient's COPD?"
"I suppose because of the idea that when you remember, you can remember because of the picture, and you can remember that COPD, if you treat the exacerbation, it helps all these other body systems too, but the lung function obviously is at the top."
That the medication reduces exacerbations 50% compared to LAMA/LABA and 18% compared to ACS/LABA.
"Well, it's backed up by figures. Whenever I'm doing these interviews, I'm always thinking about the reps sitting the front of me, and I'm looking at the detail that they're presenting to me. I looked at the headline and then I've looked at the figures, and I'm thinking in the 20 seconds that takes, those figures seem to be quite good compared to the headline. And that both seem to be fairly convincing."
"To be honest, I think with the graphs it's better, because there's something about a graph, isn't there, that makes you remember, and the fact that it's lower."
"It's quite impressionable. You think, ""That bar is lower than that bar."""
"It's saying that only Trixeo. Just exactly what you're saying, but as opposed to the other triple therapies."
"Because at the end of the day, you're saying that only Trixeo prevents exacerbations, first is LAMA/LABA. But could probably also put, ""Only Symbicort,"" or, ""Only Seretide,"" or ""Only Relvar,"" but they probably do because there's a steroid in them."
Because you're not comparing it to ICS/LABA. You're comparing it to LAMA/LABA.
"I preferred the original again, because to the question whenever I see that on the original slide, and it's like, okay, but you're comparing it with the LAMA/LABA, and in my head LAMA/LABA don't adjust exacerbations generally, because it's a steroid component of the inhaler I have in my head, that adjusts exacerbations. So I'm looking to see what's the comparison with the ICS/LABA, and the fact in the original slide, that you had that 18% reduction, that my mind immediately looks at that."
"I probably would've thought not a lot, because you're not comparing it to what I consider is the exacerbation-relieving medication,  inaudible 00:46:49 , because LAMA/LABA may only treat symptoms. It doesn't treat the exacerbation."
You get 20% back of hospitalization versus ICS/LABA.
"Well, I suppose it depends what you consider powerful, but I suppose 20% reduction versus conventional therapy is probably powerful enough."
"A 20% reduction is one in every five patients. And if you think that on every patients doesn't have to go to hospital, you probably think that would be powerful, I think."
"But at the end of the day, if it was 10% reduction, that's right  inaudible 00:49:31 . You write whatever you want."
Same as the last time. It doesn't strike me as much as a graph.
"Well there's suppose the only thing you can see is that the p-value for the ICS/LABA, it's significant, whereas as actually you mentioned, that it's not significant or LAMA/LABA."
"Probably better with the original one, aren't you, one in every five. Whenever you look at 20% reduction in rate of COPD hospitalization, I'm thinking that's one in five patients. But now you're telling me it's only one in every 31. So you're probably better off just sticking... If you want to be, kind of assume if you want to be honest, you'd go with the one in every 31, but if you only see all your medication, you probably best go with the 20% and leaving the person to work out themself."
"I mean, it's quite a good slide in that it... You think to yourself, well it does work better than the LAMA/LABA and the ICS/LABA. And the figures are quite good. So it probably does provide powerful protection against hospitalization, but you always have a quick scan with your eyes through everything. I don't know what that p-value is unadjusted, because it's now  inaudible 00:52:36  the KRONOS study, but it makes me think that you're hiding something, and it would make me, sorry, slightly dubious about whole thing."
"Well, it sort of builds on the original slide and adds a bit more, but..."
"Well, I suppose it's telling you that the medication reduces hospitalizations and it also is better than both  inaudible 00:53:31 , so ICS/LABA and LAMA/LABA."
"Not really, because it's all only just telling me what's in the graph. It's putting it up in bold figures on the right."
"The last one was probably overall a bit better, but those messages that are at the bottom about p-values and stuff like that, I don't necessarily think that they makes things more believable."
"One, two, four, three. No sorry, one, four, three, two."
I prefer the graph because I like the way that you can see the reduction.
"The messages are essentially the same, only the graphs, you're forced to-"
"Just an updated  inaudible 00:57:57  graph. I suppose, just to me, it's just a graph of obviously some sort of different data because it's going in the opposite direction from normal. Again, it's pretty much the same math, except I would be thinking, I wonder what a survival CAP and AR curve is, and I wonder how you work that out."
I think it said that in the original slides too.
Makes you feel that it's worth prescribing. If you can see one in every 80 patients that use it.
"It's actually a very good slide. It's a very... Whoever's thought about this slide is obviously quite intelligent because the four studies mentioned there are landmark studies. The  inaudible 00:59:48 , Heart Protection, HOPE, and the UK Perspective Diabetes Study landmark studies in their individual therapeutic areas."
"When I think that  inaudible 01:00:03  a lot of my prescribing around about the use of statins, blood pressure medications, diabetes medications, on these particular studies. And yet you see the reduction of the lives  inaudible 01:00:18  studied, and you compare that with the 1.2% in Trixeo, and it immediately makes you think, ""Well, Trixeo is actually doing better than the medications that I recommended."" These other studies, even though they are the ground work for prescriptions of medications by the million."
"Well, obviously, it changes your view in that you're saying to yourself, ""I'm not just prescribing this to improve their breathing,"" but I'm actually using this because you were looking beyond breathing and was thinking that, the overall better-associated it with COPD extends to patients dying. And if we prescribe this particular medication, then the actual reduction in the number of death is quite considerably higher than some of the best studies that have been done in our areas."
And then can you show that last one again?
"I'll probably just stick with the first one, then."
"I think I said this few times, it probably is worth including, because whenever the word exacerbation is mentioned, I think you automatically get in your head that you're talking about the patients who are sitting in front of you and saying, ""Look, I feel really bad,"" and you give them steroids. Whereas what this is saying is that there's a big group of patients, probably a lot more patients than the ones that you actually ever see, who are sitting at home with these exacerbations that are unreported, because basically what it is that they're on they're on particular inhaled therapy and they're having symptoms that they haven't told you about."
"So I think including this message makes you think, ""Well, I need to be a bit more proactive in how I deal with this group of patients. I actually need to go looking for the ones that are having symptoms, the ones that are having exacerbation, the ones that aren't controlled, as opposed to waiting for them to come and see me."" And obviously if you're going, looking for patients and identifying, and if you're optimizing their health therapy, then you're probably thinking about using the medication that's being presented."
I think the previous one that you showed me there was better.
"I mean, ""Did you know one in two exacerbations go unreported?"" It probably makes you prescribe more than if you flick on to the other one, the first thing that you see... Where's the second one again?"
"Three quarters of patients did not have an exacerbation last year. So you're trying out the first thing you see there is, ""Oh, that's grand. Nobody's having exacerbations. Three quarters of them having  inaudible 01:06:05  exacerbations."" Whereas the previous side makes you think everybody's having exacerbations and we're not picking them up."
I would go for that. I'd go for this one.
"Just because of the headline. The other one said three quarters of people don't have any exacerbations, this one's saying one of two go unreported. So what I'm thinking about is the patients who I am actually seeing and the patients who I'm giving steroids to, and I'm thinking, ""Well, if one in two go unreported, that means that there's at least that many again, that I'm not seeing, who I probably should be looking at to add this particular medication because of what we showed in the very first slide, that it was just as hospitalizations, and just as mortality. And even the fact that if I give two patients an inhaler, probably one of them will die."
"Got to be careful because I have to go by what your indication is. I wouldn't have a problem using it, but I think you'd have to look at what the medication indication was."
"Yeah, not too bad. Okay, good. We've got no video lag or anything and I can hear you clearly, and that's all good. Okay. So this is being recorded. So I'll jump straight in. I'll go through the legal bits and pieces and then we'll look through this, okay?"
"Good. So the purpose of the study is to evaluate a selection of COPD campaign materials. So it's going to take about 60 minutes. Research is conducted in compliance with SMIM or SMFRA and BHBIA guidelines. We comply with all relevant laws, protect your personal data. You have the right to withdraw if you need to at any time. Your response will be used by the sponsoring company, which is a pharmaceutical company for market research purposes. Your response will be treated in confidence and not used for any other purposes or disclosed to a third party without your approval. Your response will combined with other respondents and presented to the sponsor in aggregated or anonymized form. So the interview is audio recorded to help with analysis and the recording may be shared with the brand marketing teams, same as with the video recording, to help with our analysis."
"Again, shared with the brand and marketing team from the sponsoring company for market research purposes, which is agreed in the consent form that you signed. Also, I have a few colleagues that are observing this interview. As we go through, you might hear me sort of tapping away on the keyboard. We just communicate through the chat window so we can have a nice sort of a verbal conversation without any interruptions. Also in accordance with the general GDPR, you have the right to know the name of the sponsoring company, which we can inform you of. We can inform you of the sponsor at the end of the interview."
"If it comes up, very much doubt if it will, but adverse events, we are required to pass on for our client's needs. Even if you've already reported them. It happens, I normally just wait until the end. We go through it together. You tell me whether or not you want your name and contact details attached to the adverse event. If you do, rest of the discussion remains confidential, if you don't, I still report it. I just do so anonymously and that's a lot. So after that long preamble are we all good to go?"
"Great. All right. First all, just give me a couple of sentences. Just tell me your specialty and the type of prep setting that you're working in, please/"
"Okay. Okay. And we're just going to go straight into this. I don't want to sort of spend too much time, don't mean to sound dismissive, but we have got quite a lot of materials, but I just want to get some sort of basic landscape stuff. So first of all, what was the difference in prescribing between LAMA/LABA and ICS LABA, differences between the two just briefly, couple of sentences."
No problem. And what would be the typical definition of a moderate exacerbation and what would be a typical definition of a severe exacerbation?
Lovely. And under what circumstances would you start a patient on triple therapy as their first maintenance therapy?
All right. Then what percentage would that roughly represent?
"Okay. Yeah. Gives me a good idea. All right then, no doubt you're already aware of the closed triple therapies that are on the market. So you've got Trelegy and Trimbow and obviously Trixeo. What are the key differences between these as you see them?"
"No, I tell you what, if you are looking to put them side by side what's the endpoint that you are sort of comparing on. Because you said, oh, one works better than the other. In what way?"
"Right. Okay then, that's fine. Okay. So what I'm going to do, we're going to review some hypothetical campaign materials for a closed triple therapy product. So, can't stress this enough, not intended to be sort of promotional or influence your prescribing in any way. We just want your honest thoughts and I'll sort of take you through it and we'll pick it apart. So, just speak for yourself. So if you want to sit back, I will start the recording and are you ready? Okay, so let me see current video. Okay. Right. So if someone wants to turn my mic off, here we go."
"Okay, great. So thanks a lot for going through that. So what we can do, is we will pick apart sort of the pages in depth a bit later. So this is not like a test of memory or anything silly like that, but what was your sort of initial thoughts on the presentation that we just went through?"
Okay. So put it all together. What's the main message that they were trying to convey to you as a GP?
"And how does that make you feel? Does that alter your perception? That's the message, but how does it resonate with you?"
"Okay. All right then. So, is that just a general feeling of COPD, or is that specifically for the use of Trixeo?"
"Okay. And also I've got to ask, as well, you mentioned exacerbations, but how has that sort of impacted your perception of the risk of mortality from COPD?"
"Yeah. Okay. All right, so I'm still obviously going to keep going back to this again and again, but how has this sort of impacted your perception of Trixeo, specifically?"
Okay. And what have about if you're comparing it to Trelegy and Trimbo?
"All right then, just in brief. So how does this story and this data, because obviously this is how this was designed to say, a rep would come into your office, they present this, the recordings, their voice over the presentation. How does this compare with what you've heard from the Trelegy rep?"
Okay. What about motivates you to prescribe Trixeo?
"So what else needs to be included in the story to bring that up to a seven or to a six, say?"
"Certainly. Then in terms of differentiates Trixeo from other closed triple therapies that are available on a scale of one to seven, where should I put that?"
"I mean that's an interesting thing to say, because we're sort of marketing this based on the story. So I mean the story I'm getting the sense that this is something new, so it could do the job of differentiating it, but I'm also getting the sense that it raises a lot of questions. So to truly differentiate it, had you're given it like a say five, am I on the right lines?"
"Right. Okay. Lovely. All right. So I know what we're working with rather than just going off cold figures, always good. All right then. So what we're going to do now is we can look at picking apart some of these pages. So what we're going to do is we're going to look at the original, and then I might show you two, maybe three alternatives and then I'll flash them all up on the screen. You can rank them, score them, whatever you want. So I'm just going to do this then just to mess around with the order. Let's have a look where we're going to start with, so for the purpose of our note taker, I'm starting off with page E, original. So first all just take that in again and then put it all together. The design of the slide, the headline, what message is that trying to get across, that particular slide?"
"Okay. All right then. So let's have a look at some of the alternatives. So we'll start with E A. So tell me about this one. What is this saying? What are you getting from this one, if it's any different to the first one? Because obviously these are differentiations on the original. So, of course you could say, well, it's saying the same thing, but in a different way, that's what we're interested in. What else is this adding? You know, is it adding anything?"
"Okay. Then, so let's focus in on that then. So when, you've got this, and you're flicking through this presentation, they go into the efficacy and then straight away you're looking at only Trixeo. What does that put in your mind? How are you reacting to this?"
"Okay, then. So does this, it's a question, does this make it less compelling? Does this make it questionable? Does it make it credible? What does this do when we..."
"Okay. Alright then. And also, you've got in CORONIS, the trial. Are you familiar with that at all?"
Nope. Okay. No problem at all. Let's have a look at the next one here. So here we go. Right. Okay.
"All right, lovely. So once again, if you tell me what's your takeaway from this and what is this adding or what is it not adding?"
Okay. Right then. Okay. So let's have a look. I would like to just sort of make sure I've got everything. So this is roughly a number that needs a  inaudible 00:21:51 . How relevant is this to sort of keep this in? In this sort of slide?
"Okay, then. And what are your thoughts of sort of including just one comparator on, rather than both comparator on?"
"Okay, then, so you would need to see sort of both data versus ICS LABA and LAMA/LABA basically."
"And one more thing, just going back, sorry, just going back on the number needed to treat, is this what you expected in terms of figures there?"
"Lovely. All right. Then let's put them all together. You can see the original there. I know it's a little bit small, but it's more just like an aid to memory. If you need me just to flick up, I can go on to the original slides, but then you've got the alternative and then you've got the alternative that we've just looked at. As it just says, I'd just like to know if the first one here, the only Trixeo is an improvement on the original, in any way. And also the numbers needed to treat slide. The EC one, is there also an improvement on the original?"
"Okay. That's great. Thank you. Brilliant. All right then. So let's have a look then. So what I'd like to do, if you don't mind, I'd like to go row by row. Let me just get my look a bit there. So all I want you to do is just rank them. So if it's all about E A and then following on closely at V C and then the original, just give me a one, a two and a three. So just tell me which one is the first, the original or the alternative E C. Which one?"
"Okay then. So E C. So urgency to treat, which one comes in second?"
Okay. Lovely. And then for motivates me to prescribe?
"Okay. And just as it says there, you've got that differentiator with only Trixeo for the alternative on that one. Okay. What about differentiates from, well you said that was a close second anyway. And then that would be in there at number three. Okay. I think..."
"Oh, sorry. Yes, of course it should. I do beg your pardon, let me just do that. Let me just put that there."
"That's lovely. All right, then let's have a look, then. Let's look at the H, all right then. So once again, this is the original page. On hospitalization. So once again, tell me what this is communicating to you as a GP?"
"No, no, please say it out all you want. I'll give you some questions after you finish processing."
"Okay then, so which one is more compelling then? Is it the ICS LABA or the LAMA/LABA?"
"Okay. All right, good to know. And again, so we're saying powerful protection against COPD hospitalizations."
"Okay. All right, then. So let's put these against the alternatives. Okay. So, all right then. So here we go?"
Excellent. All right. Good. Okay then. So I think we've got a good sort of view of that one. Let's let's try H H B.
"So, okay when we look at the original one, sorry, I'm just getting my, okay. So go back about one slide. Sorry. Beg pardon?"
"Beg your pardon. There we go. Right. So this one here, the 64%, so this one here, we're referring to the CORONIS study. And then HC, we're looking at regions with similar patient care practice, their hospitalizations are reserved for most severe, potential life threatening cases. So you've got different groups of different numbers, so yeah."
Yeah. Quite all right. That's me not framing this correctly. I do beg your pardon.
"Oh, no, sorry. We haven't got a comment on the 64, so sorry. I'm skipping forward. So we've got HB when we got 60.   00:33:29  we got, sorry. Beg your pardon, I'm skipping all over the place."
Okay. All right then. So which one is more sort of powerful? Is it the 20% or 64 or these both need to be shown on here?
Okay. And what's your reaction to the information about regions with similar patient care practice data?
"Okay. All right then. Good. Okay. Let's have a look then. So the handy little ones at the bottom there, I think the numbers sort of jump out, so it's quite, quite good. Quite easy to sort of differentiate them. That's nice. Yeah. So tell me which ones have an improvement on the original please?"
Okay. So what are we saying? Put a nice little neat bow on that. Is it an improvement or not? Do you think?
"For the first page. Lovely. Thank you. All right then. So let's get a few rankings on this. So, in terms of increases urgency to treat, give me the rankings from one to four on that row please."
So in terms of motivates me to prescribe Trixeo?
"Lovely. Brilliant. Okay, excellent. So looking at mortality, then this is the original slide. So thoughts on this one for me, please?"
"So first of all, what are your sort of thoughts and sort of expressions of mortality like reduction in the rate of death or as a survival figure? Let's go look at some of the other ones that make that a little bit more, put that into context a bit better. So if I look at alternative M B, there we go. That's better. Sorry. Jumping the gun."
"Yeah. I think to be honest, that makes it a little bit clearer than the graph. The graph, I'm sort of looking at the axes, trying to work out what's happening over a course of the year and things. So that explains it quite well."
"Is it more impactful just to have, you're drawn straight in to the 49% and a bold arrow graph, rather than having to sort of pick apart something."
"Okay. What about having this? So you said that this one death could be prevented for every 80 patients. This is something that, you're sort of doing this mental arithmetic, trying to put all that together, but how much impact does it have stating this? As well as this reduction in the rate of death? What does that bring to this information about mortality?"
"Okay. All right then, sorry, I'm just going to go on to the next one. Apologies everyone that's observing this. I did put the rotation out of whack for this. I'm sorry. Okay. But let's look at this M C second, there we go."
"So, let's have a look at both of those. So you've got one additional life save every 80 patients treated and you've got the headline, that every life saved matters to their loved ones. Put all that together. Obviously it's a different way of presenting the same sort of core information, but what is that bringing to the table? What's it taking away? How does that resonate with you or not?"
"I see. Okay. I'm just asking a question here. So I have got another page that goes with this, but I think, I'll show it next, because it's just the order of the slides that are presented to me. So hang on. Just give me a second. There we go. So this is designed as a supplemental page. Okay, this will go in addition to whichever one you've chosen, like whether it's the original one or M B or M C. So this will be like a follow up, okay?"
" inaudible 00:48:10  if at all, does this provide an improved sort of context of the mortality reduction for a triple therapy for Trixeo?"
"Okay, I'm going to move on from this, hope you don't mind. Don't want to come across as dismissive, but just working back on these ones. Can you just tell me which ones, if any, would have an improvement on the original then? So if we start off with M D yes or no?"
"Okay. I think we've already gone through some of the reasons on there, so I'll just go straight onto the rankings for this one, please. Okay. Then, so increases urgency to treat. Give me the ranking?"
"Okay. Two and then, differentiates from other closed triple therapies?"
Consistent. That's what we call it. Then let's have a look at the unmet needs then. So I'll zip through these a little bit. Okay. So this is the original one for this one. So nice and simple. What's the main takeaway from this? And is this a credible slide? Just to start off and introduce the alternatives?
"All right. Let's sort a look at the alternatives. So U C, what do we think about how this is laid out? How this is conveying this message? What are we doing with this one? Have we improved on it? Have we not? What have we done?"
All right. Okay. Let's look at U D then. Okay. Very different way of presenting. What are your thoughts on what we've done with this one?
Okay. All right then. So let's look at what if they have an improvement then. Okay.
"Oh, sorry. That, I do beg your pardon. That one wasn't shown or it's not on there. Sorry. I think that's been missed out. Don't worry. That's fine."
"Yeah, for the purpose of this one, we'll forget the U B. We'll just go straight to U C."
"I'll tell you what, tell me what parts of this could be brought into the original, just to make the original resonate a lot better, about that."
"Right. So basically you'd have these three broad categories, and then you'd have a series of bullet points under it, which would just draw your attention to beyond the lung factors."
"I know it's a big ask, but would you mind just zooming in on the alt U B and just give me a little rundown of that slide? I'm sorry, I haven't got it larger. It's just probably going to be a lot easier rather than just load one up."
"Let me see if I could, if you just do like control and your mouse wheel up, would that not do it?"
"Oh, in that case, my knowledge is defunct. I do beg your pardon."
"I really appreciate this. I can read it out if you want. I've got that, or I can share my screen actually. Oh, you're okay."
"Okay. No problem at all then. All right, then. So, sorry, let me just get my  inaudible 00:57:58  guys. All right. There we go. So that's a no. And then what are we saying about U C? Is that overall a no, or a yes?"
"Okay, good. All right, then. Excellent. Okay. If I could just beg a couple more minutes, would that be okay?"
Okay. All right. Let's look at the second one just very quickly. Fine.
"Okay. In that case then I'll just stick onto that one. So this should be sort of added to the slide. So what I'd like to do, just in the last couple of minutes, we looked at quite a few bits and pieces in here in terms of some of the themes. So obviously we looked at the efficacy first, we looked at slides about hospitalization, then mortality, and then finally the unmet need. How should we order that story? What should come first in that order? What themes should come first? Now if you need me to flash up your favorites, I can do that."
"Okay. So which one was, sorry. So the hospitalization that with all H B. So that one comes in secondly."
"Okay, so the unmet need would go in there, just neatly before the mortality."
"Yeah. Okay. Right. So, okay. So I don't think I actually I didn't do the scoring on these ones. So I do beg your pardon. I'm jumping the gun again, look so sorry."
Oops. Sorry. Yep. That's number four. Okay. And then...
Okay. U C and then original is number two.
"Okay. I'm not sure, I would like to ask because obviously I asked what would be the natural ordering of the story? And you said, it's efficacy, then you got the hospitalization, then you got the unmet needs going in neatly before mortality. But I mean, is that the best way to sort of build this story? Do you think? To accurately tell the story about Trixeo, specifically to Trixeo? So I'm trying to just establish whether this is a natural order when you're seeing a triple therapy or something to do with COPD that you would have that there, this is the natural order of things in terms of things that you'd be looking for, but into terms of building a story for Trixeo, does that order still resonate? It should still be."
"Okay. Right. Just to put a nice neat little bow on this. To what extent are these sort of pages that we presented here in this order, encouraged you to actually consider using triple therapy even earlier to help avoid future exacerbations and reduce the risk of mortality?"
"Okay. Alright. Good. So I know it's just a little sort of grab at the percentage, but you said before that you sort of just consider sort of to be the trigger for sort of initiating would be about 5%. I mean, I know it's grabbing in the dark. Well, what do you think that might grow to after seeing this?"
"Okay, good. Okay. Now I managed to cover everything I need to cover today. You've been a brilliant respondent. Is there anything else you feel I've sort of glossed over? Anything else you'd like to sort of add in before we finish for today?"
"Also asking anyone else, the guys that are observing it is anything else they would like to ask me? Let me see. Just waiting for..."
"They're typing, just to catch up with... Okay, nothing from us. Okay. So as mentioned at the beginning, the survey can now be revealed that the research is sponsored by Astra Zeneca. So that's your all done. Thank you so much."
Hello. And thank you RV one. We now have the respondent online. And your moderator's name is Angelina. Angelina your line is open. You may now begin.
"Hello there. Hi, no problem. Hi, how you doing?"
"Fine. So I'm involved in diagnosis, assessment and management of COPD patients across the whole spectrum, mild, moderate, and severe. I'm involved in onward referral if necessary to respiratory consultant if when able to, manage patients acceptably in primary care. So we would typically use a step ladder approach, treating mild symptoms with PRN shot beta agonists, and then move ladder to Lama Laba inhalers, if necessary. And then if patients having frequent exacerbations and or symptomatic despite use of short acting and Lama Laba inhalers, then you'd move up to triple therapy after that."
"Typically, if patients remain symptomatic, such as breathlessness on moderate exertion, or if they're having frequent exacerbations then we move to triple therapy."
"Oh, I think estimate probably anything between 12 to 18 months or even a couple of years, depending on the progression of people's illness. If they continue to smoke, then that could increase the speed at which they would end up on triple therapy. And it's quite variable really. If patients are well controlled on single or dual therapy, then sometimes you don't need to move straight to triple therapy."
"I think so. I think that it's... Yeah, I expect it to increase probably over the next couple of years."
It'll probably just increased awareness amongst practitioners as well as the ease of use of device. It's obviously easier patients to use one device as opposed to multiple devices.
"No, I've not been involved in any sort of online webinars. I mean, I attend a regular GP update forums and the applicative use of triple therapy. I know there's fairly recent studies from the CMJ PBS back advocating the use of triple therapy."
I'm just sort of saying that it's a common problem. It's probably undiagnosed and the leading cause of death.
"I've got to say it's quite bland actually. I'm slightly surprised that it's the second most common cause of an emergency admissions. But yeah, it doesn't stand out."
"The critical point, probably the third leading cause of death."
"Well, so it's quite a bland slide. It's not bright colors. It doesn't jump past at you."
"Really just what it's saying in the ball text and it's COPD is more common, low socio-economic groups, which doesn't surprise me. We know that."
"Not really. I mean, it is not really telling me anything new or anything that I don't know particularly."
Because it's not really telling me anything new and it's not really highlighting the impact of COPD on patients lives. It's just saying it is more common in lower socioeconomic groups.
I'd say six. I mean it's credible it's yeah.
"Again, because it's not really telling me anything new. It's not stimulating me to think differently."
"Okay. So  inaudible 00:14:12  I think that's a slightly newer approach, just highlighting the significant impact even on just for patients having one exacerbation in a further long term impact on the overall level of functioning. And I think that does stimulate you more to think about how to reduce exacerbations in the future."
"I think this is a kind of an emerging message. So yeah, in line with current thinking but I think it's probably a slightly newer message than the previous slides."
"Basically, even just one exacerbation leads to a reduced level of functioning."
"Okay. Similar to the previous slide that exacerbations reduce, just what I was saying on the slide there, reduce lung function and accelerate disease progression. Got to say it's quite a busy slide though."
Nothing new apart from it's explaining just in detail the exact loss of lung function in terms of FEV one.
"Yeah. I think that probably is. Yeah, that is a new message to me actually. But then again, I suppose the milder patients have more function to play with really. People at the other end of the spectrum haven't got much lung function left to decline any further anyway."
"I think it's highlighting the importance of preventing exacerbations, even in your mild to COPD patients to maintain the level of lung function and improve overall quality of life."
"So again, yes quite motivating. So I give that a six as well."
"Yeah, quite startling statistics actually, which I suspect most people are not aware of."
"So yeah. Following one or two acute exacerbations, half people are dead within five years. It's quite a sobering figure, isn't it?"
"So that bottom figure as well, the risk of death increased by 80% with two exacerbations within a year, I wasn't aware of that quite sobering figure either."
"So, probably that's right. Oh okay. So it takes a bit of time to process that actually. It's not immediately obvious-"
"So yeah, it is not immediately obvious what it's trying to demonstrate. It just take a little bit of working out."
"I don't think it's necessary to be honest because I mean, the same message is that it's easier to understand the actual figures that are on the left hand side of the table. It's not exactly the same thing essentially."
"Is all the figures that are published. So yeah, it's just more difficult to interpret it."
Okay. So this again is going to get me to think differently.
"This is getting used to kind of think differently beyond the lungs, beyond the COPD and it's again, it's slightly new information really. I wasn't quite aware of the extra pulmonary impact on COPD exacerbation. So it's just this food for thought, isn't it?"
"So I think it's getting me to think holistically really, rather than just thinking COPD. You got to think about other risk factors for these individual patients, and try and minimize cardiovascular risk factors as well as the importance of preventing exacerbation in the first place."
"Yeah, I wasn't quite aware of the significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events for exacerbation. So it definitely getting me to think differently."
I think the doubling of the risk of MIs and the almost doubling or four percent increase risk of stroke.
It's quite bold as well. It does stand out at you.
Really that your typical COPD patients are unlikely to have COPD in isolation. It's usually part of a chronic disease package. And just getting to think about how multiple chronic diseases affect overall mortality.
Not particularly. I don't think it's telling me anything new really.
"I think because it's not new information, I'd score it about a five really."
"Oh, it's very credible, so I'd give it seven that."
"So probably lower on that, about a five again because it's not new knowledge."
"It's not easy to interpret the key message actually. I mean, I think there's given key messages well they've got in bold at the top that it's cardiovascular disease, common cause of death in COPD patients. But I think especially so in you more moderate and probably mild COPD which... But I don't think it's anything new."
"I got to say it's not actually clear what they are trying to say there. I think they're just trying to say, consider other comorbidities other than COPD. If it's not severe COPD."
Probably quite low because it's not clear what the message is. So about four.
"Well, I think it's quotient very studies, so I'll give it sort of five or six for credibility."
I'll give it six because it's quite in load of studies on the gold six studies.
Four I think because it's unclear and it doesn't really stimulate me to want to sort of change anything.
"Similar to a slide a couple back where it's getting you to think about not just the COPD but also other comorbidities and how respiratory and our respiratory cardiovascular systems are closely interlinked and one can't really affect the, they both affect each other basically."
"It's not new, but I think it's just bringing it to the forefront of your mind."
"Okay. So it's quite sort of succinct and to the point, which I like. Not telling you anything you probably didn't know apart from the account and being on an ICS, a lower risk of exacerbating. So yeah, I like this slide."
"I think that's newer message that's coming through., so I was aware of it, but I don't think it's probably at the forefront of most people's minds."
"Probably not routinely. I mean, these patients would almost certainly have a full blood count done at some point in the 12 months previous. But I think something we probably should include in as part of their annual COPD reviews."
"I think all the three points that they're highlighting there, that it's important to identify patients who are previous exacerbations because they're more likely to have further. And then as we know, further exacerbations significant increased risk and mortality, but also consider doing a full book count to check the eosinophil full count as part of an annual review."
Okay. Don't think it's telling you anything particularly new there. And there's a lot of information within the slide. So it's not particularly attention grabbing that one for me.
Basically the more exacerbations that people have the more they're going to have in the future and show the life expectancy.
"I'm a little surprise first or second median times as long as it is, to be honest."
Because it's not really telling me anything new and it's not really stimulating me to sort of check my management.
"I think probably just to have just slightly less information actually. Yeah, because I think you just skip over it."
"No, I think that's just obvious isn't it?"
"So yeah, it's definitely one of the things that should took you to review Peter's medication and probably increase the medication if they're symptomatic."
"It's quite relevant, I'll give it a five."
"So pretty much if patients have elevated eosinophil account and they're not on a steroid inhaler, then they're increased risk of exacerbation."
"It's not new, but it's newer. I think it's emerging information over the past two or three years or so."
"I think it probably stimulate me to review what we do in practice and include a review of people's accounts routinely, because we're not doing that cause it's not linked to sort of cost payments at the minute."
"So I mean, this is quite familiar slide, concepts kind of in keeping the nice guidelines. So it's not saying anything that you don't know, but I think it's just hammering home the point that if you minimize exacerbations and think about escalating therapy earlier, you're going to reduce the risk of exacerbations."
"Realistically no. I think unfortunately we tend to see patients once have been discharged and looking clinically well, so sometimes it's harder to think about escalating therapy in patients who are essentially asymptomatic."
Yeah. I think that's an important message to sort of get across because that's probably not something that everybody is particularly aware of.
"Probably to arrange review appointments for patients to have a single, moderate or severe exacerbation to think about increasing the maintenance therapy."
"I think they're getting you to think about not just making the diagnosis and treating people's symptoms, but also to consider the longer term patient journey if you like, and think about as well as pharmacological therapy other things that you can do to try and optimize treatment."
"Because it's not really telling me anything that I didn't already know. And yeah, just that reason for me."
"Getting quite low, probably about five again because it's not telling me anything new really."
"Basically, you need to consider not just COPD but the increased cardiovascular risk as well, even just a single exacerbation significantly reduces lung function and increases, or decreases if you like, life expectancy and that the triple therapy significantly reduces your risk of further exacerbations."
"I mean, it certainly would stimulate me to review how we manage our COPD patients in our practice, specifically looking at the eosinophil count and whether or not people need to be on a steroid inhaler as well, if they're not already. And also to ensure that we arrange primary care review for people once discharged with even a single exacerbation to consider escalation of therapy."
"Suppose the challenge will be to get all the clinicians within the practice to be thinking along the same lines, specifically in terms of the eosinophil field counts. I think that's fairly new data and the new way of thinking, and to ensure that we review people even after a single admission for an exacerbation."
"I mean, certainly some of those earlier figures were quite startling. What was it? 50% of people with an exacerbation would want to exacerbations will be dead in five years."
"That is quite a stark statistic, isn't it?"
So I wasn't quite aware of just how poor a prognosis just one admission is really.
"So basically, product X reduces exacerbations compared to Lama Laba or sort of separate devices, ICS and Lama Laba inhalers, low NNT for both of those. I think the first slide was talking about reduce all cause mortality, wasn't it?"
"Just reducing the exacerbations. Fine. So product C basically reduces exacerbate and all calls mortality compared to Lama Laba and separate inhalers, ICS, Lama Laba's."
"It's fairly compelling really. It works. I mean, I'd have to study the statistics a little bit more, but the fairly narrow confidence intervals and low P values and low NT. So it would also all suggest that it's fairly compelling really."
"So, I think it's fairly compelling and overwhelming really, isn't it? Yeah."
"So I think really we should be thinking about it in not just our severely symptomatic patients, but also the more moderate patients who even after a first exacerbation and especially patients who have established comorbid disease as well."
"I do yeah, especially in terms of other comorbidities and just from a single exacerbation, but also thinking about how we review our patients specifically looking at the eosinophil count."
"So probably slightly old 60, 70 year old patient with hypertension or established ischemic heart disease, who's had a single exacerbation, who's just done dual therapy probably wanted to put them straight on triple therapy."
"I think it's just because it's too busy really. I think if you wanted to tell a story and get a sort of high impact message for me, I'd probably just skip over that one."
"I'd probably leave that in because I think it's a nice summary of everything before, although it's not telling anything new."
"I be on the fence with that one. I don't think he's telling you anything new, but I don't think it's a critical message at all."
"So in a nutshell, it's an extremely common condition, third leading cause of death in the UK, but a single exacerbation significantly increases or cause mortality 50% within the five year period. Important to consider routine review of full blood count and eosinophil levels. And if they're raised consider steroid inhaler to reduce exacerbations. And triple therapy has been shows reduced in the rate of exacerbations and reduced all cause mortality."
"Within yeah, mortality sorry, within five year period as well. That really does make you think doesn't it?"
"And you. Okay, thanks very much. All right cheers."
"Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for patiently waiting. We now have our doctor on the line."
"Yeah, no that's fine. Just to say, is all this going to be on this number, or will it be via the computer?"
"All it is is, this is a mobile, so I'm not sure if the reception's going to be great. I've got a landline number. I don't know if you want to use that instead?"
"Yes, so Consultant in Respiratory Medicine. My interest is COPD. I've done research on COPD. I'm a clinical lead for COPD in my hospital."
"So we have more of a potentially elderly, more deprived cohort in the area where I work. So, significant rates of smoking and deprivation. By the time they come to me, generally they are on the more severe side, so patients having a lot of exacerbations and poor control. So yeah, I don't see many of the very mild cases. It's more of the severe end."
"I have both inpatients and outpatients, so certainly in a month, I'd expect to see probably 40 odd inpatients, and as an outpatient again probably around 50 outpatients per month."
"The majority. So, I'd say about 80% actually."
"Well it's supposedly towards the end of the pathway, but given the level of symptoms and exacerbations, a lot of our patients are on that triple therapy."
"Firstly, it's a question I guess of where the diagnoses come from. Certainly, Primary Care are probably better than they used to be in that they all diagnose it now and start patients. Whether they start on  inaudible 00:05:58  medication or not, the LABA-LAMA got a bit interrupted by COVID. So, I think you still will get patients potentially monotherapy as opposed to LABA-LAMA or LABA-ICS."
"They tend to come to us at that kind of point where they're on either LABA-ICS or LABA-LAMA, or just on LAMA monotherapy. So, there will be a lot of introduction of triples by us."
"Yeah, so generally it will either be poor symptom control, or they're having exacerbations. So if it's poor symptoms it should be a trial of triple therapy, ideally for three months. With exacerbations you have to wait slightly longer. I think what I would say is once you start triple therapy I think it's very hard to decide when you should then come off because a lot of them it's very hard to assess symptomatically has it made a difference or not? Exacerbations ideally you probably maybe have to give it a year before you can see if there's any significant improvement in exacerbations, and I think given how these patients are, I'm always ... I would be reluctant in stopping treatment that could be beneficial. So I think in reality once you're on triple therapy I'm not convinced that lot of patients are actually going to come off it."
"I think certainly anyone that's had probably one severe exacerbation, IE hospital admission, or at least probably more than two moderate exacerbations then you're looking to improve on what they're on."
"Yeah, so firstly it's the story, the history about what exact symptoms, is it the pure breathlessness, or have they got wheeze and cough? Could it be cardiac? So any ankle swelling or orthopnea. So the history's vital, obviously smoking history, occupational history, family history. What medications they're on, so lot of information there. Then examination mainly of the heart and lungs. Basic investigations such as chest x-ray, oxygen levels, and then it's a ... I think by that point you'll have a rough idea of what's wrong, and you might need further tests like lung function or CTs or echos, and I think once you've got that then you should have pretty good idea of where the problem is."
"In reality yes, because the two can be linked. So obviously if you've just got breathlessness, you need to do the full examination anyway, and then consider both anyway. Even when you know you've just got a respiratory patient, obviously you can get cardiovascular complications, so I think when you're looking at these kind of patients you are looking at both systems together."
"So let's say we've got an echo with poor LV function then I think you would be suggesting to Primary Care to refer to a cardiologist for work up and potential treatment really, so I think your job as chest physician is to exclude chest pathology, but I think if we find cardiac then we would then go back to the Primary Care. Sometimes Primary Care would manage that themselves, obviously if they want cardiology then they would then refer to cardiology."
"So firstly if a patient is now diagnosed with COPD, you want to know the severity of the COPD, you want to know what their symptoms are, what their exacerbation frequency is. Then basically things like what's their smoking status, obviously if they're still smoking you want to address that. Would they  inaudible 00:10:20  something like pulmonary rehabilitation, you want to assess that. Ideally do that. Then you look at pharmacotherapy, are they already on any treatment? If not, you would start appropriate medication, ensuring inhaler technique training. And then I guess you would follow up, either yourselves or get Primary Care to follow up and see where they've got to."
"Oh a huge amount. So certainly most of the patients I see will have at least one or two comorbidities, some will have three or four, so a lot will have comorbidity."
"Yeah, so it would be things like ischemic heart disease, diabetes, hypotension, osteoporosis, I think those would be the top ones."
"Yeah I think it would be ischemic heart disease, number one."
"I think there's generally known now to be this link between the inflammation that we see in airways disease and inflammation that can contribute to adverse mortality cardiovascular wise. And we know that things like cardiac events can be linked to things like exacerbations, I think there's very good data for that now. We know the interventions that can reduce exacerbations have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. So certainly heart ... so obviously cardiovascular events can be terminal, whereas something like high blood pressure or diabetes is not necessarily terminal. So I think the cardiovascular ones would be the most concerning to me."
"I probably wouldn't be managing any of them myself, I would leave that to Primary Care or something more specialized to be looking at that."
"Yeah I mean that's interesting, in terms of risk because ideally you want to be thinking about things like cholesterol, and stuff like that. But I guess we would leave that more to Primary Care."
"If I saw someone and I thought there was something obvious, say for example someone with ischemic heart disease who was not taking aspirin, or who I thought benefit from say a beta ... something like that, then I would always make a recommendation to Primary Care. I would say, this is my suggestion, by all means consider it or refer to a specialist. So I wouldn't necessarily instigate treatment myself for something which is not my speciality, I'd be making recommendations based on what I think from a general medical background, but for then for Primary Care to either consider or refer to the appropriate specialty."
"Sorry, you say non-cardiac risk factors? Or known cardiac-"
"Known ... oh a lot of them, so a lot of them will be  inaudible 00:14:03 , a lot of them will be diabetic, a lot of them will have  inaudible 00:14:06  family history, so I think probably about 70% of COPD patients are going to have some cardiovascular risk factors if not higher."
"It is something that ... so for example if someone's going to do pulmonary rehab, they have to be stable from a cardiovascular point of view, so you're always asking, are getting any chest pain when you mobilize? And that sort of thing. So at all times these assessments linked, we're always looking at that cardiovascular system."
"I think I'm fairly comfortable in that I would always have my recommendations about, you know, someone should be on aspirin, they should beta blocked with a cardio selective beta blocker. I would always have my own opinion, so I'd be fairly happy doing it. I think in practice we tend to leave it for Primary Care, plus or minus cardiology."
"Not necessarily, because I think you can generally treat the two separate, I'm not convinced that one treatment is going to nullify the other. I guess we know that beta blockers are relatively safe in COPD so I think you are addressing what each system needs really. So whatever the COPD need is, you address that. If there's a cardiovascular need, that will get addressed as well, so I don't think there's any competing interest or conflicts there."
"Off the top of my head, no I don't think so."
"Yeah so I think firstly is are there any modifiable risk factors such as stopping smoking et cetera. Generally trying to improve fitness in terms of rehabilitation, whether that's a cardiac program or respiratory, so those are two things. In terms of medication, I think you're looking for any evidence of systemic inflammation or exacerbations, because we know that those are now great events in terms of prognosis, both in the COPD world and the cardiac world. So you're looking for, as I said, exacerbations, possibly raised blood eosinophils despite treatment, any evidence of systemic inflammation that you think you can help with really."
"Treatment choice I think in terms of a COPD patient who's having exacerbations, with cardiac history, I'd be more keen for them to be on a, probably, an inhaled steroid probably at that point in the combination of a triple inhaler. Or at least certainly LABA-ICS."
"I think it could, I think it could, I think the evidence for reduction in cardiovascular events with triple inhalers is fairly strong, so I think my threshold for starting a triple inhaler is relatively low in someone that has got that cardiovascular risk profile."
"That's a very good question, I'm not necessarily sure if you can say that, because exacerbations are multi factorial, so some of them will be bacterial infection, viral infection. And whether you've got cardiovascular disease or not, I'm not sure that's going to change your exacerbations, so I think it's not necessarily the presence of cardiac disease that impacts on COPD exacerbation frequency, I think that will be influenced by other things."
"Yeah, I think if you've got risk factors it's a question of, do they have any symptom to suggest overt disease, so are they getting any chest tightness on exertion et cetera. So you're looking for any existing end organ damage I guess."
"So for example, if a patient is breathless, and originally the referral to cardiology was saying, is it a cardiac cause? And cardiology say no, it's likely to be a lung cause, they sometimes point them in our direction to do full lung function tests and diagnose any underlying airways disease, so that's certainly one. I think sometimes they will find coincidentally that this patient's got airways disease and want them managed optimally. So yes occasionally we do get some referrals from cardiology."
"Well firstly I think you've got shared risk factors, so people with heart disease and with COPD can be smokers. You probably have some sort of inherent susceptibility to disease, so not all smokers get COPD, not all people who smoke will get heart disease, so some people will have more susceptibility to develop disease, and I suspect that if you have susceptibility for one that you have susceptibility to other. So for example if a smoker gets COPD I think they are possibly more likely to get heart disease, so I think you do have some commonality between the two."
"Well certainly we know the principle behind COPD is this exaggerated inflammatory response that is mainly in the lung but we think you get systemic inflammation as well. And obviously that can affect other organ systems, one of them being the heart. We know it can cause things like metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, change your lipid profile or cholesterol profile, that kind of thing, so I think that over spill of inflammation then can affect the cardiovascular system."
Yeah so if you can reduce systemic inflammation and exacerbations potentially where there are these peaks in inflammation then you may be able to improve the inflammation to the heart and potential coronary events.
"Well that's the tricky question because I'm not aware of cardiovascular disease resulting in systemic inflammation. I think if you ... what we do know is if you looked at a lot of people with cardiovascular mortality there would probably be a lot of undiagnosed COPD there. So I think what I would say is, the two are going to be found together, so I think certainly there's probably more people out there with COPD out there that we don't know of, that ... and I think screening people with cardiovascular disease would be a good start to look for them."
"Good question. Firstly it depends on if you've got a cardiovascular patient, and you get them to stop smoking, and you get them to do rehabilitation then, I think automatically you're going to have improved lung outcomes. In terms of ... I mean the golden question I guess is the inflammatory thing. If you've got well controlled ischemic heart disease, does that in somehow ... would it affect for example decline in lung function or something like that, and I guess that's what we don't know."
"I guess if you've got someone who is say less mobile, because of ischemic heart disease, then yes they could de-condition, and make COPD worse, so if someone has ... yeah I guess potentially if you have a spike of inflammation that's associated with coronary disease then yes you may get worsening inflammatory response from a respiratory point of view, so potentially."
"No one that I can think of in terms of their name or anything, but I think-"
"Yeah almost certainly we patients that are not well managed from a COPD perspective who I suspect it is affecting their cardiovascular outcomes. So I think there will be some that will have, whether it's worsening ischemic heart disease or even MI down the line, I think it's very hard because we don't see them necessarily long term, to put two and two together, but I think almost certainly that's the case."
"Okay it's doing something, loading up something."
Yep I can see cardiac and cancer rated deaths.
"So current cancer rated deaths, substantial proportion of reported cause of death ... so people who die with COPD, so you've got cardiac related, cancer, respiratory, other, so ... and then different studies. Some large, they're all quite large actually. Yep okay, yep."
"Yeah well it's surprising how different these studies are, in terms of the bars, but what you can see is that there are a significant amount of COPD patients that die of non respiratory causes, whether that's cancer or cardiovascular or something else. So that's number one."
"I think it fits very well, that we know a lot of our COPD patients will have cardiovascular events, a lot of them unfortunately will be diagnosed with lung cancer, which the outcomes are not great for, so this doesn't surprise me in any way really."
It's quite high. It's quite a high figure. Again I don't think it's entirely surprising but it's high.
"I think we probably need to be targeting these patients a bit earlier, and a little bit more aggressively in terms of getting anti-inflammatory medication on board for those that are at risk of this, so particularly the more severe people, A, with known comorbidity or B, having high exacerbations."
"Well I think that's what the hypothesis is, is that this excessive cardiovascular mortality is contributed to by some of the inflammation that we see in COPD."
"Yeah my screen just went blank for a second, it's okay it's fine."
"Yeah, I've just done that, I've just done that."
"Yeah I've got that. Have two times greater risk having cardiovascular disease than those without. Yep. Increased risk of mortality, ischemic heart disease, yep, heart, yep, condition alone ... hang on a sec, I'm trying to work this out. So you've got COPD alone, and you've got versus coronary ... increased risk of mortality ... than those without COPD. A little bit confused on this, so you've got ischemic heart disease and COPD, but then you've got ischemic heart disease and COPD, so ... oh that's with ..."
"... sorry that's, how can that be? How can you have a condition alone, it says COPD?"
"Fine. I'm just wondering why it's so different, then."
"Um ... I'm not sure actually because I would have thought if you have got both, but then I guess if you've got COPD or ... are you treated? I don't know. Certainly if you have both I would have thought your mortality would be roughly the same, if you've got both. I must be missing something here."
"Yep. So ischemic heart disease and COPD versus COPD alone. Yep. So in other words it's saying that cardiovascular mortality is, if you add COPD to it, it's not a huge difference, whereas if you've got COPD by itself, COPD alone, so in other words COPD mortality by itself is not a huge mortality, but when if you add ischemic heart disease it's significantly more, is that right?"
"Increased risk of mortality. What's these? Plus COPD ... I'm not sure, if you've got COPD alone then you add heart disease ... not sure, I'm not sure."
"Increased risk of mortality with COPD alone, cardiovascular alone ... yeah I'm just a little bit confused, it might be just me. I kind of know what you're trying to say, but I'm just struggling to put it into words I guess."
"Well in that ... if you've got COPD and then you get ischemic heart disease on top of it, then it's quite a high mortality."
"But I'm still struggling to see the difference between the two columns, because both of them have ischemic heart disease, both of them COPD, so I'm missing something here."
"So on the left the predominant condition is COPD, is that right?"
"So COPD. And then you add ischemic heart disease, which ... okay well you develop  inaudible 00:33:31  worse. And then on the right you've already got the ischemic heart disease and then you diagnose COPD. Hmm. Why is that though? Let's think about that. If you have COPD, so COPD ... but if you've got ischemic heart disease, you've got ischemic heart disease. Why would there be-"
"Yeah, but again thought, but each column is the same disease, you've got COPD and ischemic heart disease, so I'm struggling to get my head around why one is so much worse than the other. "
"I guess one thing is, if you've COPD then you're not necessarily on treatment for ... so the ischemic heart disease in that column, is that saying that they're untreated for ischemic heart disease?"
"Okay, they later ... but then they're on treatment, where ischemic heart disease, so maybe on the right you don't have that inflammatory response added in from COPD because it's later, whereas on the left you've got the COPD with unchecked inflammatory response, then you diagnosed it, so in other words you're getting some sort of anti-coronary effect before ischemic heart disease is diagnosed, and then it's maybe too late. So that would kind of make sense."
"Okay so basically days following an exacerbation you've got the risk of MI, so you've got stroke and that, so increased risk of MI is doubling really in those first ... and stroke there's a sort of half increase in even six to 10 days, that is preserved, in fact stroke goes up a little bit later, and there's till cardiovascular risk, so in other words after an exacerbation you have significant both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. "
"Yeah I mean that's very interesting, why you've got that difference. I'm not sure why, because they're both due to almost the same etiology, so why you've got one system slightly different and delayed to another I'm not sure. I would expect normally to be pretty similar I would have thought."
"Yeah, moderate means they weren't hospitalized but they took treatment. So if you looked at this in severe exacerbations you might even see more, higher figures really."
"Well it goes with that that from even ... or most exacerbations then are probably have some increase in systemic inflammation. So just for the fact that they're not hospitalized doesn't mean they haven't got inflammation, so I think it just highlights that even moderate exacerbations we should be giving them due attention, not just hospital admissions."
"I think it just highlights more about looking not just at hospitalization but moderate exacerbations as well, so in other words use of rescue packs, how often are they taking steroids or antibiotics."
"Yep, again so LABA-LAMA, you can see Kaplan-Meier, you've mortality there, and then obviously with product X it's lower than LABA-LAMA, but it's also lower than ICS-LABA as well. So obviously that's what we know with triple therapy, that there is this ... we are seeing  inaudible 00:38:18  reduction in mortality. So that fits in with what we know about triple therapy."
"I think what it is is that triple therapy ... reduction in mortality but even more than just ICS-LABA, so it's not just necessarily the inhaled steroid, it's a combination of all three. Whether that is linked because there's overall reduction in exacerbations compared with triple against dual. I suspect it's something related to that."
"I think it all depends on the study, the number of patients, so does it say the number of patients on this slide? I guess for this kind of thing it would depend on how big the study is and does it meet ... let's have a look. So non-significant ... so it's a non-significant  inaudible 00:39:15 . So it doesn't meet statistical significance against ICS-LABA. I suspect it might against LABA-LAMA. But looking at those figures, although this reduction doesn't make statistical significance, so I guess the thing there is, someone who exacerbates they might benefit from LABA-ICS, and not necessarily need the triple therapy."
"Yep, so let's have a look. Reduction in mortality against LABA-LAMA, that's what we'd expect, statistical significance, so that's a given. Yeah that's again comparison to LAMA-LABA, so I don't think there's any ... but what I'm suggesting is it's ... is it just the inhaled steroid? Or is it the fact that there's a triple therapy, there's some sort of synergistic effect? Because we know about certainly exacerbation reduction is higher with triple against dual. So in other words ICS-LABA I'd expect lower exacerbations with ICS-LABA-LAMA than ICS-LABA. So I think what we see here is certainly a lot of this is going to be I suspect the ICS element to it, but I guess it's more of a question of, is it triple therapy against ICS-LABA, is there much more of a difference there?"
"Well I think again, it just reinforces the link between mortality and potential reduction if you're using an inhaled steroid."
"Well I think what it says here is that although product X is better mortality it doesn't meet statistical significance in this study, but what I don't know is how big this is, how many patients, what the power is. So it could be that it's just a small study so you'd probably want to know in a well powered large study is there a difference between a triple against ICS-LABA."
"So I presume that is meaning you have to treat 80 patients with triple to reduce one death, compared to someone on LABA-LAMA, is that right?"
I think it probably is in line with what I'd expect.
"Yeah, difficult to know because 80 ... just wondering, that's quite high. For me to change LAMA-LABA to let's say a triple, how many would I need? 50 ... 80, 80's quite high. But then is it? 80 people to save one life. No maybe it's quite a reasonable figure actually, because at the end of the day it's mortality, it's just inhaler that's different. And that's 80, so for every 80 patients, yeah so I think that stacks up quite a lot, so yes I think that is quite a decent number."
"Yeah okay, so we've got product X, so again this is where it's interesting because if we look on the left, combined cardiovascular mortality, your triple is actually slightly higher than your ICS-LABA, which is interesting so it reinforces this point that between triple and ICS-LABA there may not be too much difference, and you see that with non-fatal MI as well, they're almost exactly the same. If anything non-fatal stroke is higher with product X, and then similar with coronary vascular. So I think what this shows is generally ICS containing components there tends to be benefit which is similar, so certainly I don't think you can necessarily say from this that product X is significantly better than ICS-LABA. And then on the right summary of end of treatment deaths, so all cause  inaudible 00:44:33  28, so as a percentage  inaudible 00:44:39  on and off treatment deaths. So lower overall cardiovascular, again ICS-LABA similar to product X, and then pneumonia risk similar. So yeah again not a huge difference between triple and ICS-LABA."
"So respiratory hardly any difference. So it's interesting because ... yeah it's cause of death, isn't it? So what it doesn't tell you is anything about exacerbations, that's separately, so what it's saying is  inaudible 00:45:33  the majority of the benefit is for the cardiovascular outcome as opposed to respiratory mortality."
"Interesting. I guess it's a new area isn't it? We've never really thought about this before, that a lot of the benefit of a respiratory drug might actually be on cardiovascular outcomes, so I guess this is big news us, it might be even bigger news for cardiologists really, it's just a whole, if you like, new way of thinking, that all of sudden respiratory physicians are really closet cardiologists because we've got an intervention, a respiratory intervention that can actually do a lot of good, so we might have a tool up our sleeves that's a lot more powerful than cardiologists have got."
"I think it's certainly interesting, and I think it's very relevant and at the end of the day, it's mortality which is an important outcome, so I think it's very relevant."
"I think it does, I guess the next thing is though is then reinforcing where we are with inhaled steroids and some of the problems the side effects we see, and trying to get that risk balance right you know, because we're potentially ... we've always had this issue about inhaled steroids and COPD, what's good, what's bad. Now this is swinging the pendulum towards them, we just need to make sure that ... where do we stand in terms of from the negative aspects of inhaled steroids really. So if you look at pneumonia risk here, it's very, not a huge difference necessarily between the steroid component and the non-steroid component. "
"I think that's fair enough yeah, I think that's fair."
"Okay, so product X showed a reduction in cardiovascular  inaudible 00:48:16  LABA-LAMA. So again this is statistically significant against LABA-LAMA, so again it's comparing against LAMA-LABA which I think we would know that yes it's going to do that. So yeah, so 62% reduction is obviously quite large, and it's statistically significant so yep, very relevant."
"I'm not sure it does, because I think the previous slide, I already got that impression that there's a significant difference between product X and LABA-LAMA. "
Well it looks as though that is true already isn't it? That triple therapy seems to be reducing cardio ... coronary deaths. So I think the proof is there already.
"Yeah. Okay, what's ARR? Absolute risk reduction, okay, so  inaudible 00:50:19  single inhaler therapy  inaudible 00:50:21 , so again so we've got, okay, so estimated annualized AR, so what this is is statins, we've got ACE inhibitors, and then you've got two with ICS, so basically triples against LABA-LAMA."
"Yeah, so significant reduction compared to others,  inaudible 00:50:50  placebo control, so it's suggesting that this is a very significant intervention in the sort of story of reducing cardiovascular risk."
"How important optimization with COPD medication is, in people with potential coronary risk. "
"Point three, point three, point eight. What's an SGL2 inhibitor?"
"  00:51:30  glucose co-transporter, I don't think I've heard of that."
"Ah okay, I think I know the one, yeah. Yes I think I do know what you're talking about. That's fine. Statins point six. So yeah I mean, this is interesting isn't it? The traditional things, what is not on here beta blocker, be interesting to know what beta blocker was, but certainly if you think about it, statins, ACE inhibitors, these are household names when it comes to coronary risk reduction, and you've now got triple therapy that beats this quite considerably. So yeah I think this is very significant."
"Because then, beta blocker is known to reduce coronary risk, and if you asked say a cardiologist what's the one drug that you could reduce coronary risk with, I think they would say beta blocker. And it would be interesting to know would that be a much bigger effect than triple therapy, just to quantify where triple therapy stands, because you never know, triple therapy could be the best thing to reduce coronary risk that's ever occurred, so it would be nice to know where a beta blocker stands."
"So ... it seems to be more than product Y, I don't know what the difference is, product X and Y is, but ... point  inaudible 00:53:08 , but certainly it seems to be highly effective, product X, at reducing cardiovascular mortality."
"Could be the kind of inhaled steroid that you're using, potentially could be drug delivery, so those are the two things that I think of. So the molecule and the mechanism of delivery of that molecule."
"Well there seems to be a difference there, I'd want to know more about why there is a such a big difference between the two. In terms of the studies are they similar studies? Are the demographics the same? Patients? That sort of stuff, I'm assuming they are."
"Well I think the data's quite compelling, that it does seem that yes, these triple inhalers can reduce the mortality."
"I think we got the first hint of this in probably the TORCH study, where was a potential benefit with ICS-LABA in terms of mortality reduction, so I think that's the first time we heard of this, and then I think newer studies I think particularly with the triples have shown this to be more significant. So I think it is a relatively new message, that's sort of getting louder and louder, and I think we do need to take more consideration of it."
"I think it's brought to light that anyone that potentially has ischemic heart disease or at risk, we should be making sure ... do they warrant triple therapy? Certainly being very aggressive with anyone with even moderate exacerbations, I think it's lowered the threshold for triple inhalers."
"I guess it's just strengthened the link that we already knew that there probably was a link, but it's good to see that this treatment for one condition has such an impact on another system. So I think we have to think more closely about the two more than we probably traditionally have done."
"I think that the Kaplan-Meier plot was quite convincing. I think looking at these trials with triple therapy compared to some of the household names in cardiovascular reductions, like ACE inhibitors, statins, that's very compelling as well, that this is such a big impact compared to what historically we've known about. So yeah, I'd be quite interested in what cardiologists think of this data actually."
"Yeah I guess it's a question of, right have they got ischemic heart disease? Have they got risk factors for it? Certainly if someone has got ischemic heart disease, you'd want to know how stable it is, it just might reduce your threshold for  inaudible 00:57:21  obviously guidelines say it's because of increasing breathlessness, symptoms or exacerbations now. I guess the question's now in someone that's ... their breathlessness is say controlled, they're not having exacerbations, but if they have got ischemic heart disease and they're not on triple therapy, do you now start them on triple therapy? And I guess that is what we ... we probably looked at guidelines to guide us on that, I don't think the guidelines at the moment would suggest that. Obviously this data is quite compelling to suggest that maybe we should. In other words should almost be preventing cardiovascular mortality before it happens, should we be ... if that kind of makes sense."
Well I think the data you've already shown but now I'd be expecting national bodies to be looking at this data and then advising us accordingly.
"Well I think we will always have a duty to do what's right for the patient, so I think we would now be looking for guidance suggesting that it's something that we should be more proactive in, because at the moment our guidance suggests ... nowhere in our guidance does it suggest you should be doing any sort of cardiovascular risk assessment and starting triple therapy because of that. The guidance is suggesting, because of uncontrolled breathlessness or exacerbations, so I'd be wanting to hear from NICE or BTS guidelines about, right now you should be doing it for this reason as well."
"Yeah, it'd be interesting to see, because they all have their guidelines, but ultimately these are potentially respiratory patients who we see in a respiratory environment, I'd expect respiratory guidelines to guide us on where we should be using really."
"No problem, thank you very much, take care."
"So I'm a respiratory consultant, the lead for the COPD at my site. I work in secondary care and I work in a hospital which is a big teaching hospital. Biggest trust in the UK."
"In terms of the way I prescribe it to a patient, did you say, or...?"
"Right. So, I suppose it's all driven realistically by exacerbation rates. So, steroid causes, number of exacerbation, hospital admissions is what drives me to prescribe a triple or dual benefit."
"Well, severe, from my perspective, would be someone who's been hospitalized, who requires inpatient treatment. Moderate exacerbation will be someone who just maybe requires a steroid cause, but not necessarily  inaudible 00:03:40 ."
"If I was going to go straight to triple, I mean, I tend not to go to straight triple unless we've got someone with a confirmed diagnosis of COPD who already been with a current exacerbator with multiple courses of steroids and hospital admissions, then you might go straight to a triple in that case, in the unlikely event that patient isn't on any previous medication. So, realistically, I mean, if we use GOLD guidelines and we're based in the UK, so we use what  inaudible 00:04:22  tell us, we use what GOLD tells us. So, from that perspective, if I've got a patient who just breathless with underlying COPD, then generally speaking, it would be LAMA LABA therapy or LABA ICS therapy if I thought they had the eosinophilic phenotype, which might respond better to steroids. But for me to go to straight to a triple, it would have to be someone who was quite severe in terms of number of exacerbations and courses of steroids."
"So, I mean, here in the UK, there's three therapies. Two of them, which we've used quite for a long period of time. And then there's a new therapy which has come onto the horizon, which people are just starting to use now. So, from my perspective, we've got Trimbow and Trelegy which have been tried and tested, and we get lots of data around those and decision making around which ones we use is really dependent upon the patient we have in front of us. So, if you've got a patient, for example, who is good, good manual therapy, no major issues, good  inaudible 00:05:40  as well, then generally speaking, we might go with  inaudible 00:05:44  and work our way up in terms the therapies."
"If you've got someone who's got issues around his spirit as well for example, or you might go with Trimbow with his fate, so just to try and negate that issue from that side of things. Then you've got Trixeo which is coming new onto the horizon and if I'm completely honest, we're starting to see a little bit of it, but we've not necessarily gone full boom in terms of its treatment. But I know it's a triple, I know that there's good evidence based around it, I know that there's evidence around it in terms of... If you've got patient errors in terms of its administration, it's still got very good efficacy. So we are using-"
"Well, I mean, the thing is you can go through a hundred different trials. You could go for trial start and multiple, multiple trials. ICS LABA is that these triples  inaudible 00:06:57 -"
"So, the thing is, from my perspective, the triples have all got their pros and cons. We're very experienced in using triples in terms of the other two. Trixeo is new onto the horizon, we've had medical scientists and-"
"  00:07:42  You're not actually giving me an opportunity to come on it, you continue to cut off."
"You know, you're not really giving me an opportunity to explain that situation, you're continuing to come in on that situation. Our exposure to Trixeo is not a huge amount so far. Generally speaking, it's the newer inhaler, it was only launched a few months ago. So, if you're asking me have I looked at the literature, of course I've looked at the literature.  inaudible 00:08:06  So, of course it's got efficacy otherwise it wouldn't have been launched. But if you are asking me what my opinion of that is, is that if you look at the data across all these trials, no matter which trial you're looking at, which medication, of course it's got good efficacy."
"And we know that it's a triple. It's a triple option from going from Symbicort inhaler up to a triple in COPD. If you can ask me around, well, does it help in terms of severe exacerbations? Of course, it does because the data reflects that. But I'm trying to explain this to situation. Of course, it's got good efficacy but can I compare it to the other two? Well, there's no head to head trials against any of these inhalers, there's no head to head against any of the triples."
"Obviously, a few things really. One is reduction in hospitalization, so that's the big one, generally speaking. And I think the other... Obviously we've got reduction  inaudible 00:13:55 , severe exacerbations when you compare it to LAMA LABA. And the overall big one for me is obviously all cause mortality has a significant impact on that. And the say point really is that this triple is, as I've listed it here, it's a triple, which is proven to reduce hospitalization. So, that's quite impactful then."
"I think that it's impactful specific to use because realistically, if this is the only study which is shown to reduce hospitalization, then that's quite impactful towards Trixeo over the others."
"I'd say that realistically, maybe a little bit earlier. Yeah, maybe a little bit earlier."
"From my perspective, would be that borderline patient who's on the costs of high symptomatology type of patient, highly affected by it, but not necessarily meeting the overall criteria for you to be thinking of going to a triple in terms of... I mean, here where we are in the UK, we tend to follow GOLD guidance in terms of what GOLD tells us in terms of exacerbation rates and hospital admission. But it might be just that step before that and you've got someone who's highly symptomatic and then you might initiate that triple therapy to try and really reduce the chances of hospitalization in these patients."
"It does. It does. It does, because, the whole idea behind this is, you don't want hospitalization to occur. So, it's not based just on the fact that someone's been hospitalized, it's actually... you are hoping that they don't get to that stage. So, it definitely makes you think about using it earlier."
"Well, I mean, realistically, the push is always about try to reduce exacerbations and also try to reduce hospitalization. I suppose, the slant on this is slightly different in the fact that the other products are basically talking about, we want to reduce hospital admissions, we want reduce exacerbation. But what this is realistically doing is basically telling you that this is a product whereby proven to reduce that hospitalization. It's a slightly different slant really, it's almost aiming towards an earlier intervention to prevent that hospitalization rather than reducing the overall number of hospitalizations."
"I mean, I suppose it's the same thing when you get representatives from Trelegy or Trimbow or whatever it might be. The take on it is always to try and reduce the number of hospitalizations and I've never seen them come with a slant that they actually... This is a product which is proven to actually prevent that hospitalization so that... The slant is different, I suppose."
"Well, I think that would be very high. I'll give it a six."
"I'd say, I'll probably go for the same thing actually, because it's just slightly different compared to the others."
"I think pretty much what it says in the slide right at the top,  inaudible 00:20:40  that the emphasis is, one is exacerbation. It's pretty much what it tells me right at the top, the title pretty much explains what's going on there."
"It breaks it down a bit more, I think. It breaks it down, I think that's quite helpful actually, for people to be able to see that it's just not a single organ which is being affected by all this. So I think this one compared to the other one."
Other chest physicians and I suppose the way you might explain it to the patient to whom you're going to prescribe this.
"My assumption is really is that the COPD exacerbation is going to lead to all these other bundles of things going down there and the overall effects on mortality at the bottom. So yeah, I get it, but I suppose it makes its point. I won't really say anything beyond that, to be honest with you. I think sometimes simplistic views are good views and I think it makes it  inaudible 00:22:50  realistically. So whether I prefer it, I think I prefer the other slide compared to this one, but still, I get what it's getting up basically."
"It's less word busy, isn't it? And it's more diagrammatic, so I get that it's pretty much trying to value the same thing, but just in a more simple version."
"I suppose it's just giving you a little bit more... The explanations are a little bit more dead in terms of philosophicalization. One in five die, just giving you a little bit more clarity on each of those sections, but I think it is the same message all the way through, for all these slides. It's just the way that they worded things slightly the differently."
"And so I think that this is quite straightforward, I don't think it's overdone in terms of the wording, but I don't think it's anything different than what the other ones have done, what the other ones have said really."
I feel it's an improvement on the original.
And that's a definite improvement on the original.
"I suppose this LTUD, I think that's sort of grown on me a little bit if I'm honest."
"Yeah, I'll still probably go for UC.   00:25:52 "
"It's an improvement on the original, yeah."
So I suppose that I'm going to stick to my guns on this and I'm going to go with LTUC.
I suppose I'm going to stick to my guns on this a little bit and I'm going to go with what I went with last time round. I don't think that at all.
"I can't remember whether there was any specific part in any of those where it did talk about purely the only one which makes a difference in terms of hospitalization. But I think the fact that's not stuck out to me, I think I'm still going to stick to my guns and go with the same option again."
"I mean, it's just you got 52% reduction versus LAMA LABA, so I think that for me, the fact that it just significantly reduces moderate to severe exacerbation by 52%, that's just quite impactful and it's just straightforward. I don't think it's always gone in any shape, way or form, so that in itself will have a huge impact."
"This is a little bit more, I suppose. It's still giving me the same message about 53%  inaudible 00:28:55  exacerbation, but then on the right hand side, it goes back to the fact that you want to prevent one exacerbation for every three patients treated with Trimbow. So, I think it just gives you a little bit more compared to the other one."
"I suppose it just puts it in context a little bit, doesn't it? I mean, the percentage usually... Yeah 52% looks great, but that one in three just puts it into a little bit more context. So I quite like that to be honest with you."
"I think that focuses your mindset, it's almost like differentiating them against the other triples. I think the other slide, very good in terms of 52% reduction but I think this one points towards this in particular."
"So an improvement on the original on that one. So EA, part of what we've just seen last then. Was that the last one?"
"So, I think from my perspective, I think that I'm going to go with the one in three, one in five, the one which I'm going to get off of all of these."
"I think I would stick with the same, yep."
"I think I will go with the same again, because I think that's the one which really, as far as I'm concerned, it really hammers home on that one."
"Yeah. You see, I suppose... Is that the tricky one isn't it, because you've got only 50, you've got only in Trixeo in there and that your difference, that's-"
"If we're talking about differentiation from other  inaudible 00:33:01  therapies, you're right, I'll probably switch that one background. I would go with the only Trixeo on that one."
"Okay again, very simplistic and there's not much to ride home about other than again, I suppose this one is telling you only Trixeo is significant reduced hospitalization. And I think from the offset, this slide itself, you're telling me that this is what this product does differently compared to your other products, and then you've obviously got your 20% reduction as well."
"On the Trixeo, yeah. Same again, I suppose but with just a little bit more information at the bottom there with that one COPD hospitalization  inaudible 00:34:20  one patient treated. So again, it just adds a little bit to the scenario, a little bit more than the previous one. But again, it's very much focused it's only Trixeo again. So the emphasis is very much... It's different to your other products."
"Yeah, I suppose, it's putting it in context, isn't it really? So on the previous one, all that was a slightly different one on it, and we're talking about one in three, et cetera, but this one, one third, fair enough, it's having an impact. If you're telling me, is that going to change my mindset around it? Probably not. But the overall factor is that it's reducing hospitalizations quite considerably. So, I suppose it's more additive rather than it's not going to influence what I do overall just based upon that one line at the bottom there."
"Yeah, I like this, actually. I quite like this. Again, I don't think it's overdone and it's quite clear that you've got a LAMA LABA versus the LABA ICS and what it's doing with Trixeo and an addition. And the fact that it says only Trixeo at top again, it's pointing towards the fact that this is the differentiating factor. So I quite like, that slide actually."
"Protection against COPD on the Trixeo,  inaudible 00:36:27 . It's just, I know you were saying don't go in to it visually, but it's a little bit busy for me visually, to be honest with you. I think you get the same cold points, but I mean, it's telling you what it's telling, really.  inaudible 00:36:49  at 20% and the fact that if you use Trixeo versus  inaudible 00:36:57  hospitalization. So, I think it's straightforward, I don't think there's anything to it other than that. And again, the emphasis is around Trixeo being the only one again."
"I mean, the previous one showed it was a just slightly different slide, but you got the gist of around what was going on in terms of the LAMA LABA and LABA ICS up until the triples and from my perspective, I don't think it adds much more than what I've seen on the previous slide if I want it."
I think you do because that was missed by me to an extent.
"It does. It does, doesn't it? Because really, we're always looking for real will type of data and I think that's quite impactful. It should obvious that I've missed that in the midst of that."
"I'm going to, based upon what you've just said Dan, and the fact that we've gone through that, I will go with HC as my number one in that situation."
"So, in second place for me  inaudible 00:41:11  what it says, only Trixeo reduced the hospitalization versus  inaudible 00:41:13  that one, yeah."
And then it'll be the other one because they significantly prevent CLP hospitalization on Trixeo.
I would follow state passion on all these.
And I don't think there's any other differentiator in market advantages compared to the last one.
"Again, it's  inaudible 00:42:15  49% reduction. So, I think the second line at the top pretty much explains what's going on there. But I think that the bit of the bottom was obviously... Put that into context. And fact that it says for every 80 patients that treated  inaudible 00:42:30  with LAMA LABA, one that can be prevented. I think that's quite impactful to be honest with you as well. So I think it's self explanatory. I don't think it's too difficult to understand what's going on there."
I'm not too sure if they make a difference with you.  inaudible 00:43:09 
"I suppose it just personalizes it a little more doesn't it? So I suppose it hits home a little bit more. I think it just personalized it and hits home a little bit more, more impactful."
"So sorry, can you flip back to that last slide for me once more please?"
Okay. And go back to the first one again.
"Right, okay. Yeah, so if you go back to that-"
"So I suppose, it's the fact that you've got only Trixeo on the top, which differentiates it compared to the previous ones."
"It changes it, not it a little bit because actually... Okay, I suppose it's making a differentiating factor around why you would prescribe this over the other potential triples, so it actually emphasizes that point. I think the others sort of give you the same message around reduction of grace and stuff and depth and how impactful that is. But this is actually telling you that this is your trip deal, which does this, so it's slightly different."
"I think it just goes into a little bit more detail there. Isn't it really around it? So it would add... I suppose it depends on what question... If you're asking me, would this make me prescribe this product more compared to the previous slide?"
"Okay. That's fine. So as an addition, that would be fine. Yeah, I think it gives you a little bit more compared to the previous one."
"Just because I suppose it's breaking it down more from that perspective, the emphasis is there more when you look at it. The information is more there with regards that... Suppose it's a bit more focused than your  inaudible 00:47:42 ."
"I suppose it just adds more context to that doesn't it, I think? It just adds more context and it just emphasizes the point more with regards to Trixeo over the LAMA LABA situation. So, I think it just adds more context to it if I'm honest."
"Well,  inaudible 00:48:40  perception studies. So UK perception studies, I've got a familiarity with that."
" inaudible 00:48:44  studies, not so much. Scandinavian  inaudible 00:48:53  I've heard about it, come across it, hopefully not so much. So a little bit familiarity."
"I couldn't hear. I think you guys couldn't hear me or I couldn't hear you guys, just went completely blank."
"Well, you're talking about bringing the other slide onto this page."
"I suppose, simplicity is the key, isn't it realistically? Just puts it in context, very simple. But being to understand it's really important now."
"This is a tricky one. I found this most difficult out of all of it, because I think I'm going to go to the same one all the way through because I think I can't split them to be honest. So I'm going to go with every life save matters to their loved ones."
"Yeah, I suppose the only bit which I would actually change any of those would be the differentiation from other cultural benefits, I would put only Trixeo before the other one on that one."
"So I've got an icon over at the top right here, which you can't remove. So just looking at it, it says, ""Did you know that one in two exacerbations go unreported."" I think that's what it says."
"""And fortunately the Trixeo is proven to being exacerbations regardless of what your"" And I don't see what the rest of that-"
"Okay. Right. It  inaudible 00:00:56:21  exacerbations regardless of  inaudible 00:56:25  Okay. On reduced preventive exacerbations versus LAMA LABA. So, we've got that exacerbation reduction, we're not driven  inaudible 00:56:34  history. Okay."
"I suppose the second line and the bottom line is pretty much the take on point. So, reduction in exacerbation regardless of patients perception of that, and actually protection against exacerbations with cloudless of the exacerbation history to take away from that."
"Well, I suppose the data is reflecting that is the case, so yeah."
"Of course, because it changes your slant because it's always been about exacerbation that certain number of exacerbations consider instituted a triple if it exacerbates, but actually this is telling you a slightly different slant. What it's telling you is that you don't necessarily have to exacerbate it, but actually if you institute this triple in a patient, who's not necessarily exacerbated previously, you're going to reduce the chances of these patients having an exacerbation. So the different slant to what we've been taught previously."
"So are you saying to me, am I more likely to prescribe Trixeo to a patient, which I would never have prescribed triple  inaudible 00:58:57 ? Is that the question?"
"We do, because we have lots of patients who, I suppose, have got significant underlying airway's disease with COPD. We've got a baseline level  inaudible 00:59:35  who might not necessarily meet your overall criteria of what you thought your overall criteria was for a triple previously. So, definitely where you would institute this, which you haven't done previously."
"I suppose the fact that it's just given a little bit more context, isn't it? So if in Kronos, you've got three out of four patients, if you not having an exacerbation. So it was just putting it into context that actually, this is a medication which you can use in a group of patients, which are not necessarily exacerbating, but you can reduce their risk of exacerbation. So I think it adds, there's a little bit more to it than the previous slide."
Are we assuming that this slide here is broken down to two sections? Is that what you getting at? Which one would I add or are you talking about the previous-
Let me have a look. Go back to the one again.
"But I suppose it's that little pie chart area, which you would put it in as an addition."
"Because the context it provides is slightly different than the previous one. And what you've got on here is relatively similar type of information, particularly on the right hand side. You've got that on the third side anyway, but it just says three out four patients who didn't have an exacerbation. It just provides a different mindset when you look at that. So, I think that would be in an addition to what you've got previous."
"To the disorder, which we've just gone there."
"I think it increases the urgency to treat, it does."
"I think increasing the urgency to treat it does because we've changed the slant around only Trixeo etc. So from my perspective, I'd have to go higher than what I did last time now."
" Inaudible 01:06:07  So, it motivates me to prescribe Trixeo. I mean, I pull together the slide which I think is the best, so I'm going to have to score higher than what I did last time now, otherwise I haven't done a very good job there. So  inaudible 01:06:20  so, I think that was definitely."
"So, what I would say is that I suppose as cheesy as it sounds, you'd say, well, it's only Trixeo which is been proven to reduce your hospitalization, so that's your first one. And I think the biggest one for me would be that this is an early initiation of a triple benefit to reduce hospital admissions, irrespective of exacerbation history."
"Yeah, my pleasure, I think I'm connected and online. So I have the screen. I see the screen. It says welcome there. I'm connected over my phone line. Do we need a webcam?"
"I'm an office based pulmonary specialist and allergist, and 100% of my activity is patient care. We also have a sleep lab and other  inaudible 00:02:12  also part of our focus, and I work full time."
"Per month, there will be at least 100 COPD patients."
"So, I'd say our patients, the patients I see are already on a bronchodilator when they come. So they've already had their first time treatment. So it almost never happens that in 10% of cases, I start them on other  inaudible 00:03:07  spray alone. So I usually start them on dual immediately and then we see whether we want to set them up to triple. I have many patients on triple therapy and I try to start without corticosteroids, but with asthma and asthma component or after the first exacerbation, we always switch them on a ICS combination. I have several on fixed combination, so I just switched several patients to a fixed dose triple combination."
"The large measure of my patients do without corticosteroids, maybe... Hang on, so 10 to 20 are single, 50% are on dual therapy and the remaining proportion, this would be 30 to 40% are on triple and a fixed dose is probably 20. I heard her say 20% out of those."
"Now with COVID we don't allow them in. And I think this is true for all offices. So with the pandemic, we can't really allow ourselves to do that, so therefore we strictly reject any visits."
"The inhaled steroids, the benefits of triple therapy, the simplicity of it, the ease of use for patients, that fixed combination also means you do with one device less than you would have to be if you weren't used a fixed dose combination."
"So it's information that we've known that we are familiar with. I mean, I train do COPD trainings, and so this is what I start out with. So COPD is incredibly widespread disease,"
"I mean, I'm shocked that more than 50% of patients with COPD are said to be undiagnosed, and these will be smokers who say, ""Well, I've had my smokers cough for many years."" And so, but I thought these were an exception. I don't think that these 50% or over half of patients is true for Germany. So I don't really think this would probably be the worldwide average. So yeah, maybe that is true at a global scale."
"It is interesting to see, I mean, for our every day work, however, it is more relevant for us to see the local situation. I mean, I can perfectly see how other countries have an even higher incidents in spite of the fact that in Germany, it's already terribly widespread, and here what it says also within three months after severe exacerbation, we have and up to 40% of patients that are readmitted, this is not what I see, this doesn't really reflect my practice."
"So information relevant for my patients, not really for me being a specialist, so three, credibility, five or five to six, and motivation to think differently, no, not really, three, because I already have my pathway, I just really approach when it comes to COPD exacerbations."
"Now this is exactly what I said before didn't I? So it's the Southern region that's crazy, it's crazy isn't it? How widespread it is there?"
"It is a calamity, it is terrifying. I mean, it look in Italy is not really dark, dark, dark, but then if you look at Greece, Southern Greece, or because people smoke they're incredibly lot, but I didn't know that their prevalence, especially in the Southern hemisphere was so much higher than in the Northern hemisphere, and here also in the Southern America, I didn't know they were smoking that much over there, but maybe this is pollution. So Africa, I never expected to have a two, I never expected this incredible COPD prevalence for Africa."
"CPOD smoking. Yeah. I mean, these are the very obvious aspects of smoking. I think they should have make the smoking a little bigger, because this is the major risk factor, smoking has an extra role because this is something the patient would be in control over, and so therefore smoking should be set apart. And then the health related issues yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But then no, no, no fits fine. And also obesity, yes. And I think, I mean, however, I mean there are diagnosis and then there is low physical activity, so in a way, this doesn't seem to fit in the same. How could I put this? In the same cluster."
"Yeah. I mean this incredibly high mortality in regions, I never expected to have this incredibly high amount or prevalence of COPD, South America, I didn't expect this. I mean, Germany is bad, but then Germany look here is doing worse compared to Italy. Would that be right? I mean, in Italy, everyone's smoking is smoker is that... And then Germany is doing worse compared to France at same level with Greece, I'm surprised, I really am surprised. And Africa, I don't expect to see this prevalence spread."
"Okay, look for my daily practice it is not very relevant. I mean, I have my patients, if they come in, I don't make my diagnosis based on where they are from, so it's three, three, three, four, no, three, six, three."
"So we underestimate the exacerbations also here, 50 to 78% of COPD exacerbation are not even reported, I mean, the spiral, the downward spiral is a spiral is very well represented, very clear, I mean, that's not new. But then the other figures incredibly high, again, almost unbelievably high. So at least one moderate or severe exacerbation within a three year period, maybe this is the case. I mean, I would... So they come in every three months and then we ask for exacerbations, and my impression was the exacerbation rate is not as high, but then not everyone is with there pulmonologist, right? I mean they many COPD patient stay with their GP, but it's very interesting to see really."
"Yeah, it really, in a way, it reassures me that I have to keep asking each and every patient for exacerbation for any the exacerbations they've experienced in the past. I mean, this is what we do when I train my people and COPD, this is exactly what we focus on that we say, ""This is a key aspect we have to look into, we have to take into consideration and that we have to try to control."" Here C is more relevant for my practice, this would be a six, credible five because the non-reported cases is very, very high. And then six for motivation."
"Every exacerbation, each exacerbation, irreversibly damages, the patient's health. So they're doing very poorly under exacerbation, but this also explains why they're doing a lot less than before the exacerbation, even after the exacerbation, and this is important at every stage of the disease. Notice, treat the exacerbation, and even in mild COPD, you have a more pronounced look of volume compared to the other levels. So that is what... This is what most specialists do. So you look at the exacerbation specifically in the severe cases, but no, we have to take them very seriously from the beginning on, from the earliest stage on."
"That's right. I mean, yeah, 32 milliliters, not very much in my, I mean, 87 milliliters decline by 87 milliliters, that sounds a lot. I mean, the severe cases, they suffer with every tiny additional loss. And here you notice the lung function loss immediately, but I think it's not only the lung function, it's all of the severe  inaudible 00:17:57  lung function, especially in the severe COPD patients."
"No, because this is exactly what we do. So we try to intensify treatment and this is why they receive oral steroids early on, and we also make sure that we act early on and show early response and also take them in as soon as possible to prevent exactly this."
"Well, this is very relevant, this would be another six, credibility is a five, and motivation is six."
"Yeah. Main message is each exacerbation takes you closer to the end of your life, right? So 50% after more or three or more exacerbations, I mean, this is comparable to tumor masks, right? To lung cancer. I mean, if patients are hospitalized and then if a couple of months after that, again, hospitalized, obviously their survival, probability of survival, at surviving is significantly reduced. He wanted two acute exacerbations. I mean, even an exacerbation is normally it's... This wouldn't be an exception. And then here where it says dead within five years, I don't think that's what I see. But then there's trial data to support these claims. Right? Hmm."
"Yes. I mean, COPD is really my pet issue, so to speak. And I've also worked in rehab of pulmonary rehab, lung rehab, and so this is exactly what we're trying to prevent, this is what our focus is on. And when you give me a product that significantly reduces exacerbations, then this is exactly what we are hoping, that we've been hoping for years for to get. I mean, it's absolutely different. It's not really making me think differently because this is exactly what we've tried, what we've been trying to focus on. I mean, 80% risk of death increase, wow. But yeah, it makes perfect sense. And also here, 21% increase. Mm."
"And I think there should be better media coverage on exacerbation, and this might Help people to stop smoking."
"Oh, it is very relevant six, credible four."
"Very motivating six highly motivating. Yeah. I mean, there is, this is exactly what it is about, we want to help patients and increase their probability of surviving, obviously."
"So this tells us, look at the lungs, but not only at the lungs, there is also the cardiovascular risk stroke, increased risk of MI and stroke, this is exactly what we see. And this is what we do, we are looking at the lungs, we're looking at the heart, just the heart is also in the center of our attention. So yeah."
"Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I'm just seem to be very gullible. Right? But yeah. I mean, sounds, I mean, just from what I see, I think yeah, makes sense, seems to fit."
"Oh, this is another six, credible is four and motivating, yep six."
"Okay. I'm back now, you should hear me again, right? Rosie. So I mean, what she said is, makes perfect sense. What she sees here that obviously COPD patients have a... Are more likely to die from their COPD than from cardiovascular condition. So in the moderate COPD patients, I mean, with every diagnosis, COPD diagnosis, I always refer them to a cardiologist to also take a look at the heart."
"Not that relevant, I'd say five, credibility five, motivation four."
"So at the end of the day, this is what I said before, so we have the same risk factors, shared risk factors, primarily smoking effects, or causes not only COPD, but it'll also damages the vessels because cardiovascular conditions and then the exacerbations intensify just boost, accelerate the whole thing. So, and this absolutely is  choose 00:27:48 , you have atrial fibrillation, then you have heart failure, then you lack of oxygen, and then you have a higher likely your patients have a increased probability of suffering heart  inaudible 00:28:01 . This is exactly the way it's"
Wonderful. I'm so sorry that it's for the inconvenience.
"Yeah. Okay. The rating then, clinical relevance is six, credibility is another six and another six for motivation."
"Yeah, now they're drawing it from The backside. I mean, so exacerbations is a logical setup, then you see they complications and then you have, so if they show you who's supposed the corticosteroid, inhaled corticosteroid. Yeah. So patients with elevated eosinophil counsel makes perfect sense too."
"So the intention here is, so what it conveys is that first of repeated exacerbations, so before exacerbation or after an exacerbation is basically before the exacerbations, so test your patients, look at the eosinophil counts in your patients to just decide whether you want prescribe ICS or not."
"Relevance to six credibility is six, motivation four hasn't really motivated me terribly."
"Exacerbations from different perspectives. This is what I said before, so there is before and after exacerbation basically before is after, and so then you obviously have the shortening, the shorter intervals. And so this is what you see, they shortening the shorter time between exacerbations. Yeah, absolutely. And this is relevant information too."
"No, I means so far I haven't really seen new information to tell you the truth. So I'd say 6, 6, 4 for the ratings."
"So increased symptoms. Yeah. So high severity of COPD, increased breathlessness, increased likelihood of suffering from exacerbations. So there is this correlation and here, we automatically also cover the aspect of quality of life."
"Absolutely. Yeah. And here relevance, I mean, all this information is relevant. So six is relevant, six is credibility and motivation is four. Because this is not new information, this is why it's a four only. Nothing new. I mean, this is information we already have, this is exactly what we take into consideration to treat our patients."
"Exacerbation irrespective of the eosinophil count. So this is again, the focus on the ICS to reduce exacerbations. So usually you have increased exacerbations depending on the elevated, or in the blood eosinophil levels, but here what you have with ICS, even in these cases, you would be able to prevent exacerbations."
"No, not really, because elevated eosinophil count patients already, no. So they receive, I've already prescribe ICS containing treatment and then, but then I'm also have a special focus or a special interest in allergy, so maybe this is not surprising. And 6, 6, 4 same ratings."
"So here they say, when you adapt treatment, so escalation treatment. So if you have exacerbation or give me a second, so here, this is about patients after exacerbation, they always have their corticosteroids. So patients without exacerbation, I don't think it makes sense to just start at the highest level of treatment, so I wouldn't start a patient before or without a history of exacerbation on the full triple treatment. I mean, I really think what the question is so first exacerbation don't escalate treatment step by step, this is the moment where you want to prescribe full triple treatment, but you wouldn't do it before the first exacerbation. Right? So then you have these individual step, step by treatment approach may allow for disease progression and long term damage. So what they say here is this stepwise or stepwise treatment is not, what they don't recommend."
"Same thing. So here there is also the recommendation not to delay maintenance treatment after exacerbation, however  inaudible 00:48:03  five for relevance from the stepwise treatment, credibility five, I think you always have to look at your patients and individually take a look at every individual patient to decide what you want to prescribe."
"I'm not sure, so this information is not for a pulmonologist, is it? I mean, these are the basics. So this basic information is this for students, medical school students for patients, I'm wondering. I mean, and I really think smoking cessation is the number one aspect, so this is what they have to start with. All the rest is a secondary relevance. Pulmonary rehab. Yes. So here pulmonary rehabilitation is so important, so doing sports and exercising and I would really want to say smoking cessation is the number one treatment approach or the key aspect of treatment."
"I think I say, and this will be my headline, nothing new, so I haven't received any new information, so there's been loads of relevant information, but it's information I'm well aware of. I mean, I've been in my field for 20 years, and so it's always been in these past 20 years, the focus has been on preventing exacerbation because this is exactly what accelerates disease progression, eosinophil count is not new aspect either. So what's really missing is this new aspect. I mean, everything is perfectly right, so I agree fully to each and every page. So exacerbation is so important, there are so important to treat. This is just what our job is about. So nothing new here."
"I think the most important thing really is smoking cessation, this is absolutely. So if you find some drug that makes the cigarette smoke like shit, I mean, this would really be what we'd like to find, but other than this, I mean all the rest yeah, it's also relevant to prevent exacerbations and I don't know what in the eosinophil count and the comorbidities and all that, but smoking cessation is the centerpiece of it all."
"Yeah. Product X has the benefit of inhaled steroid. So compared to  Lamalaba 00:53:14 , but also compared to ICS, To ICS laba. So you have a constantly low level of the eosinophil count. So this is what you have under product X. So I was surprised that... No was not surprised, it definitely shows the benefits of the edit ICS and overall, it also shows that triple therapy is superior to all the other options, dual or mono."
"If you questions, whether there's a good fit, yes, there is a good fit. But I think lung specialists, they have very, very, very little time, and now if you come, if your reps come over with, I mean, relevant information that is well known to lung specialists, I'd really say really reduce it to the essential. I mean, there is interesting information the world where the globe prevalence is interesting. I mean, it's not relevant information, but it is interesting, this is an eye catcher, but other than this, I would really say, choose, pick very, very few pages."
"You don't want to waste lung specialist's time by just showing them information they're already aware with, the maybe eosinophil count, make sure you assess and identify that marker. But other than this, there is no... I mean, what I also liked was their product X information. So this is relevant, and you see, there is a significant benefit over lamalaba, but also over a lab ICS, I mean, and there are all the products available, and I think pulmonologists, they have heard, they know all this studies and all the information."
"Maybe a little more. But I mean, there was also NGPs, I think more often they are still are very hesitant when it comes to ICS, because there was the information don't prescribe ICS in your COPD patients this is just reserved for asthma. And now it's in a way coming back after it was recommended against. And I also removed when it was recommended, when corticosteroids were recommended against, I also took it away from some of my patients and they're getting worse, they keep getting worse, and so GPs, I would think they'd be incredibly happy if they have this information, they'd be excited to have all this information, and to hear this is what you can do is the recommendation to prescribe a triple, including the  inaudible 00:57:09  corticosteroid, and I would be excited to know they're not making any mistakes and they won't harm their patients, but for a pulmonologist, no news. But I think we've heard at all, what is the right dose? So what do you do? And what are the figures? What are the numbers? What are the trials? So no new information here, but yeah, reassuring it is."
"What's missing is the side effects. So you have corticosteroid side effects, and this is why I'd be afraid a little, if you show this information to your GPs. So they probably  inaudible 00:57:53  start prescribing ICS or this triple option in their COPD patients, which is not what we should do. So, I mean, be careful, we have to be very cautious,  inaudible 00:58:05  not experts in this field, and you do have to make sure that you prescribe corticosteroids carefully and just in a very targeted way and only where necessary."
"This is right. So I mean, but you can say is, don't wait before they're getting worse on their current treatment. So starting early on with triple is an all right decision, but you really have to look at every single patient. So you might want to start with edit oral corticosteroids after the first exacerbation. But I also put patients on the fixed combination after the first exacerbation, but also ask them in after a short period of time, and you have to monitor these patients very, very well and very closely."
"Emphysema patients who don't cough much where symptoms are not a big problem, but I think even this patient would probably be suitable."
"Yeah. I mean, you do have to make sure that you don't over-prescribe it. But every one, every patient in theory would qualify for it. But patients who don't have cough, no exacerbation in their history, but it needed so you really want to prescribe it if it's needed, but not before that moment. And the 50% of my patients that receive a triple combination, I mean, not necessarily will be continued on the triple combination."
"So my story, so if I were the rep, I'd just really keep it very short, so I'm here to talk about COPD, this is an incredibly widespread disease, this the third most of frequent disease worldwide. In Germany we have an enormous number of COPD patients, but if you see the global map here, the world map, you see that their prevalence is a lot higher, in the Southern hemisphere COPD is dramatically associated with mortality. Each exacerbation increases the risk of mortality."
"And then there is the vicious circle of cardiovascular diseases, all the comorbidities and inactivity, smoking, hypertension, increase of stroke and MI, and the moment you have the inflammation from the exacerbation, you have the negative impact on the heart. And so you have the increased risk of your cardiac conditions, therefore it is incredibly important to prevent exacerbation, and then I'd put the focus on inhaled corticosteroids. So I'd say we know that inhaled corticosteroids might be very important for many patients, and then I'd also talk about the eosinophil count, and I would also then say that  inaudible 01:03:02  ICS triple therapy might in the long run prevent or be the best possible preventative measure when it comes to exacerbations. And I would then also add, so you have the fixed combination, which is the most effective choice. End of story."
"This is just all I can say, I mean as I said before, not relevant, but incredibly important. And keep C in I'd keep in D yeah. If, and it is important. It's difficult to say what to remove, but you have to, in a way, try to shrink it, make it smaller, I mean, the cardiovascular comorbidities, I'd remove those. And H remove it too or maybe combine it, turn it into one page."
"Remove it. Let's say, and the eosinophil count we have it covered elsewhere. I mean, K remove K keep J this shortening of the shortened intervals. I'd also keep those M remove M, N stays N, O is gone, and P is just too simple, overly simple."
"I mean, it would be so wonderful if we had something, a new product out there for COPD, but oh, well, there's that? How many more interviews will there be?"
"Okay, great, wonderful. And have a great evening."
"So I'm a consultant respiratory physician. I've been a doctor for 26 years. I've been a consultant for 15 years in respiratory medicine. I do general respiratory medicine. I have a special interest in sleep ventilation bronchiectasis, but basically I do a bit of everything. I work in a big DGH with eight other colleagues. That's it really."
"DGH, district general hospital. Yeah. So not a teaching hospital, just a really big general hospital."
"Each month, so inpatients and outpatients?"
"So generally older, I'd say 50 to 80, or 60 to 80. Probably two-thirds men, a third women. Our local population is pretty Caucasian, not much ethnic diversity, particularly in the COPD population."
"All the ones we would see would be severe and very severe. Obviously the mild and the moderate don't really get past our door because they're managed in primary care by and large. Of course, some of them will have exacerbations and we will see them, but the vast majority would be at the severe and more severe end of the spectrum."
"Sorry. What do you mean, open and closed?"
"I don't quite understand. So you said, what ... Oh, do you mean a triple inhaler or triple therapy? Whether it's in one or two inhalers?"
"Oh, oh. So triple therapy. Oh, the vast majority of the ones I see would be, oh, 80%. But in terms of whether they're on a triple inhaler or whether they're on triple therapy, probably 25% will be on triple inhaler."
"Well, those with very severe or severe disease, particularly if they're stable and they're not in and out of hospital a lot. So we don't need to spot the LAMA when they come into hospital. But yeah, absolutely, obviously follow the guidelines and people end up on it if they're severe enough and they meet criteria in terms of FEV1 and exacerbations and symptoms."
"It depends if they're in the outpatient clinic and it's not urgent, urgent, and of course these things aren't. The GP would change it. But often on hospital discharge we might change it. So probably actually most of the time we'd be recommending the GP does it, or the community COPD team."
"So history probably most important. So the history of the breathlessness associated symptoms, cough, wheeze, sputum, weight loss, hemoptysis. Red flag symptoms, obviously. Smoking history really important, obviously, for the diagnosis. And then look at examination findings. Have they got features consistent with COPD, are they hyperexpanded? Are they wheezy? Look at their spirometry, look at their x-ray. And obviously, think about whether COPD is the most likely diagnosis or whether there's an additional cause or maybe two diagnoses. So those would be the things you'd look at and then a trial of therapy."
"So I think you'd look at symptoms versus physiological measurements. So for example, if they didn't have a very big smoking history and their lung function was pretty well preserved, yet they were disproportionately breathless or their cough was more of a feature or sputum was more of a feature. You might think, well, maybe they've got some underlying interstitial lung disease or some bronchiectasis in addition. Or maybe they've got asthma in addition, or maybe they've got cardiac disease. Maybe they've got atrial fibrillation or cardiomyopathy in addition. So just kind of teasing out what the proportion of the symptoms can be attributed to the abnormal physiology."
So my next step would be obviously the history as to whether it fitted. Do they have ankle edema? Were they breathless at night? Did they have a history of response to furosemide or a prior arrhythmogenic or ischemic heart disease history? I'd probably do a BNP. I'd look at the x-ray. I would request an echocardiogram. They'd have had an ECG.
"So I guess it depends what it is. If you think it's ischemic heart disease, I would start some treatment and then probably send them over to the cardiologist. If it looked like pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to their airway disease, we would treat that. Occasionally we'd send them onto the cardiologists. We would often start a trial of furosemide. If they've got an arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, we'd start some treatment for that."
"And actually, it's probably a bit more common that we pick this up when people are decompensating and in hospital, because we've got a bit more time, obviously, to look at things and a bit more time to assess response to treatment. But we would certainly absolutely start the treatment for the heart disease, whatever form that took."
"Well, it depends what it is really. If they've got awful crashing heart failure, they might have ended up in hospital. If they've just got a little bit of peripheral edema and a slightly abnormal echo, probably most of them would eventually end up under cardiology. They'd probably be seen once. It depends how bad it is really. And those with heart failure picked up in, well either, but particularly picked up in hospital would end up under the community heart failure team."
"So I think it, obviously it's such a massive spectrum and it depends whether it's just a little bit of minor heart failure which might just need some furosemide and a beta blocker or whether it's much more substantial than that. So probably if we are at the point where the breathlessness wasn't fully explained by the COPD I probably would send them to a cardiologist."
"Yeah, we would refer to them from either the clinic, but more often from if the patient has been an inpatient and they would follow them up. And actually, most of these people, we don't follow up long-term. We have a cohort of really severe or complex COPD who are either on ventilation or being worked up for transplant or valves or other complex therapies. They would stay under clinic follow-up, but the vast majority of those people, the vast majority of COPD we don't follow up. The numbers are too large, but also there are other pathways whereby they're followed up by the community team."
"So if they're established on there, the diagnosis is made, the diagnosis is certain. There isn't significant comorbidity. They are in a stable phase. We don't necessarily follow them up. And even following hospital discharge, they would be seen in a nurse-led clinic if they were non complex, or in the community COPD team. So actually most of these people aren't under follow-up with us, and that would be standard across the country. That's not unusual to our hospital. That's just how the systems are set up."
Common non-respiratory. I'd say either frailty or obesity.
Because it's really difficult to manage and it's common and it's complex and it causes really significant problems.
"Well, people cope less well with their symptoms. They fall over. Frailty is a syndrome complex, which might include heart failure and osteoporosis and sarcopenia and dementia. It's an aging comorbidity basically, but it's just common in an elderly population with COPD. And it means they just tolerate all their symptoms less well. And they end up coming to hospital more frequently, probably."
"Well, we obviously take ownership or responsibility whilst the patient is under our care. If you're talking about outpatients, we'd obviously start a workup, refer onto a specialist as required. Inpatient obviously we would take probably more ownership over everything and ask for a referral, review on the ward if necessary. But yeah, absolutely. We would manage all the comorbidities, whether that was their diabetes, their immobility, their dementia, their frailty, their falls risk, their steroid side effects, their psychological distress with their symptoms, their heart failure, their arrhythmia, their previous MI. So kind of everything really, because that's what we do."
"Oh, definitely think about it. Yeah, because actually it's common, as I said, particularly in those patients with decompensation who are ending up as an inpatient. Probably should focus a little bit more about it as an outpatient as well, I guess. But yeah. These patients have got cardiovascular risk factors. They're elderly, they're often male, they've been smokers. They may have had hypertension and diabetes and yeah. So it's common and important."
"Yes. In that you're going to treat the cardiovascular disease. In terms of whether that impacts on whether it alters the treatment for the airway disease, no it doesn't. But as I said, it would probably help to explain deterioration symptoms and why someone's not getting better or why the COPD treatment isn't helping as much as you think it might do because there's an underlying cause for the symptoms."
"Have no risk factors?   00:14:03  No as in zero? Or, sorry, known did you say?"
"Well, if they're smokers, all of them. Vast majority, I don't know, 95% of them will have cardiovascular risk factors by definition if they've been a smoker."
"Well, they're common generally in a population and they're common in an older population. So yeah, they are. So hypertension and diabetes, I guess, family history and hypercholesterolemia. But for this cohort, it'll be ex smoking or ex smoking and age probably would be the commonest."
"Yeah, depends what they're in with. And obviously if they're in with an exacerbation of our COPD, they will be in under us. So that'll be, or certainly deemed to have been the major problem on admission. But actually, if it's clear after a day or two, actually this is all heart failure and the airway disease is less of an issue, that will be at the point to involve the heart failure specialist team earlier. Yeah. But we would always look at both obviously."
"Well, obviously if they've had an ischemic event they go off to cardiology and  inaudible 00:15:54  unit. If they've got a really complex arrhythmia, which isn't really common in this cohort that I see, the heart failure would usually be under us or joint care. Yeah. So I guess it's the more complex specialists cardiac stuff that would end up under cardiology sooner rather later."
"Oh yeah. Frequently. They see the patient with breathlessness who the GP has, or another specialist, but commonly the GP has referred to them because they're breathless. And the suspicion is that it's a cardiac cause, most likely heart failure. And they very frequently think that it's not relevant or not the cause of the symptoms all very minor. And then would send on to us. Yeah. That's quite a common situation."
"No, they haven't usually done a workup at all. No, they might have requested some lung function, but usually they haven't because we would sort that out when we see the patient."
"So usually they have seen a cardiologist, probably had a BNP and an echo. Had a trial of heart failure treatment, which I haven't done much, or they don't think heart failure was really at play to start off with. And then they just asked us to see them. Or they've been referred and they had an angiogram or a ... Oh, that's the other situation. So that again, that's quite common where they've done a CT coronary angiogram because of breathlessness or the concern of ischemic heart disease. And they've picked up a nodule or pulmonary fibrosis or bad emphysema. So a non-cardiac cause picked up on the CTCA kind of coincidentally. So they would send to us. But the more common scenario is where they have been sent the patient via the GP who thinks they've got heart failure as the cause of their breathlessness and the cardiologists don't think it's that relevant or that serious such that it's causing the symptoms."
"Oh yeah. The GP thinks it's airway disease, and we take a look at them and think, no, I think this is, maybe they've got minor airway disease, but actually there's something else. Either they've got another respiratory cause, such as pulmonary fibrosis, that's quite common, or actually, they've just got heart failure."
"Yeah, we would do our workup to make sure we've got it all right. So we'd do some lung function. We do some imaging, whether that's an x-ray or CT, depending on what's required. And then we would send over to another specialist."
"There is, and I think we're poor at recognizing it, and I think I might have seen some data where patients are more likely to have had an ischemic event at around the time of their airway disease exacerbation. So yeah, definitely. We should be thinking about it more and probably don't focus on it enough. And probably, as you've already touched on, don't think about it enough in terms of the global risk of the patient in that these patients have significant cardiovascular risk factors. And we often don't really focus on that or think about primary prevention in these people, because we're probably a bit over focused on the airways disease."
"I suspect it's, oh, I suspect hypoxia is relevant. I suspect hypoxic vasoconstriction is relevant. I suspect an inflammatory cascade is relevant. What else might be driving it? And probably thrombosis and sort of stasis, I suspect is probably also relevant."
"How should it? Well, we should be thinking about the other organs involved. We should be thinking about, obviously we think about smoking cessation. We should probably be thinking about diabetes screening. And obviously we kind of do that by chance anyway, from when they're in hospital. We should think about doing a cholesterol. We should think about diet and exercise, which are things we think about anyway in COPD. But I guess we could be more structured about it. We could think about primary prevention."
"I suppose a bit of both really. I think we think about general health and we think about weight and fitness and exercise capacity. And of course, lots of these patients are obese, they're deconditioned. Lots of them are going to have Type II diabetes anyway, whether or not we've diagnosed it, but lots of them will have. Lots of them are already on an anti-hypertensive. Quite a lot of them already had ischemic event and will be on a statin and/or aspirin or something. So I think a lot of them are already diagnosed, but I guess if you're talking about the ones that aren't diagnosed, and we should be thinking about it because of their risk factors, yeah, absolutely we should be."
"Yeah, definitely. Yeah. If they've got angina or unstable angina or they've got poor rate-controlled flutter fibrillation, or if they've got ischemic cardiomyopathy and their breathless because of that. Yeah. That's quite common actually."
"Well, it's not exacerbating the COPD per se, but it is making them breathless. And it's probably a combination of the breathlessness being a bit of their airway disease and a bit of their heart disease."
"Okay. So you've got four big COPD, I think they were inhaler studies looking at cause of death in all the patients. And certainly the LHS study shows ... Oh, that's cancer. So basically, a good between 15 and 40% of cause of death will be cardiac-related. There's quite a variability isn't there? So 16 in UPLIFT. I'm trying to think which UPLIFT is. Is UPLIFT the study that's-"
"I know it's called UPLIFT. I can't remember which inhaler study UPLIFT is. I think it's a combination. Anyway, I think, yeah, it doesn't really matter, I guess. But yeah, a bit of a variety isn't there? 16 to 39% cause of death cardiac-related, but obviously a significant chunk of the cause of death actually."
"I guess it's more than I would think. And I guess that's the slight difficulty, isn't it? Because I'm seeing these patients. So if someone comes in and has a cardiac cause of death, I would necessarily know about that or see that because it'll be they've come with an MI or an awful arrhythmia, but I guess these are probably ischemic events, aren't they, probably by and large, or some heart failure death. Those people will end up, presuming these all, they're not necessarily patients admitted to hospital, but I presume quite a lot of them are."
"So I wouldn't necessarily know about that. So maybe that's why I don't think about it in quite the same way or don't focus on it quite as much. Because by definition, when the patient comes in with an exacerbation of their airways disease, they end up at a respiratory ward under a respiratory physician and we will treat that exacerbation. So if two weeks later, they come in with a myocardial infarction under the cardiologist and die, we wouldn't necessarily know about that. In fact, we definitely wouldn't know about that."
"So that's probably why we might be less aware of it or focus less on it, but up to 40% in EUROSCOP study, and matter of fact, that's the smallest study isn't it? But yeah, it's a significant proportion."
"I guess it makes me think that a smaller proportion are going to die from a respiratory cause. So I need to think about optimizing cardiac status and thinking about primary prevention or thinking about whether symptoms are really respiratory-related or whether they could be cardiac-related. I don't know if you've got another slide, but maybe you're going to tell me that the cardiovascular causes, are these all ischemic events? I'm guessing most are. Or are they not?"
Right. It's going to tell me what proportion are MI related or ... okay.
"Yes. So twice as more. So COPD  inaudible 00:28:13  CPOD alone. Ischemic heart disease plus COPD. Heart failure and COPD. Ischemic heart failure and COPD. Heart failure. Yeah, okay."
"So it's really common, a bit frighteningly common. So really, really likely to have, if you've got COPD you're much more ... Or I guess this is all ... So it makes your COPD worse and you're more likely to die of an ischemic event as well."
"No, that data was different. That was just looking at population prevalence. This is looking at whether or not you've got COPD and whether that has an impact on your ischemic heart disease. Which I guess is something that I hadn't particularly thought about before, but I guess that's the reason. Yeah."
"It is quite high, isn't it? Up to 140% more, and significantly more than those without COPD. Yeah. It's kind of at least two or three times the rate, isn't it? So, yeah, that is quite high."
"No, I guess you would think about it a bit more. It's often something that should be done in primary care. What I don't understand from this slide, and maybe again, you've got another slide, is whether this is in primary or secondary prevention. So in those people with COPD, are they potentially 140 times more likely to have a primary event? Or if they've already got ischemic heart disease, do they do much worse if they have underlying disease or a second event? I don't know if that data's out there, because that's kind of almost more relevant and interesting."
"So those patients who have already had an MI, for example, they're already going to be on secondary prevention. But those patients with COPD who have risk factors for ischemic heart disease, who haven't already had a cardiac event, is their data to show that if you give them primary prevention they do better? Maybe there is, but then that would strike me as the place where you could make the most difference. So that might be interesting."
"It's just an interest really, isn't it? And it might make more of a difference to what we do and how we manage these patients potentially."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly, exactly. Which is why it might be more important to know whether ... thinking about that. It may be, I don't know."
"Okay. Right. Oh gosh. Okay. That's quite frightening, isn't it? Risk of MI doubles within five days. I don't think I knew that. That's quite high, isn't it? Risk of stroke increases 40% in 10 days. Hmm. Okay. Okay. That's interesting, and probably much higher than I thought. Much higher. Yeah."
"So moderate exacerbation defined as  inaudible 00:32:37  of oral steroids and I can't ... Your little thing's covering the description. Pre-selected oral. Okay. So any exacerbation by definition is pretty much moderate because any exacerbation that basically gets anyone's attention or in fact, obviously most of these patients will self-treat. So any exacerbation requiring steroids or antibiotics is, by this definition, moderate. So that's a bit frightening, isn't it?"
"No. I think you treat the COPD the same, but I think you would be ... But again, so this is relevant if there is then data to say, if I've got a patient who's having a moderate exacerbation of COPD, they should then start aspirin, or they should then immediately start a statin or  inaudible 00:33:39  or something."
"So the only way this would change what I do is being ... So unless there's data to say that adding in a cardiac-modifying drug at the time of exacerbation reduces this risk. Actually, you're not going to do anything other than say, well, I guess, if you get more breathless two weeks later, maybe in fact, you have had a silent MI and you've now got heart failure and it's not your airways disease  inaudible 00:34:08 . So that is something to think about. Definitely. That's interesting."
"Make sure you definitely take your tablets if you are already on secondary prevention. If you get some chest pain, it's not necessarily musculoskeletal related to coughing related to your airway disease exacerbation. Maybe in fact, it's some angina. So I guess those are slightly different ways of thinking about things, which ... yeah."
"Oh, in terms of reducing ... Yeah, absolutely. That's another way of thinking about it, which I probably should have mentioned. Yeah, absolutely. So making sure people are on optimum inhaled therapy or tablets for their airway disease. So they are less likely to have an exacerbation. Yeah, exactly. So they've stopped smoking, they're doing some exercise, they're keeping on their weight. They are taking their inhaled therapy. The triple combination. Yeah. So adding ... yeah. Making sure they're on all the inhaled therapies available sooner rather than later to prevent the respiratory exacerbation. Yeah."
"All-cause mortality weeks a year. Product X, triple combination of ICS LAMA/LABA. In moderate to very severe. LAMA/LABA. Yeah. Okay. So I guess all-cause mortality, do we know that already? Yeah, I suppose we do, don't we? Yes. You are less likely to die. 49% reduction. So another triple inhaler with an NMT of 80. That's pretty good. Yeah. So it's very effective at, meaning you are less likely to die for all causes. So that will be your cardiovascular and your respiratory causes over a year. Yeah. Okay."
"I guess that's a big drop. Do I know that people definitely have a reduced risk of death? Yes. I wouldn't have thought it was that big, because that seems like a big difference over   00:36:40 "
"Well, I guess it would say that people should be on a triple inhaler sooner rather later. Because in fact, you get diversions of the curves pretty early on, don't you? At a couple of months things are definitely different. Or certainly from the LAMA/LABA to the triple. And then you're diverging it in week 10, aren't you? So actually pretty early. Yeah."
On and off-treatment. Low incidence of cardiovascular events. All-cause mortality.
"Okay. So they're saying the respiratory causes of death are about the same. Counts are the same obviously of all-causes cardiovascular. Yeah. So it's halving. So maybe it's the steroid component because that's the same. Dementia patients. Low incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. I'm not sure that tells me anything different, to be honest. Stroke. Cardiovascular. Okay. So there's something about the steroid component or the LAMA. Okay."
"Well, it seems to be ... Well, certainly the LAMA/LABA versus the ICS/LABA. Or maybe it's the LAMA not being in there. Feels like it's probably the steroid, maybe it's the LAMA. Don't know. You can't tell from that graph."
"Yeah. I guess. If we mentioned earlier that, what's the mechanism? Is it inflammatory cascade? Is it airway inflammation causing worsening constriction and hypoxic vasoconstriction? I suspect it's all inflammatory cascade, isn't it? Probably. It's probably a bit everything, but I suspect it's inflammation. And if you've got an inhaled steroid and less inflammation, maybe that might be the mechanism."
It'll be a general inflammatory process. It won't be as straightforward as just being an airways inflammatory process. I'm sure.
"Well, it shouldn't. It should just be absorbed into the lungs, but I guess maybe it does. I don't know."
"Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Because your studies are showing your risk of death is lower and your risk of cardiovascular events is lower and your risk of exacerbation is lower. So that all ties in, doesn't it?"
"So you've got all-cause mortality, and now you're telling me that actually it's a cardiovascular reduction. Yeah. Okay. So that's the same   00:41:49 . Yeah. That's just ... yeah. Okay. Yeah. So you're just telling me that the explanation is that it's cardiovascular death as opposed to all-cause mortality. Yeah. Okay."
"Yes, I guess so. Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I'd slightly assume that the risk of death was respiratory causes, but there's obviously something else about this product that has an impact on cardiovascular death."
"Well, that would be a good thing, wouldn't it? Particularly when you told me that, whatever that original first graph said that, I think it was up to 40% of deaths are cardiovascular. So yeah, if you can prevent those deaths and all the comorbidities associated with the cardiovascular event, that's probably a good thing."
"The magnitude of absolute for mortality in a single-inhaler triple therapy is similar to that in observed cardiovascular studies. Okay. So annualized. So statin, statin, ACE, SGLT. Therapy."
"Okay. Yeah. So in fact, you are saying that you use these inhalers, it's actually this similar or better than the standard kind of primary prevention in the cardiovascular studies. Yeah."
"No. Again, that's surprising. Yeah, no interesting because it is, again much higher. I never thought of these inhaled therapies as being cardio protective, which this data would suggest that they are."
"Yes, potentially. So there maybe something about that specific combination or those specific ... the ICS, I guess. Yeah. Although that's kind of small numbers. You haven't told me the numbers, have you?"
"There are differences in the inhaled steroids, there are differences in side effects. There's always the cardiovascular concern about  inaudible 00:45:22  pneumonia and things. So there clearly is something in that signal, potentially."
"Slightly horrifying.   00:45:53  much higher. That's very interesting and slightly scary data, that your risk of an MI is, I can't what you said, doubled at five days and stroke at 10 days. So yeah, absolutely. That's slightly frightening data and that's an awful lot of cardiovascular risk that we're potentially not thinking about, not recognizing. Yeah. Interesting."
"So I think the really interesting thing for me would be if you then, say if you've got a patient who has no known cardiovascular disease, but their risk factor is their age and their ex smoking, and maybe they're on an anti-hypertensive already. Whether there's data to show that you can reduce the risk of that MI or that stroke by putting them on aspirin or an antiplatelet or a statin at the time of their exacerbation."
"So that would be interesting. If there isn't, there's kind of not a lot else you could do about it. You can risk profile them. You can do an HbA1c or  inaudible 00:47:16 , if you've got a risk of Type II diabetes, but that's only going to be diet management to start off with. You can check a cholesterol, but I guess the really important thing is whether they should have an antiplatelet started at the time of their exacerbation, or whether it would continue if they were current exacerbators. Because as I said, a lot of these people already are on an anti-hypertensive. Actually a proportion, I couldn't tell you what number probably, I don't know, 27% are already on some cardiovascular disease-modifying drugs because they have had an event already. Yeah. What else would you do?"
"Oh yeah, totally. We do it all the time if there's a reason for it. But aspirin isn't without risk, particularly as you get into an older population. So you'd have to have good reason to do it. And of course, a lot of these people are polypharmacy. These people come in on piles of medications already. So actually a lot of them already will be on these medications anyway, because they've had an event before."
"No, I think it's both, isn't it? I think it's thinking about modifying the risk of a cardiovascular event, but with that, these slides would also suggest that actually we should be preventing the exacerbations because they're going to have a cardiovascular event within 10 days of their, or they're at higher risk of having a cardiovascular event within 10 days of their exacerbations. So therefore, actually the obvious thing to do is to prevent the exacerbation and get people on triple therapy sooner."
"So it's this product X and Y, isn't it? Or product X that would be better than anything else. Starting that sooner at the time, presumably at the time of the second exacerbation to prevent further exacerbation. So they don't die of a cardiovascular event soon after."
"Yes, potentially. If there's data out there to show that it makes a difference in terms of non-respiratory death or morbidity. Yeah, absolutely."
"Yeah. If it was going to reduce all-cause mortality, reduce morbidity following vascular events, and it was going to reduce the exacerbation of and/or severity of the COPD. Yeah, definitely."
"No, I don't think so. Sorry. My doorbell's just gone. Give me one second. Sorry."
"Hi, thank you. Hi, come in. Hi, how are you? Yes I have. You're such a good boy. Oh, thank you so much.  Inaudible 00:51:37  Thank you. See you later."
"Yeah, anything else. No, no, I don't think so. I think it's all really food for thought. That's very interesting. Thank you. That's made me think about things slightly differently, so that's all good."
"That's what I was going to say. I've got a problem. So I'm logged into the Adobe Connect app, but it says unable to validate user. You cannot access  inaudible 00:02:58 , your meeting login has expired."
"Yeah. So definitely COPD is a big part of my job. So I manage COPD in the hospital setting. When they exacerbate acutely, they come under my care when I'm covering the wards. And I look after them during their acute exacerbation. If they're coming to hospital for other reasons other than COPD, but they also happen to have  inaudible 00:04:13  with their COPD. Then as an inpatient, I can also close their management and then probably the bulk of what I do has been  inaudible 00:04:25  COPD or at least an equal part of the inpatient work is the outpatient work. I look after a lot of patients with different severities of COPD, diagnose COPD, I manage COPD in the long term through different modalities and different treatment options and management plan. I refer COPD patients onto other specialists when there's a need."
"So triple therapy is commonly prescribed maybe less so than five years ago when we were giving ICS routinely to most of our COPD patients. Now I tend to not start ICS initially, or even I sometimes take people off ICS if it's not appropriate for them to be on it. But a lot of my patients who are kind of the most severe and the severe spectrum or those that are exacerbating quite for frequently, or those that have an elevated  inaudible 00:05:51  count, then I do use ICS on them. So they tend to be on triple therapy. Most of my patients are not on single therapy. They're either on dual, LABA/LAMA or on triple therapy."
"Not necessarily, yeah. I would say maybe that's not the right way to phrase it. I would say we're using less ICS in general than we did maybe five, 10 years ago in COPD. Where it was much more routine to put people on a LABA/ICS inhaler. But now we don't go to ICS straight away as first or even as secondary therapy  inaudible 00:06:48  ."
"Maybe about 50%. 4o-50%, something like that."
How many of those that are on triple therapy?
"Or how many, in total of my COPD patients? Okay. So of those that are on triple therapy..."
"Total COPD patients? I'd say maybe about 10% on a fixed dose, six combination really."
"But that figure is rising. If you'd asked me six months ago, I would've maybe said 5%. This figure is rising fairly rapidly actually."
"I think because these are new inhalers and the more experience we have with them, the more we see other colleagues prescribe them, the more confident we feel with them. So there's that inherent bias if we can call it that where we see others prescribing it, we feel more confident or comfortable when we see others doing it. And also because it's more convenient for the patients."
"The inhalers that we're using at six dose are Trelegy and Trimbow. Those are the two that we have on our formulary. I know there's two others, but I've not yet had an experience with them or even seen being prescribed. I must say I'm testing now, moving away from the Trelegy devices and probably I would prefer now to give Trimbow instead."
Probably the most topic issue at the moment is the move away from Ellipta. I don't know if all those involved in the community are doing that. But I think some are certainly moving away from the  inaudible 00:10:12  devices which includes Trelegy.
Yeah. It says you have joined the session in Adobe Connect app.
It's very compelling. It's very strong and very clear.
"It's quite hard data, it's about mortality, it's about readmissions things that you can't really get wrong. It's a hard outcome measure,"
The fact that it's the second most common cause of emergency admissions. I didn't expect that to be that high.
"Yeah, I thought more towards 30%, but I may not be appraised with the most recent data, so 40% is not too far off."
"Probably the data regarding mortality. The fact that its the third leading cause. That square, the largest square out of the five squares sorry, the circle and that writing under the circle is the largest. I think that the authors of the poster are trying to emphasize that point as well."
It doesn't show me the references. I would need to...
"Just bear with me one second. It's quite a busy stat. Again, I think it's quite strong, quite compelling. The fact that there is such a big disparity the map of the world. No such disparity between countries, in terms of COPD related mortality rates, the contrast is quite amazing."
"I was going to say yes, in the sense that you see that third world countries doing worse. But when you look a bit closer, actually, England has quite high mortality rates, UK and even the US. The US has quite high mortality rates from COPD. So actually, it's not just a third world phenomenon."
Right. I find that quite interesting actually.
"I think variation between or variability between different countries and even within countries. So when it zooms into the map of the UK, you see North of England does much worse than the South of England."
"Which is interesting. But very strong point that's probably the most compelling point that hits home most for me. Why is there such a big disparity? I can see the darker areas, the darker shades in the North of England and South of Scotland, much darker than dev and Exeter and Southwestern, even London. That's quite amazing within a country, which is one of the most kind of developed countries in the world. You've got so much disparity and that's probably the main take home messages."
I think probably just what I just said about variability even within a country which is a developed country. That's probably the most critical point I would say.
I'd say six. The reason I score a bit lower for this slide and the previous slide is because both of these slides or not focused specifically on exacerbations.
"Okay. This is a very good slide actually, especially when it comes to evaluation, this is focused on exacerbations."
"I think it's a bit more focused than the other two slides. The focus specifically is on exacerbations. The other two, there was a mismatch of different data. Then I quite like the data because it's definitely credible, it names the studies, Eclipse Uplifting  inaudible 00:25:50  Studies . Yeah. And it shows a graph. I have to say, 50 to 78%, I'm quite amazed by that don't even report the exacerbation. That's quite amazing. I didn't expect it to do that home. And then I really like the right side of the slide."
"Yeah, I really like that, the way it has an impact on the patient's health in a kind of a downward spiral each. And that's exactly what it looks like. It looks like a spiral. Each exacerbation affects people adversely in these ways."
Yeah. I didn't expect it to be that high actually. That's quite worrying actually.
Yeah. Sadly I would say the majority of people at least within a three year period to do have a...
"I think the main takeaway message is the harms of an exacerbation which leads you to think about the importance of reducing the frequency of these exacerbations. This is really, really important data. Actually, this is really compelling data. I know it's only from the wisdom trial, but this is really concerning data, worrying data."
"Yeah, I think so. I think what's interesting, which I didn't appreciate I have to say, is the fact that the lung function declaring is working those that have mild to moderate disease."
"Yeah. I didn't appreciate that actually prior to looking at this. I knew that  inaudible 00:29:42  wouldn't recover back to normal, but I didn't appreciate that the biggest impact of those that have mild to moderate disease rather than those that have severe disease."
"Again, it's credible, it quotes the study, it shows the graphs. The message is very clear. Slightly busy slide, but I think the message is very clear that exacerbations can leave the patient worse off than compared to prior to the exacerbation. Specifically, although this is only looking at lung function on  inaudible 00:30:40 , it doesn't look at quality of life or exercise tolerance, or other parameters. I think which may be more patient centered. If we look at other parameters like the quality of life or a MYC grade or  inaudible 00:30:55  . But nevertheless, I think this is really important."
"It's talking about very hard endpoints, death and hospitalization, which you can't really argue with or argue against. And the  inaudible 00:32:57  graph on the right and the higher the number of exacerbations, the worse the prognosis or survivability. The fact that the risk of death is 80%, that's quite high with two exacerbations in one year."
Yeah maybe I think so. I think that's quite   00:33:45 .
"The higher the number of exacerbations, the higher risk of death."
"Yeah, of course it does. Of course and it makes you think about exacerbations and reducing exacerbation frequency, et cetera, and the burden. The other thought that I have is just Jane devil advocate, they've probably adjusted for this but, is exacerbation an independent risk factor for death? The answer probably is, yes. They probably have thought of this already, but the frequency of exacerbations is a reflection of the severity of the underlying COPD in the first place."
"Another way of wording it is saying actually the more severe the disease is, the higher chance of death, which makes it less surprising, right? It makes it less dramatic because you expect that with anything. You expect that with pulmi fibrosis, you expect that with heart failure, with kidney failure. The worse the disease, the higher risk of death. But I think they probably have adjusted for exacerbations as an independent risk factor, independent of the severity of..."
"I think the first one is not a surprise. I think we've got lots of data now showing that one of the biggest risk factors for future exacerbations is previous exacerbations and hospitalizations. But the data under that, the 80% data, I didn't expect it to be that high that is really high."
"I'd say 10 again, if I could. Really strong."
"Yeah. This is very interesting detail. People are not aware of this especially kind of general physicians and non-risk physicians. I've come across this data before. I didn't expect it to be that strong though, I have to admit."
Both actually. The MI data I was aware of. I didn't have the data in mind but I knew that there's a higher risk of MI. I wasn't aware that the risk of struggles that high. I wasn't aware   00:38:58 . Go ahead.
"The stroke data is a surprise and the data on the right actually, I didn't realize that. I didn't realize the data on the right as well that the risk continued for up to a year."
"I think this really emphasizes the point about comorbidities in COPD. We know COPD is not just a condition isolated to the lungs, it's actually a systemic condition that affects other organs  inaudible 00:39:47 ."
"Yeah. I think it just makes me more cognizant and encourages me to be aware of those patients that I'm looking after, that I'm following up after I've looked after them as an inpatient and I follow them up in the community. My outpatient clinic to be aware that they could, they're at risk of having an MI stroke that I need to watch out for these and encourage patients to report symptoms. If they have chest pain, if they have symptoms of a stroke to report them, not to ignore them."
"Just give me one second. I'm just looking in the right there, only one second."
"That's interesting. Again, I wasn't familiar with the data I have to admit, but it emphasizes what we know about the comorbidities in COPD that people don't often have COPD on its own. They do have other comorbidities. I wasn't aware that there is such a high mortality data though with the data on the right side."
I think people basically that have COPD plus other comorbidities are at higher risk of death compared to those that have COPD on its own.
"I think so. 40 to 140% increased risk of death for those that have COPD and skin cut disease. That's very high number. I wouldn't have imagined it's that high. 90% for those that have heart failure. I guess that's not that surprising. If you have COPD which is very vast and you've got respiratory failure and you've got heart failure, you've got two major organ failure that doesn't surprise me much. The diabetes data and the atrial  data 00:44:12  does. That's quite high."
"Yeah. So I guess what that is saying is slightly different to the rest of the slide that is saying that people with COPD are at higher risk of having other comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease. The rest of the slide says, those that have COPD and have cardiovascular disease are at higher risk of death. So there's two messages coming up from this slide. Probably the most compelling message is the mortality message."
"Yeah, that's probably the more compelling message of the two."
The slide is not focused about COPD exacerbations.
"When I compare it to the other slide, previous one, which talked about the risk of death immediately within the first 10 days and then after 30 days and then after a year after the exacerbation, that is very focused on exacerbation. That is very compelling. This one, there's no mention of exacerbation. There's no focus on exacerbation. So it motivates me to do other things, motivates me to think about comorbidities and screen for them and ask patients about them, educate patients about them, ask questions to report symptoms to do with diabetes or heart failure or heart disease. But there's no focus with exacerbations in this slide."
"That's a very interesting slide actually. On the one hand, it makes you think why would people be at higher risk if they've got moderate COPD than severe, shouldn't it be the other way around? But actually when you're thinking about it, and when you read into it a bit more carefully, those that are moderate disease, I guess, are more likely to die from other causes such as cardiovascular disease or whatever than COPD. Because their COPD is less severe than those that have severe COPD. So it does make sense."
I think the 39% mortality data is quite high.
"But the thing is it doesn't... Again, I'm saying that only because they're moderate disease, but they're not dying from their moderate COPD, they're dying from cardiovascular disease. So I guess in a sense, maybe it's not that surprising, it's just because it doesn't qualify the severity of the cardiovascular disease. Maybe that's why it's surprising. But my definition, because they're dying, they probably have quite severe cardiovascular disease."
"I guess it's not surprising because these people they've got a common pathway, they've got systemic inflammation, accelerated arteriosclerosis, they've got by definition, if smokers or ex-smokers. It's hardly surprising that they've got cardiovascular disease and they've got COPD."
"I think that the most important point I guess is again the very close associations of COPD and other comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular."
"Again, it's the same as previous slide. It doesn't focus on exacerbations per se. It's just talking about cardiovascular mortality in people that have moderate COPD. There's no mention of exacerbation. There's no focus on exacerbation."
"No it doesn't. It makes me cognizant and aware of cardiovascular comorbidities in COPD. Again makes me think about them. And makes me want to inform patients, make them aware of it or make other healthcare professionals aware of it to look out for it. If a patient is an inpatient in hospital and they're on exacerbation of COPD and they're having chest pain, don't ignore that, don't put that down to their COPD. Like any other patient, if someone is having chest pain, you need to do the ECG, you need to do the blood test to look out for a heart. That's what makes me think about it. It doesn't make me think about  inaudible 00:52:23 ."
"More relevant to exacerbation. Definitely this slide. This slide makes the link between exacerbations and cardiovascular mortality. So an answer to your question, why the other two slides were five out of seven, this is the answer. This is the slide that creates that link between exacerbations and cardiovascular mortality."
"Yeah. I don't know if it would've changed my score for the other slides, because those slides I was assessing them on their own merit. They weren't focused on exacerbation whereas this has several key take home messages. One again, about always being aware of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity and  inaudible 00:54:46  division. But number two, the fact that an exacerbation in itself, not just COPD at the steady state as a chronic disease increases your risk of death from cardiovascular mortality. But the exacerbation itself also increases your risk. There were previous slides which talk about during the exacerbation that in the first 10 days, the risk of mortality is such and such and the risk of stroke such and such and MI. And this slide tells you why the risk is high. It explains the pathophysiological mechanisms why that mortality is high. It doesn't give you the data, which is already been shown, but it tells you pathophysiologically at that level, why there's a link."
"I think the critical point is the risk of cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, stroke, heart failure, heart attacks, et cetera during or after an exacerbation. And the fact also risk factors for these two conditions that to begin with, the risk factors are similar. They share risk factors. Which is something that I mentioned in my feedback about the previous slide, smoking, et cetera. That's the main risk factor for both these conditions. But then it doesn't stop there. It's like a circle. It starts with the same risk factor, but then actually the exacerbation, obviously see if it is exacerbation actually also can contribute towards an acute cardiac event."
"So I would say ten for this, if I can. Definitely this slide is very motivating."
"It's a very simple slide, but the messages are quite nice and simple and key. It's emphasizing basically that you need to identify people at risk of exacerbation in order to prevent further exacerbations. And it tells you that there are three risk factors, I'm sure there's more, there are three risk factors for exacerbations. Number one are past exacerbations, which is a no-brainer and there's so much data proving that. Number two, if your breathlessness is worse. And that probably makes me think actually is not just a breathlessness as an independent risk factor. It's a composite measure of the underlying severity of COPD. The worst is COPD on  inaudible 00:58:54 . And therefore there was a higher exacerbation risk. And then also is NFL count which we talked about earlier. Here's, that's been shown to be an independent risk factor for exacerbation as well."
"I'm just trying to process the graph on the left, just give me a few   01:00:44 ."
"So this is a really interesting slide, actually. Not only do we know that the more exacerbations you have in the past, the higher risk of future exacerbations you have. This slide is saying that the time interval between issued exacerbation gets shorter and shorter which is very interesting."
"It's intuitive. It's something that you would expect, especially given that as the disease progress over time, you'd expect them to exacerbate more frequently. As they exacerbate more frequently, you'd also expect the disease to progress more because we know that lung function decline after each exacerbation. So both of those points make you think that the time will reduce between each accreditation. But I never hadn't thought of it in that way. I'd never seen data to prove it. I'd never actually seen a tutorial representation of it."
"I think the point is that with each reservation, the time interval between each one gets shorter and shorter."
It's emphasizing the importance of making sure that COPD patients on the appropriate treatment that they can be on to reduce the exacerbation frequency.
"So the graph on the left is telling you that the higher the eosinophil count, if they're not on ICS, the higher the exacerbation rate. And for those that are on ICS, then the risk is lower compared to those that are on ICS. Also the risk doesn't increase as exacerbation doesn't increase despite the eosinophil count going up. Which is not something I've thought about actually, it's not something that I've come across. That second point is quite interesting. The first point is very clear, it's acknowledged  inaudible 01:05:59 , it's recognized. But the second point, I haven't thought of it in that way if I'm honest."
"N is saying that in those with an elevated eosinophil count, then they should be on the ICS to reduce the risk of exacerbations."
"I think it's all consolidating basically. It's also, if you optimize treatment of COPD patients and unlike the emphasis on nonpharmacological management, basically pulmon limitation, and also smoking cessation, very important as well as pharmacological management."
"Yeah, I think I would like to look into that actually.   01:09:36 . Because I don't think it's a head to head trial. I think they just pulled trials together and put it in  inaudible 01:09:48 ."
"The critical point is I think combination of different treatment approaches or managing approaches is important, not just inhalers. So, including smoking cessation,  inaudible 01:10:28 , each one is as important as one another."
"So, sorry. Repeat the question, I didn't understand it."
"I think so, I think absolutely yeah. The way the data has been presented is systematic. It's quite strong. There's different data that's been presented about cardiovascular morbidity, such as lung function decline all of these very strong mortality data."
"Yeah. It is all right. It's just quarter past. Is it all right if you give me two minutes because I've got something else I need to do just bare with me two minutes  inaudible 01:12:35 . (Silence). Sorry, can you hear me?"
Sorry about that. You want me to look at the slides?
"So for the triple fixed dose combination, yeah?"
It's definitely an option. Can you just go back to the mortality. Yeah that one.
"Yeah, this one here. Just want to look at that one. So actually the total cardiovascular mortality between product X and ICS/LABA, which you're saying were all causes of itself. I mean, the data seems positive. Again, I would want to look at the data myself in my own time."
"So it does definitely makes you think about optimizing treatment. And answer your question, it is compelling."
I think lower mortality and level exacerbations are more important.
"I mean, at the moment, the people that I would use this drug in are those who are already on ICS/LABA/LAMA in a different. I would use this drug and this is my current practice, in people that are already on some kind of combination of ICS/LABA and LAMA. They may be taking two different inhalers or not necessarily one. And I would switch them over to a single inhaler. That's assuming that they need the ICS. So those are people that are already on an ICS, I would just switch them to another. And this given that this is another fixed dose, like trimbow and trilogy, this would also be in my options. And then the other people that I would start it on is people who are exacerbating despite LABA/LAMA. I would switch them over to this device."
"It may do, but if I'm honest, I would wait to see what the gold guidelines say about it and whether they would advocate starting triple therapy earlier."
"I think there may be. Yeah, I think, but I think what we probably want to see as a respiratory scientific community is to see this data replicated, not just with product X but with other triple therapy. I mentioned in this."
Yep. What is the focus of these slide sets? What is the focus?
"I think less so. I think B is very important slide, but probably less so relevant to this specific focus on this. I take that out."
I think we've already made the point that cardiovascular mortality and COPD are closely associated and that there's a higher risk of death. I think there's too many slides probably expressing the point. The focus of the presentation is not that. The focus is about exacerbation and the importance of reducing risk of exacerbations. So I don't want to label the point too much.
Key messages are that exacerbations associates with poor outcomes such as mortality and reduced lung function and risk of future exacerbations. And it's important to try to reduce the risk of exacerbations  inaudible 01:28:26 .
"Hello, and thank you. And I'll have the doctor in the line. Angelina, you may go ahead."
"Sorry, you just broke up there. So you have to report what in the conversation, sorry?"
"Right. So it's quite a... What's the word? I suppose, you'd say lower social sector. That population   00:03:00  outside."
"Yeah. So town, I would say. But it's fairly poor area with quite a lot of pathology, lots of smoking, lots of COPD, lots of lung cancer in the area. I think we are the third poorest CCG in England, I think, in terms of the population wealth."
"So I will see them as they come through the door as it was. So patients can book appointments with the GP initially on the telephone. And if they obviously need a face to face appointment, we get them in for that. And we help to manage their symptoms on an acute basis that way."
"Our practice also tries to manage them in a proactive way as well with long term conditions, clinics where our practice nurse will schedule six or 12 monthly reviews with COPD patients as best they can to review their medications, and tweak them as they go along. There's also a COPD team, respiratory team in the local area who help to manage these patients on an acute basis with their team, specialist nurses. So they're actually the first part of care for all COPD patients is actually to call that COPD team."
"And then the COPD nurses can come out and see them if necessary, or they can deal with them in their clinic, or on the phone to get them antibiotic and steroids and whatever it is they need. And they also get reviews in their clinic as well from time to time with the consultants."
"I'd say that's probably what I would get to deal with personally, in terms of them actually calling up with COPD, an acute COPD. So exacerbation, that's what I was thinking when I wrote that down. So it's an approximate number. There may be a little bit more than that actually come to, thinking about it now. But yeah, that's probably between 20 and 30, I would say."
"Onto their inhalers, you mean? Or do you mean for acute examinations?"
"Oh, I see. Okay. The initial diagnosis would be made in the COPD clinic. So anybody who's suspected of a COPD, we would refer to the respiratory clinic for spirometry, that's run generally by specialist nurses, overseen by respiratory consultants. They always request a chest x-ray as well for the referral. They perform a spirometry, and then they would make the diagnosis of COPD from that. And then they usually initiate at that point, recommendations for the inhalers."
"After that, they then have reviews with our practice nurse in our COPD long term medical clinics where the district nurse, well, sorry, where the practice nurse reviews how they're doing on their inhalers. And if they're struggling, they would then start to tweak the dose and then gradually work them up according to their guidelines that they follow, until finally they... If they're struggling on dual therapy, then they'll eventually get them onto trouble therapy. And each dosage change... If the practice nurse is not a prescribed, but then each dose changes is run through one of the doctors at our surgery. If they are prescribers, then they are able to do it themselves."
"Oh, the figures that we estimated the other day... Fixed dose. Yeah. So we thought about 20% of our patients."
"I think it can take them a while to get there, because they gradually worked up in strength and combinations of inhalers over time. And if they're only having reviews with our nurse every six months or 12 months, sometimes for some patients, depending on how keen they are to come in, then it can take a little while to get them worked up in strength."
"What do you mean, if anybody's come to speak to us about COPD in general?"
"Yeah. Well, from what I've experienced so far, I can't say that there's been any specific emphasis on it. However, what I would say is that obviously over the last couple of years, they've been quite extraordinary. So any large or mass group discussions that we may have had with other GPs in the area, or any conferences that we might have been to ordinarily, they've not happened. So I'm saying in the last couple of years, I haven't come across much chat, but then there hasn't really been much chat about anything as far as I've had experience."
"So are we talking about the information that's on it, or the layout of the actual page? So do you want me to comment on the information that's on the page, or how it's been laid out?"
"Yeah, so I was just checking. Are you wanting me to comment on the actual information that's on there? Or did you want me to comment on the layout of it?"
"The impression. Yeah. Okay. So the impression is that COPD is clearly a significant condition affecting many people all over the world, and it's a serious condition as it obviously results in a lot of emergency admissions. But that's my initial take home message from that. And there are obviously lots of people out there who have COPD, but we don't know about, so potentially the numbers are much bigger than what we know about at the moment."
"The fact that over half people with COPD are undiagnosed, that's quite a big number. Essentially, quite a lot of people that are missing out on treatment there."
"Well, I suppose if they're not going to see their doctors about it, especially in the early stages of COPD, they may not realize that they really have a problem. When they go and see the doctor..."
"Well, I was just going to say, it could be construed that some of the symptoms could be asthma because they could be dealt with in an asthma sort of a way, rather than under a COPD diagnosis. Obviously, some people get referred to tests and don't go for their tests as well. So there's that to think about too."
"Yes. I could believe that it could be that number from what I see. Yeah. There's heavy smoking in our area. So yeah, there's potential that a lot of them could be missed."
"Yeah, absolutely. It's a big thing in our area. Definitely."
"For relevance? Yeah, that's a seven I'd say."
"Well, just with it being quite a prevalent thing in our area, it's anything that can help to improve awareness of the need for better management to COPD, I think is a good thing."
So I'm just taking it in.  inaudible 00:21:28 
"Okay. So the thing that strikes me here is that the UK does seem to be quite heavily burdened by COPD compared with the likes of Canada, who... Obviously they have it, but it seems to be much less so."
"Yeah. To be honest, the most interesting thing for me is how much it does vary over the world. And it doesn't necessarily seem to be a huge pattern that's shown there. So the other thing is that the rest of Europe doesn't seem to be nearly as bad as the UK either."
"I think that's probably the most useful thing that I can see, most interesting thing that I can see there. Sorry."
"Yeah. I think it is. I think there must be something that we can learn from other countries very close to us, as to things that they may be doing better to avoid COPD rather than the numbers that we are seeing."
"Well, in terms of death associated with COPD, yeah."
"I'm not entirely sure. The box on the bottom right, where it says, increased likelihood of health related issues. I'm not quite sure what that's relating to. That doesn't seem to be relating to any color key coding on the map or anything."
"I see, sorry. I thought that was trying to relate to the map, but that's fine."
"It is relevant, but I think on this slide, it makes this particular slide quite busy and it might be better as a separate slide maybe."
Okay.  inaudible 00:27:04  impact on patients.
"So the take away message is that... For me, there are lots of exacerbations, moderate or severe exacerbations which patients experience. And a lot of them aren't... There's a decent proportion of them which are not even reported."
But this is clearly going to have an effect on their overall quality of life in the long term.
"No, I'm not surprised, to be honest. From the patients that I see, it probably would fit. Yeah. And I would see how some patients would want to try and battle through the symptoms before they try and seek help, whether that's down to the ease of, on whether they can get help or, or at least their perceived ease of as to whether they can get help quickly or not. That might have an influence on the numbers that are not reported. But yeah, I can believe what that slide's saying."
"Yeah. I think that's what I was trying to say there. Yeah, in my experience, I think, this could be going on, quite possibly."
Yep. That works for me. That works for me. I think that's a good visual on what it's trying to say.
No. No. I think this is quite a clear slide.
"Yeah. I mean, it seems like a high number, but it's very believable. Especially if you have moderate or severe COPD. Seems like a lot of ours have exacerbations every year rather than over a three year period. So that's very believable for me. Hello. Are you still there?"
It might be my signal. The weather is horrendous here at the moment. So it might be because of that.I've got a very good signal at the minute.
"Yeah, I was saying then when the  inaudible 00:32:00  drops... So yeah, that's very believable for me. It seems at our place, anybody with moderate or severe COPD, they seem to have exacerbations every year rather than just over a three year period. So it seems like a high number, but it's very believable for me from what I see."
No. That's nice slide for me. I think that's quite nice and clear.
"Relevance-seven, credibility-six, and motivation-six again."
"Disease progression following exacerbation. Unfortunately, not recover to pre exacerbation.  inaudible 00:33:55 ."
Alright. Okay. So seems that exacerbations can't cause an accelerated lung function decline.
"So I think the most striking thing of this is how relatively quickly those with mild COPD can actually have their lung function decline over time, compared with some of the others. But also the fact that your lung function doesn't actually come back to pre-exacerbation status after exacerbation."
"Yeah, a little bit. The fact that it doesn't come back to pre-exacerbation level is a little bit of a surprise for me. Sort of 50-50. It's a bit of a surprise, but you could believe it as well kind of thing."
"It doesn't say what percentage, I guess, of their lung function they're dropping over that period of time. So although it might look like a wide drop in terms of percentage, it'll be in a percentage of their... Relates to the normal line of decline. It'd be interesting to see that."
"Yes, it is. That it drops that much. But it can drop that much in a year. And it's also interesting that... I suppose if you compare the moderate and severe, they seem to drop by the same amount."
"It's probably suggesting that you ought to get on top of their management early to stop that initial big drop, if at all possible."
"Recalling one to acute exacerbations, patients are... Within five years... Within three years, risk  inaudible 00:39:31  was increased by  inaudible 00:39:39 ."
"So that's saying numbers of exacerbations is heavily linked to mortality. Obviously, if you can prevent exacerbations, you can significantly improve that."
"Yeah, I think so. A lot of the figures on here are surprising to me actually, on this. I wouldn't have thought two exacerbations would increase mortality by 80% in over the next year. I think if we saw that at our practice, we'd be losing quite a lot of our patients more than we are."
Given the amount of exacerbation that they have. That's interesting.
This one doesn't seem to fit with what we see.
"That surprising for me as well. That surprises me too. Following one to two acute exacerbations, half of them are dead within five years. That doesn't seem to fit with our population who just seems to exacerbate all the time."
Probability of surviving... Over  inaudible 00:42:09 . Over five years.
Yeah. It does seem quite a steep drop in terms of probability of survival. Yeah.
In terms of  inaudible 00:42:59  from the UK clinical practice research  inaudible 00:43:01  10 years of follow up based on just  inaudible 00:43:11  12 months prior to 12 months  inaudible 00:43:18  12 months during case control study.
Yeah. It seems like a lot of patients were studied and they're all from the UK. Aren't they?
"I suppose, of the patient surveyed, were they taken from a range of different socio economic backgrounds, or were they all from one same area? That sort of thing I think I'd like to know."
Excuse me. Sorry. I've got somebody at the front door.
The dog won't stop barking. Mind if I answer it?
"Hi. You want to come in and grab him? I'm just on a meeting call, if that's okay. Yeah, Thanks so much."
"Sorry, just bear with me for two seconds."
Right. What question do I want to answer by this?
"I don't know, just because the numbers just seem quite surprising compared to what I feel that I see on a day to day basis."
Okay. So I didn't realize that there was a 40% increased risk of stroke following exacerbation.
Up to a year after...  inaudible 00:48:00 .
"Right. Okay. But both of those points are interesting actually. The 40% increase in risk of stroke, and then the risk of cardiovascular events for up to a year afterwards seems to be quite a big increase in risk as well. Those are interesting."
"Yeah. I suppose it is quite believable from what I see. Like I said, I hadn't realized the actual figures, but the figures are interesting. I think, certainly believable."
The most interesting bit for me was that 40% increased risk of stroke in the first   00:49:41  days afterwards.
I don't know. Just a feeling I get from it.
" inaudible 00:50:59  atrial fibrillation and heart failure, diabetes, which was in..."
"Yeah. Okay. So there, well, take home is that COPD plus any other significant medical condition greatly increases your risk of mortality."
No. I think this is saying a bit more obvious stuff.
Yeah. It is easy to understand. I don't think it's saying anything particularly new.
Yeah. What it's saying is relevance. Yeah. I just think what it's saying is relative to the other slides that we've had before. I think what it's saying is relatively obvious.
"Yeah. I'm just thinking. So it does seem like a high number of people who have both cardiovascular disease and moderate COPD die of the actual heart condition rather than the COPD. And it looks like it is more in that category than those with severe COPD and cardiovascular disease. So if your COPD is not as bad, quite a lot of them actually died of cardiovascular causes rather than the COPD. I'm guessing once he gets to severe stage, then maybe it's more of the COPD that's actually affecting them."
"That it's important to be aware of cardiovascular issues around COPD patients, as well as just focusing on the COPD."
"Yeah, absolutely. I suppose once someone gets to the moderate stage of COPD, they are much more likely to have other issues related to smoking. So   00:55:49  cardiovascular issue. Yeah."
"So death and events are potentially driven by shared risk factors and the impact of exacerbations, driven by shared risk factors. Right. Possible  inaudible 00:56:58 ."
"Right. Hyperinflation, hypoxemia, tachycardia increased cardiac..."
"So it's saying how exacerbations cause the hyperinflation, hypoxemia and tachycardia, which then exacerbate any cardiac disease that's already present, and therefore increases the risk of cardiac events."
"I would say that'd be a slightly new way of thinking, I would say for this. Yeah."
"Yeah, absolutely. I think, yeah. Bringing... Highlighting the link to cardiac issues I think is an important thing. It's probably a link that maybe a lot of doctors are maybe not aware of. So, yeah."
"Yeah, so seven, I would say. And then what's the second one again?"
... best predictor of future exacerbation  inaudible 00:59:22 . High risk of exacerbating.
"Right. Okay. So this thing, if you can predict somebody's going to have an exacerbation, then obviously you can then try, and you've got more chance of trying to prevent it."
"Yeah. That's something, I was just going to comment on that. Yeah, the eosinophil counts. I didn't realize that. You'd fit that... I suppose eosinophil counts have been more associated with maybe asthma in the past. I didn't associate the link so much with COPD."
"Now each exacerbation accelerates the rate of subsequent exacerbations further increasing the risk of premature  inaudible 01:00:56  yeah. The first severe exacerbation, the time between subsequent exacerbation shorten..."
Yeah. This would fit with what I've seen.
"Yeah. Okay. So if you've had exacerbations in the past, you're more likely to exacerbate again, but also more within a shorter period as well."
"Yeah. This all fits with one I've seen. Yeah. And if you've had exacerbation before, you're more likely to  inaudible 01:01:52 ."
"No. The length of time sure thing isn't really a new thing. It's probably something that we have seen a lot of. It's interesting to see that the length of time between the first and second, and the second and third drops by quite a large amount. So that's the interesting thing out of that right hand side."
" inaudible 01:02:59  Not treated with an ICS and contrasting... Management, best treatment annual exacerbation rate."
Right. Okay. Do not increase the patient's treatment  inaudible 01:03:21  regardless.
"So, that's interesting to see the amount of reduction in annual exacerbations that you get if you treat with inhaled corticosteroids with people with a high eosinophil counts. However, if you don't, obviously their exacerbations do seem to go up."
"Difficult to say, I guess, because we're not really focused on eosinophil counts before."
Yep. Treatment Optimization in probable key areas can help transform the care of patients with COPD.  inaudible 01:05:02 .
"Yeah, so obviously you're saying if you could identify patients with COPD earlier and actually through phenotyping of them identify their risk and the ones that are most at risk, then obviously you can then target those guys more and earlier, to try and reduce mortality from COPD."
And I noticed there's obviously different... You need a combination of different things to try and help reduce exacerbations as COPD. And it's interesting that you can reduce the moderate or severe exacerbations by 30% using triple therapy versus a dual. And that's compared with only 22% smoking sensation.
"Yeah. I didn't think it would be as powerful, or more powerful than smoking cessation. But I say that is a new message."
"Okay. Let me think the educational message. So the link between COPD and cardiovascular disease is great. The need to prevent exacerbations is also important and preventing them in the first place, in early on can potentially improve people's prognosis for quite a long time after. And that triple therapy being that much more effective than the dual therapy is interesting."
"Potentially, yeah. It seems to suggest... And the other thing was the link with eosinophils as well. That was interesting as well. So yes, I think it would potentially change the way you look at things. Obviously we've got to follow certain guidelines, in terms of costs and things, in terms of prescribing. So we're often guided as to what we can prescribe at what time, but yeah, it was certainly trigger discussion over."
"Right. Okay. So, well, it's a model estimated annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbation  inaudible 01:10:46 ."
Right. 48% reduction versus  inaudible 01:12:01 . Yeah.
So can I just go... Do you just go back one slide?
This was moderate exacerbations against ICS and LABA. So that didn't make much of a difference there.
"And can you just show me the first one that you showed me again, please? The first one of this set. Right."
"That's the one. Yeah, that's great.  inaudible 01:13:52 ."
"I'm just trying to point out because it is interesting that on this slide, it shows a 13% reduction versus ICS lab. But on the last slide, it didn't really show much difference."
On the last slide that you showed me. On the final slide Z.
"No. Sorry. The one previous to this one, sorry. The second to last. Yeah. On here it doesn't seem to show much of a difference against ICS LABA at all. Does it?"
  01:14:51  A big reduction  inaudible 01:14:54 .
"Oh, I see. Yeah. With no recent history with that. Sorry. Yes. No recent history of   01:15:25  yeah."
"Yeah, right. In that case, I think in people with no history of exacerbations, the ICS LABA seems to be about the same, but in those who are exacerbating, maybe getting them onto triple therapy sooner rather than later appears to be improving their outcomes. And also people with high eosinophil levels as well, whether they have been exacerbating or not. So I think that seems to work for them too."
"It should be available to those with the moderate COPD as well as the severe, I think."
Why would I keep C? I think it nicely shows the downward spiral of what exacerbations cause.
I'm not so sure about this. So I think they might need to give a bit more of the information on-
"And yeah, that links to the last one. So I suppose you have the last one. You put this one in as well. Yeah."
Brilliant time. Yes. Which was frequency exacerbations... Yep. That's relevant.
Yeah. I think the most interesting thing for me was the eosinophils thing. I hadn't seen the link there before.
"Oh, right. Yeah. I suppose if they made it possibly as cheaply as possible, so the most number of patients will be able to benefit from it."
"Potentially. Yeah. It might be that we would introduce a blood test into the review of COPD patients to see what their eosinophils are like. And obviously anybody who comes back with high eosinophils, we may think about more quickly increasing their, well changing their medications to include an ICS, rather than just an inhaler without the corticosteroids."
Right. Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.
"So I'm a cardiologist working in the Northwest part of the UK. I do general cardiology, but also interventional cardiology. I've been working as a consultant for 12 years. I work in a secondary care hospital and  inaudible 00:03:22  population of just over half a million."
"They're all aged over 18. In fact, they're always over 16 actually, and up to extremes of age and they have all breadth of cardiology problems from  inaudible 00:04:06 , angina, heart failures, arrhythmias, blackouts, chest pain, breathlessness, full array of conditions."
"We have about 35-40% ethnic minority population, mix of social class, class one to class five, probably the diabetes is about 35%. CKD is maybe 15%. So we're kind of a mixed population, but certainly a high risk population in the form that we have three of the 10 highest rates of cardiovascular disease in the UK."
"Oh, probably 70-80% of them have some other comorbid conditions rather than just having a straight heart disease."
Probably diabetes and chronic immune disease.
"Diabetes, cause it's major risk factors, heart disease, and major risk factors for having adverse outcomes for many heart procedures or heart medications or heart treatments that we give. In terms of CKD, again, it increases the prevalence or the risk of the patient having heart disease and also makes it harder for us to treat their heart disease because their risk of further problems is so high."
"Well, I'm involved or look after their heart disease. And I may either add in or modify some of their treatment for their diabetes, if many of the diabetic medications can have a cardiovascular indication. So we may kind of optimize the medication or we certainly may make the diabetic team or the diabetic specialist nurse aware of the patient's kind of current status so that they can be optimized from that point of view. So we probably try our best to optimize their comorbidity if we are able to, or we get specialist input to get that sorted out."
"It depends. For the diabetes, we have the diabetic specialist nurse and the diabetologist may have some input, but it's mainly the diabetic specialist nurse. We make recommendations to the GP to either review the medication or optimize the medication or via diabetic specialist nurse, really managing the community diabetes. So it's usually the community specialist nurse and diabetes. So we'll kind of act on that and deal with that."
"I wouldn't be really actively following up their diabetes. If they come back to the cardiology clinic and their diabetes is still poorly controlled, I might make the GP aware of it rather than doing anything about it myself."
"So we have medications. This is the SGLT2 inhibitors, which are effective diabetic therapies but also have an increase in cardiovascular indication. So we're certainly happy and comfortable using those medications on diabetic patients."
"Yeah, mainly we're introducing it from a cardiovascular indication because they'd come to cardiology, so we would start it. And also sometimes if we try to optimize their risk profile, we might introduce it to try and improve things."
"In that medication, I would just prescribe it myself."
"And the diabetologist may have already considered it, but I would just prescribe it myself."
"I suppose there are lipids. They would probably be the two big areas, but I mean certainly the lipids we would manage and some aspects of the diabetes, I wouldn't say we would  inaudible 00:11:10 , certainly do something about it. They would be the main too."
"I mean, that's a very common scenario that we have to deal with. It can be multitude of different causes and usually more than one cause. It depends if they're coming to the clinic and we're seeing them on a more chronic collective basis or whether they're come acutely short of breath."
"If they're come acutely, then they may have other investigations which either point in the direction of it being due to their heart or maybe due to their lungs or maybe due to some other pathology, depending what the results of their tests are. And if they've been seen in the clinic, their GP may have done some baseline investigations or may feel that this is more now in their lungs, although it may be neither, maybe both. And it may be that we don't establish the exact reason why they are breathless. It has such a long list of possible causes. And sometimes we don't find the reason."
"I mean, if they come to a cardiologist, then the cardiologist, the first thing they're going to do is exclude the heart related issues. But obviously if I see a patient on it and it sounds very much lung related rather than their heart, then I may either ask that one of the lung specialists see them, or I may do some basic lung investigations whilst waiting for the lung specialist to see them."
"I mean, it depends on the description, really. Some of them, many of them may already have an established diagnosis of chronic obstructive airway disease. And I feel that there's no acute cardiac or there's no cardiac issue that's causing a symptom and it's most likely to be just lung and I might  inaudible 00:14:02  a lung function test or do a chest x-ray. It really depends on their symptoms, really, and the type of breathlessness that were describing, et cetera. And that may prompt me to do particular tests to either confirm or exclude their heart as the cause."
"I think if they've got known lung disease and their symptoms don't sound heart related, definitely. If they've got a  inaudible 00:14:41  on heart disease, then I think that it's more likely to be their lungs. If they have previously seen the lung specialist or they're under the lung team and they've been sent to the heart team sometimes in error or for a second opinion, I might ask the lung specialists to see them then, if I don't think it's their heart. So I think they would be the main scenarios."
"Yeah. I mean, we certainly have to consider the lungs in terms sometimes the medication that we use may affect their lungs. So we have to be kind of conscious if they've got lung disease to make sure that we're not going to make their lung disease worse. And that would probably be the main thing that makes me conscious of the lung disease. And also, I suppose, whether we're treating the right thing and whether it's just their lung disease that's causing the problem and not their heart."
"Yeah. I mean the lung disease could exist. Well, the cardiac condition could exist because of the lung disease. Like they've got pulmonary hypertension, right? Heart failure. We may think that's all cause of lung disease, but then the lung disease could be preexisting or exist independent of the patient having heart disease. So sometimes it's hard to say that the two are linked or sometimes it's hard to say that the two are separate."
"If I was happy that the heart was not the problem, depending on the scenario, I might, if they're a hospital, might ask the respiratory nurse to see them and they can assess them and decide if they feel that they need to see the lung team."
"If I see them in the clinic, I may either ask them to go back to the GP and say, ""I think this is the lung,"" and the GP can either manage along with managed COPD in the community, or if they feel that they're not able to manage that they may ask a respiratory physician to see them, or if I feel the breathing is particularly bad or the GP is not really being proactive about things, I might just refer them straight to a lung physician, but I don't think lung physicians are particularly interested in COPD. So I suppose we  inaudible 00:18:16 ."
"Probably around a third, because maybe two thirds of  inaudible 00:18:38 . So probably a third at least."
It would probably be at least a quarter.  inaudible 00:18:57  respiratory diagnosis.
"As I mentioned, only if the patient has... if we're trying to get them some medication and we feel that their COPD may be too significant, too severe for them to be able to tolerate some of the medications  inaudible 00:19:43  that I want to use. So if that's the case, then we may be thinking of the COPD, but it's kind of so common mainly in these patients that I'm  inaudible 00:19:54 ."
"To be honest, I don't really delve much into their COPD management in terms of  inaudible 00:20:15 . I mean, we might start them with the antibiotics if they've got chest infection, or I'll give them if they're in hospital and they're very wheezy, but other than that, I don't get involved in the inhaled therapies because I'm not really up to date in terms of the different medications that are available in that the area. So I'll leave the respiratory nurse to do that."
"Only if that's the primary problem and they don't have any heart disease. Well, the heart disease is kind of very minor, but they're in the cardiology ward because of the COPD. Then we would've to manage the COPD, but it's not a common thing."
"Yeah, that tends to be a common reason why they're in hospital with their breathlessness, and so we would manage that and we would all probably be able to manage that."
"Yeah, I mean, we would probably give them some nebulizers and give them some steroids and maybe give them some antibiotics, depending if we feel an infection there. So we would manage the kind of acute side of things, but then allow the respiratory team to give their input, and the respiratory nurses for the further optimization of therapy when they go back to the community, but we would manage the acute side of things."
I would tend to leave them on their same inhalers or I might give them some nebulizers or give them some steroids. I wouldn't do probably much more than that.
"Sorry, do I ask about that? I don't ask about it. No.   00:22:47 "
"Well, I think the etiology of both is very... it overlaps."
Smoking is obviously a big cause of COPD and is a big cause of heart disease. So patients who smoke tend to have both or have a high likelihood of having both of those conditions. So there's a fairly big overlap there.
"Subsequently, COPD can lead to right heart failure. So smoking and lung disease can lead to increases in lung cancer, which can cause cardiovascular rhythm problems. Similarly, the medications for COPD, sometimes some of them can increase the likelihood for developing tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. So I think there is an overlap partly cause the etiology of both is a common etiology."
"All right. I said the etiology for both COPD and cardiovascular disease tend to be... smoking is a big one. And So there's an overlap in terms of the cause of both. They tend to coexist, and I can't remember the other part of the question was really sorry."
"Right, sorry. I think partly the relationship between the two or the direct kind of link between the two is because the etiology of COPD is smoking and smoking is a big risk. That's for having heart disease. So that's the kind of big interplaying relationship."
"But also, some of the medications that you might use for COPD in terms of inhalers increase the likelihood of arrhythmias,  inaudible 00:25:44  atrial fibrillation and atrial tachycardia or sinus tachycardia. And similarly, smoking can increase risk of lung cancer and COPD. And that can increase the risk of developing other cardiovascular problems such as pericardial effusions. So there is overlap, but a lot of it is based on the etiology."
"I don't think it really improves the cardiovascular risk, given that the etiology of the COPD tends to be smoking and they usually may have stopped, but  inaudible 00:26:35  the effects of the smoking are not going to go away. And managing the COPD is mainly managing the symptoms of the COPD rather than... there's no cure, really, for that. So I don't think that really ultimately improves their cardiovascular risk unless smoking cessations kind of, which I suppose is part of COPD management, managing that would improve or reduce the progression of their cardiovascular risk. But I wouldn't say it improves it."
"I think, similarly, if we manage the cardiovascular disease better, depending on what the symptoms they get from it are, if they're getting less because of their heart disease, they may feel better from their COPD point of view, but mainly because their possibly, because the symptoms of their were thought to be COPD or mainly more possibly heart related, rather than prolong the COPD. So I think managing their heart disease doesn't make their COPD better, but they might feel like it's better."
"Not in terms of the COPD, but in terms of the medication with the COPD, there are lots of inhalers and nebulizers, and they're on steroids that might increase the risk of hypertension or rhythm problems, which might make their heart disease... they might make them more symptomatic from the heart disease or make the heart disease worse."
"Other than the symptoms, but the actual physiology of the COPD I don't even think has much bearing on the heart."
"Well, I suppose the main take is that patients with COPD commonly die because of cardiovascular disease and in the four studies that are there is a mix of different causes of death, but cardiac and  inaudible 00:30:09  too common, but it probably maybe less frequently than actual COPD... If you average that it's probably similar, but certainly these patients with COPD are not just dying a lung disease."
"Yeah, I think that's probably a fair number and I think it boils down to the common etiology of both conditions, really. So I'm not sure whether the death in these patients, whether the COPD has caused their cardiovascular disease or whether the cause of the COPD has caused their cardiovascular disease. So what the causal link is, is the etiology. So the etiology will be one of the links linking the two arms on the actual lung disease itself."
"Not much differently. I mean, we know it's a chronic long term condition, it will cause mortality... cancer, obviously, is a major cause of death in these patients. A lot of them will develop lung cancer. And we know that a lot of them have heart disease and that heart disease maybe, well, that heart disease will commonly cause their death as well. And it's cause the two of them are coexisting, I think."
"Well, I think similar to the previous one that patients with COPD have, there's a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in these patients and, well, we've got a greater risk of developing heart disease. Again, probably boiling down to the etiology of COPD and heart disease, being very common and being, and being a common etiology in terms of smoking. And it increased risk of mortality than COPD alone, and they have an increased risk of mortality. And those patients who have COPD cardiovascular condition tend to have a higher mortality."
"Yeah, I mean, it suggests that the COPD is a big adverse risk factor for their mortality, compared to kind of the CV condition. So the COPD is kind of an important aspect or important drive for their mortality. And it suggests that you need to pay attention to it."
"I suppose the only thing that would be that is a little surprising is the numbers, but the range of the numbers is very, very wide there. 30 to 90%, then 40 to 140%. That's a massive range basically. So I don't know how reliable those data are because the 95% confidence in thought is very, very wide, adjusting it."
"No. Again, I think some of this is consequence of the etiology and we don't have any treatments for cure for the patients. We treat their symptoms for COPD.  inaudible 00:35:10 , rather than being able to give them something that's going to make the COPD go away."
"Okay. So just that COPD exacerbation obviously has a high morbidity and mortality and not just from their lung disease, but also the risk of cardiovascular complications, which is again, such as data, which I'm not really familiar with and it forms a risk of stroke within 10 days. So, I mean, it seems interesting data, I suppose it depends on how they define myocardial infarction in this."
"Yeah. I mean, there's five different types of the definition of myocardial infarction. If these are patients who've had an exacerbation of their COPD, many of them may just have an enzyme rise, which is labeled as an MI rather than having to treat a myocardial infarction."
"We commonly see a type two MI in patients with COPD or it's certainly not unexpected because they get hypoxic during their COPD exacerbation. And many of them have coexisting cardiovascular disease, so they may have a type two myocardial infarction. So that's why the definition of the MI is quite important."
"Well, again, I mean, it boils down to the definition. If it's just an enzyme rise, then that's not so moving, because it's not unexpected because they're hypoxic during the COPD exacerbation. That causes kind of an ischemia demand mismatch within the heart, which can cause an enzyme rise, which may be labeled as an MI. So that instance would be high after the COPD exacerbation. That's not unexpected, so to speak. So if they're talking type one MI, then that's bit more eye opening, but if it's type two, then that's not something we don't see in practice."
"Yeah. I mean, that is interesting. I note that incidences going up after six days. So I don't understand, there's no information whether these have hemorrhagic strokes or ischemic strokes. Some of these patients may be put with steroids, which may even cause hypertension, which could increase the risk of stroke or may cause bleeding... the type of stroke the patient's getting is probably relevant. Why is the risk going up?"
"Well, it could be a contributing factor. Yeah. I think it's simple saying there's not COPD exacerbation. It increases risk of stroke in terms of the... it's just the exacerbation itself. So the medication they may have had as a consequence could increase the risk of stroke. They may have been given blood thinners because they were immobile, which could increase the risk of a bleed. So there's lots of associations or things that could cause them to have stroke as a consequence of COPD exacerbation."
"I think, I mean, what that suggests to me, if they're moderate rather than severe, it would suggest that the COPD exacerbation itself is not the kind of the cause de facto, because it's only a moderate event, so to speak, in terms of COPD. So it may be other factors. So they may have a moderate exacerbation of COPD, but that might cause them to have atrial fibrillation, which could cause them to get a stroke because they've got respiratory tract infection."
"So that again... it isn't the COPD exacerbation that's causing them to have atrial fibrillation, which is something that we see, and that might cause them to have the stroke. Again, it could be days later. So the moderate exacerbation suggests to me that it's not, well, it's not severe COPD exacerbation to whether the causation here is not linked to the actual COPD exacerbation itself."
"Certainly your suspicions may be higher. These patients have got moderate... they've been given steroids, they've been given antibiotics. So they've obviously had an exacerbation, but they're not required to intravenous antibiotics. They've not said whether they've their chest x-rays have been abnormal, et cetera. But it'd be interesting to see whether the data is similar in severe and in mild exacerbations. Are the trends still there or are they flat lines in those two? Are they mild? Is it completely independent  inaudible 00:41:47  stroke completely unrelated?"
"I mean, the information, without knowing what the details of the study that they've done here, it shows that this drug X reduced the mortality compared to kind of standard therapies for COPD. Well, patients with a lot of severe COPD, combination therapy would reduce the risk of mortality up to one year."
"So, I mean, this product X reduces the risk of mortality after the four weeks significant reduction by 52 weeks compared to standard therapy for patient that doesn't say, I don't think, whether they've got an exacerbation that's COPD, but those patients with moderate to severe COPD, compared to the standard therapies. And it's a combination therapy. It's a secondary endpoint there though. So the study's not powered for that endpoint."
In terms of outcome? In terms of why they're different?
"Well, I assume it's a triple therapy. It's kind of adding on all three, in three different areas all at the same time, in terms of reducing your immune response and acting on  inaudible 00:44:38  and the muscarinic antagonist. So it's kind of a three-prong attack. So it's synergistic, they've added together to have a better outcome."
"Well, there's a few things. I mean, it's a relative risk reduction rather than an absolute risk reduction. The actual absolute difference is only from 2.5% to probably 1.3% or 1.2%. So it's a small, absolute reduction. It's not a powered study for mortality, because it's a secondary endpoint that they're reporting. So might just be a player of chance. And the confidence intervals, whilst all in the same direction, are quite wide. 0.33 to 0.80 against raising a suspicion that this may be fortuitous, but it's only something that would have to be investigated in a powered study. The actual absolute, the absolute reduction here is two and half percent to one, one point. So 1% reduction basically. I think  inaudible 00:46:10 . So it's not a very big, absolute risk reduction there."
"Yeah, I mean the number needed to treat of 80 is obviously derived from the hazard ratio in the risk reduction. So I mean the number is low. I suppose you need to treat each patients to prevent one, one mortality out to one year, but as I said, this wouldn't be a powered endpoint. So I don't know how statistically reliable this album data would be."
"From my point of view, treating these patients? It wouldn't make me do anything differently to their treatment."
"Yeah, I mean, I suppose we may think why aren't they using it? And then there's probably a good reason why they may or may not be using it. And if this is obviously all cause mortality that's been reduced, not cardiovascular mortality and looks and also... and so I'd be interested to see what the primary endpoint of this study was because we're just talking a secondary endpoint here. So there may be other issues with the product, without there being a cardiovascular label to it. I probably wouldn't get too involved in prescribing it or think about it too much."
"Okay. I mean, they've said that the major reduction here is all because of cardiovascular for product X, but the cardiovascular mortality rate is similar between product X and ICS/LABA sorry, ICS/LABA, so to speak. And their  inaudible 00:49:41  mortality is somewhat similar and the cardiovascular mortality is the same other than the kind of difference in cancer there for mortality. So they've picked obviously the LABA/LAMA as the comparison, but it doesn't do anything compared to steroids and the LABA. So maybe it's the LAMA that's the problem."
"Well, I mean, we're talking a subgroup of a subgroup here in terms of outcome, so yeah, there's a difference there, but it depends on... we're talking 14 patients out of maybe 4,000. So the number of patients we're talking about is very small, in fact, in terms of respiratory, there's obviously no difference there in the respiratory sort of thing. So we're kind of talking very small subgroups here, so I'm not sure if there's any power there to say that's causing any difference there. You could ignore the  inaudible 00:51:21  and say, well, it's the same as the other ICS and LABA, which they don't mentioned. So Why is it... it's the LAMA that's the problem, not product X. You get rid of LAMA, you actually do better."
"Yeah. I mean, the, if you look at the outcome there, they're very similar to the product X."
"They've got a higher non-fatal stroke rate with product X and CV death is obviously higher with the LAMA/LABA, which I can see from the other one and nonfatal MI. So the product X and ICS and LABA kind of performed very similarly. I mean, the difference is the overall  inaudible 00:52:42  is lower with ICS/LABA than it is with product X. We're talking more percentages. So the data would suggest to me that is the problem, the outcome of the adverse morbidity and mortality are related to the muscarinic antagonist, rather than adding all three together, get rid of the compound. The outcomes will be better."
"Well, it's surprising because it's obviously it's a product that's combining all three and it's being tested. So the product's being tested because I don't know what the outcome news would be like. 'm not familiar with the data for these kind of products, but the LAMA seems to be the problem rather than combining all three... remove one."
"So I think, yeah, obviously the number has gotten bigger because you're talking cardiovascular death against LAMA and LABA because that was quite high. But I think the interesting one is that product X shows a non-significant reduction in death compared to ICS and LABA with  inaudible 00:54:24  confidence interval there."
"So none of the comparisons there... they're all comparing the worst group, but not the similarly performing group, those two codes. There's not much of a difference there. So yeah, I mean the big numbers, but is the comparison fair? Because you're comparing it to LABA and LAMA when ICS and LABA perform better than LABA and LAMA."
"Well, I mean... you're comparing against another COPD medication, which... but when you compare it with a third COPD medication without the LAMA in, the performances is not really... there's a nonsignificant reduction there with a very wide confidence interval."
"So your comparator arm is not really a fair comparator to, say, we're comparing it to this. And we do a lot better. But you =should be comparing it to the ICS and LABA and say, if you.. because that's another treatment that people can have for heir COPD and it doesn't reduce mortality...  inaudible 00:56:03  Mortality on that bottom bit, but it's not reducing the mortality. There's no significant mortality reduction versus that, but they've not chosen to compare it,"
"Well, I'm not sure of the validity of this, of the strength of the data here..."
"Because this, now this might just be play of chance. So what you're talking about less than 1%, and we're talking about subgroup of mortality in the second point, and then you talking cardiovascular mortality on top of that. So this is basically data dredging, and they've found a positive outcome type of thing, rather than this was pre-specified..."
"It was probably pre-specified as a secondary endpoint, but now they've delved into it deeper, but I'm not sure there's any statistical validity there to say, give this product release your risk of cardiovascular death."
"So yeah, if you have journal at the same time."
"Well, so the first thing is you can't compare the  inaudible 00:58:34  in different studies because they're all different studies."
"On the left, we're comparing against placebo and on the right, we're comparing against another product, which as we've seen in the previous slide is kind of maybe causing more adverse events. And that means that you may get a better absolute risk reduction against a product, which kind of causes more problems than good versus placebo. So I think it's an unfair comparison because you've got placebo on one side of it and another drug, which might be kind of potent and forming poorly. But to be fair, you either to have everything against placebo, then you could say it's a bit more of a fairer assessment, but at the moment, I don't think it's a fair slide."
"Well, in the previous slide, we show that the mortality has increased with LAMA and LABA. So if you compared an ACE inhibitor, if you compared the statin to a chip diet, your absolute risk reduction would be much higher than if you compare it to placebo. So if you compare it to something that may potentially increase mortality, which they've kind of shown, then it's much easier for you to show the benefits."
"I mean, it depends on what studies they've been doing. The same population, is that randomized? I mean, the only way to tell between product X and Y is to have a randomized study with patients randomized to X or Y and seeing what the outcome is rather than comparing two different studies, maybe different type, different protocols and the outcomes. So you can't compare two different products in two different trials, and then say one is better than the other, even if the comparison is the same, because it's a different study,"
"It certainly raises and kind of asks the questions, but I don't think it's able to do much convincing for me because you're not going against placebo. It may be the comparator hat's been selected here is the one causing more adverse events in the control population rather than product X and Y being amazing products."
"Possibly. Yes. I mean, we have no way of knowing that because you don't compare the placebo. So that may be why you're getting the benefit because you're comparing against a poorer performer."
"Well, I think I mentioned before that, I think there is that link between the two mainly because of common etiology. So I think I'm happy that there is a link due to both sets of patients have similar kind of cause de facto there, and that factors whether a change in terms of whether therapies for COPD will improve mortality than a more cardiovascular mortality. They have to be kind of adequately powered studies in that population, like they've done with the SGLT2s to show that in the patients with COPD and heart disease, randomized placebo, and product X, Y, and Z or whatever, and they do better with X, Y, and Z rather than placebo. That will convince me."
"It's possible, it's possible. I think the data I've seen here hasn't shown it. I'm sure some clever person will come up with this study that shows that. Yeah."
"If you want to compare between X and Y, it would have to be head to head, but if you want to   01:05:16  in COPD patients with cardiovascular disease, they'd have to be randomized product X or placebo."
"So I'm a cardiologist. I work in the UK. I work in a secondary care institution. I do general cardiology and interventional cardiology. I see patients coming in acutely with cardiovascular symptoms and also patients who have been referred by their primary care physicians with a diagnosis of heart failure, or suspected heart failure, and lots of a variety of other cardiovascular conditions."
"Not really in terms of practice. I mean, the  inaudible 00:01:54  there is definition. I don't really use that definition on a day to day basis."
"I mean, our reports are usually, kind of labeled as severe, mild, moderate, or normal, really. So, above 50% is really probably regarded as normal, less than 35 is severe, moderate at probably 35 to 40ish. And then mild, well, sorry, moderate, probably 35 to 45 and then mild, maybe 30, 45 to 50, or kind of bit of grayness in that area. But, the severe and normal is kind of quite clear and then the moderate, mild is in the middle."
I don't think it's black and white in terms of an absolute number of personally.
"Yeah. I mean, I think that some of it boils down to the kind of the patient symptoms, and then all the markers on the echo that we might look at, BNP, otherwise you wouldn't be able to, you would never have a patient who has got no heart problems, basically, if you regarded all of them even with a normal ejection fraction as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, because there's so many overlapping conditions or overlapping causes for patients symptoms. Really. So I think the normal, if their ejection fraction is greater than 50%, I just  inaudible 00:04:25 , and there's nothing else on their record that looks abnormal and it's basically the heart looks fine."
"Otherwise, you'll never get, we can't make any progress with these patients. They're always got a condition which I think it's hard to treat and sometimes, giving them a condition might makes it harder for them to move on really, when they really don't have anything wrong with them."
"I think it's not a straightforward black and white line really between the two. And I think we, personally where I work and mostly institutions we work with, we use diastolic heart failure as something slightly easier to define with the other parameters that we've got for that in terms of TDI and EPRI and other Doppler measures. And, it's easier to define those patients. And I think personally there's probably a lot of overlap between those patients who've got diastolic heart failure and heart failure with preserved ejection refraction. Some would say they're basically the same group of patients, or there may be subtle separations from these patients. And, sometimes it's a matter of giving some of these patients a treatment without even labeling them as having, technically having heart failure because the label sometimes is the thing that sometimes, some patients it will help and some patients it doesn't help them. And that's what they all cling onto when the treatment really is not going to be deviating very, there's not much difference in the terms of the treatment that we can offer."
"Yeah. I mean I think it's, a lot of the medication that we have for them is empirical. And whether they have a label of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction or diastolic look heart failure, what we're treating their symptoms ultimately, they've got edema, we'll give them some diuretics and not having heart failure as such as a label doesn't mean you can't have a diuretic. So it doesn't close the door on them getting treatment. Because well, ultimately the treatment that we have is symptomatic treatment, obviously with the new, with the SGLT2 data, well particularly for Empagliflozin, obviously there is a potential or shown benefit in terms of giving them some-"
"There is, there is obviously some additional therapy that we can give if the patient is labeled in a particular way, but it's a kind of a challenging area where the landscape is I think, is changing. And I think there's a lot of confusion and I'll admit to myself that there's confusion from our point of view in terms of which patients we should label as having this diastolic heart failure, or do we say they have a normal heart. And I think different cardiologists will probably label these patients in a different way."
Ultimately though their treatment perhaps is very similar.
"I tend to use systolic and diastolic. Although certainly if patients have got systolic heart failure, they've got impaired left ventricular function. The other labels I have to admit, I use them as little as possible because it's a matter of, kind of labeling some of these as I've gone back, sometimes labeling the patient when it may not help them to be labeled as X. And as I said that some of the kind of categorization in terms of diastolic heart failure is a little bit gray and different people will label it in a different way. So, I think if patients got impaired early function, that's quite clear. If they've got symptoms of heart failure and their echo looks pretty normal, most of those patients have all the comorbidities and they're on the same medication."
"If they've had a BNP and they've got kind of,  inaudible 00:09:51  I thought they had heart failure before they got their echo result looking normal then they might have a greater tendency to say this patient's probably got a heart failure with preserved ejection fraction diastolic heart failure. I don't tend to label many of the other patients really. I don't think, I'm not into labels."
"I think probably a bit of both. I mean, there are certainly patients who've got impaired LV function because they've had X, Y, and Z. They've had a big heart attack. They've got impaired left ventricular function. Those patients are very different to those patients who've got a normal get fraction and heart failure or diastolic heart failure is, they're very distinctly different. There's clear myocardial impairment because of infarction. In the patients who have kind of breathlessness, and some of them have the same degree of breathlessness, but have kind of very good left ventricular function and some features of diastology. And some of those patients have  inaudible 00:11:09  from LV impairment, those patients are possibly on the same spec, have the same condition on kind of two extremes of the spectrum. So to answer your question, I think there's, depending on the etiology of their heart failure, they may be the same spectrum or they may be completely different if that makes any sense."
"I mean, as I said, in terms of ischemic cardiomyopathy, a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and impaired LV function, there's no overlap with diastolic heart failure there. The patient's got impaired LV function because they've got lots of, they've lost myocardium and those patients are not going to have had diastolic heart failure initially or preserved ejection fraction and then progressed into reduced ejection fraction. They've got a reduced ejection fraction because of infarction. So they are a distinct group. Obviously the group with, maybe due to hypertensive heart disease who may have kind of impaired left ventricular function in the last stages or the end stages, but may start off with some kind of diastolic heart failure or hypertensive, or heart failure and preserved ejection fraction. And they potentially can progress down that way, depending on how advanced their disease gets. So, the etiology, I think the main probably differentiating one is going to be ischemic and obviously dilated cardiomyopathy, those patients don't tend to have diastolic heart failure."
"But that probably the hypertensive heart disease is the age related, those ones where there is more, the kind of muscle mass is not the thing that gets lost, probably are more likely to have the range between preserved, reduced and impaired."
"I think the urgency is the same in terms of managing symptoms if patients come and present with pulmonary congestion or edema, their management is going to be the similar respect of whether they've got a normal ejection fraction or an impaired ejection fraction, they will get the same treatment. In terms of the urgency of establishing a cause, is probably again very similar. The urgency in terms of other potential prognostic medications, such as defibrillators, et cetera, there's obviously a variation there. But in terms of the symptomatic presentation, when you see them in the clinic, when you see them on the ward, if they've got breathlessness and they've got edema, they'll get diuretics and it'll be the same intensity and urgency of prescription, irrespective of what's the underlying etiology, I think."
"I suppose, I mean the nomenclature keeps changing, which obviously makes it more challenging to keep up with in terms of what people are describing, the goal posts keep changing, making it harder for primary care physicians, for cardiologists who aren't heart failure experts to fully understand what patients are being investigated in these particular studies potentially, and how relevant they are to the patient that they're seeing. So, I think for things to become easier in terms of classifying the patients in a way in which is, well, I suppose, classifying the patient in an easier way that is more reproducible or having, and we are increasing getting to the point where all the treatments that we have available for the range of patients with heart failure, respectful of their ejection fraction are kind of overlapping now. So you know, that in itself makes it easier for primary care physicians, and cardiologists and non-cardiologists to manage these patients because the collection of medications that we have are suitable for all of them, irrespective of whether their ejection fraction is 42% or 36%."
"And those kind of subtle qualitative values I think are probably not so relevant in the practice because it's an estimation on a three dimensional moving object basically, and they're always going to be variations and making a decision on the basis of a 1% difference seems ridiculous in terms of the patient's management."
"Yeah. So this guy is, okay, so he had  inaudible 00:17:38  diabetes. He's had hypertension with probably poor control. He was a pretty big chap, his BMI was around 38 and he had a progressive history of breathlessness and edema. And was seen in the clinic actually, and was admitted from the clinic because of his symptoms, and of edema, and his LV function as on the scan was kind of in the mild range, just over 45% with no other significant parameters. But there was left ventricular hypertrophy and some kind of features of diastolic dysfunction. So he was treated with kind of high dose intravenous diuretics for about 10 days and started on the, most of those medications he was actually already on because of hypertension. So-"
"Since he was given Frusemide, IV, and also Empagliflozin, which is not unreasonable anyway because he was already diabetic and led to kind of marked improvement in his symptoms. And he was investigated as well just to ensure there were no other coexisting causes for his potential symptoms and presentation, given his comorbidities of diabetes and hypertension, and I suppose raised BMI."
"Yeah, it was from the clinic and that's when his diagnosed was made."
"So, I mean, he'd been just getting progressively breathless, and having increasing swelling, and his GP had increased his Frusemide, but it had not made much impact in terms of his symptoms. And then the GP had referred him to the clinic for assessment."
"Yeah, I mean, it was basically disguised by these symptoms, clinically, you suspect the guy's got heart failure because he is breathless and he's got leg edema. But given his other comorbidities, it could have been obviously other causes. And he was asking for obviously management advice and also assessment to establish a diagnosis and to kind of enable a treatment plan."
"Yeah, he was very breathless and he had a lot of edema, and it clearly wasn't something that was going to go with tinkering with medication as an outpatient. So, it was easier to admit him and give him a higher dose aggressive diuretics."
"I mean, clinically, the clinical impression was that he has heart failure, whether it was preserved or impaired ejection fraction was essentially not really relevant at the time. It was management of his symptoms and investigate with an echocardiogram, and also did an angiogram on him given his risk factors to make sure that there was no ischemic cardiomyopathy, and his angiogram was normal actually. So, the differential was that this guy's got a heart failure. The cause being either due to a hypertension and heart coronary disease, or possibly could have been a cardiomyopathy, but suspicion was it's probably related to coronary disease and or hypertension."
"Yeah, I mean, not to the point where the patients admitted because of kind of-"
"Significant symptoms, but in terms of the presentation of progressive breathlessness, lethargy on the background of hypertension and one other kind of cardiovascular risk factor is not uncommon."
"I suppose, in terms of the patients that we see in the clinic, the proportion of patients, we obviously see a skewed population. Probably at least a third, if not half the patients that come to the clinic have got a high blood pressure and diabetes is about 35, 40% of the patients. And there's a good proportion of them are obese. So, the comorbidities that they had were not rare."
"I think hypertension is probably one of the commonest ones that we see and, obviously the patients that we see commonly have hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and they tend to be obese. So, they're the kind of patients that we tend to see anyway in the kind of the cohort of patients that we see because of that's the population that we treat. So, they're the common risk factors that these patients will have, preserved or impaired LV function."
"No. I mean, I don't think the comorbidities would necessarily direct me to think or not think of heart failure. If the presentation is with edema, tiredness and breathlessness, heart failure is the thing that I would think of high on the list, because we see plenty of patients who have no comorbidities who have heart failure but as the incidental finding for whatever reason. And similarly, we see patients with lots of comorbidities who have no heart failure. So I think the comorbidities are there just to kind of increase your suspicion, but I would not suspect it if they didn't have the comorbidities and vice versa. If they had all the comorbidities in their heart was normal, that again is not completely unheard of. So, they're there just to kind of maybe potentially direct you but they're not the, you can't not have heart failure because you've got the comorbidities and vice versa."
"Yeah, he said it was probably going on for probably four to six months."
"Yeah, I mean, I think it was something that was trying to be managed in primary care and it wasn't successfully managed in primary care because he kind of was wasn't  inaudible 00:26:40  aggressive therapy. So it was probably a multitude of progressive symptoms and suboptimal or suboptimal therapy."
"I mean, it's very variable. Some patients will tolerate their symptoms for many months and before they even see the GP and well, some patients cannot tolerate the symptoms for a day before they come to the hospital as an acute admission. So, I think there's no hard and fast rule there and it's very dependent on the patient's tolerance. And I think, I couldn't generalize that some patients will come in straight away and some patients sit at home for months and don't feel that there's any problem. I just feel that  inaudible 00:27:44  their age or what not. And won't present like this guy's kind of left it six months, but he could've presented it as an acute admission, probably three months beforehand and the treatment would've been the same. He would've been probably admitted and given high dose diuretics."
"Potentially, or they may just feel that there's, if they're not used to having kind of symptoms, they may just feel it's that they're just getting a bit older or they think they've had COVID, or could be any number of different things really. Or some people just don't want to know."
"They may not be communicating it with any healthcare provider or the fact that they've been to the GPs made a referral suggest they've actually, they've been to the GP."
"But it may have been that they've went to the GP for another reason, rather than this. There's lots of permutations there. Don't think you could generalize."
"Not necessarily. I mean, he might have been just managed in primary care with a diabetic specialist nurse, keeping an eye on his diabetes with a once yearly blood pressure check if he's had no symptoms and he is not presented to the primary care physician, he might not be seeing anyone specialist. He didn't really need any specialist input. I think his diabetes was controlled."
"I mean, it's a bit easier now if they've got poor glycemic control, I would just stick him on SGLT2. And that tends to help a little bit. And if it doesn't help, then the GP can kind of, the diabetic nurse or the GP can do something else. But, we're using so much of the SGLT2s now that these patients with normal, well, with impaired glycemic control or even normal glycemic control, we can help by giving them with an SGLT2 and then the GP can kind of follow it up. Where I'd say a year, two years ago, I would've just told the GP to look at it."
"I mean, in this guy, I think he'd had some checks on his renal function because he was on a variety of the therapies. And I think an echo had been requested, but it hadn't happened by the time we'd seen him in clinic."
"He hadn't had a BNP from what I can recall. It's not always done even though we kind of suggest it, but it's not always done."
"Well, an echo would usually be requested, but whether it's been conducted is kind of dependent on how quickly the patient's been seen in the clinic relative to when they were referred, et cetera. So, there's no kind of set rule to say that definitely would've had an echo by the time they come to see us. Usually it's in the system somewhere, but sometimes there can be delays or it takes longer for that to happen for whatever reason, the patient missed the appointment, et cetera. So it's not a prerequisite for them to come that they've had echo."
"Well, I suppose ideally they would have had obviously the full set of bloods of BNP, an ECG, and an echogram, all that would be nice at the time they're seen in the clinic, but that's unfortunately not always a reality."
Now because patients are less likely to be physically seen in primary care at the moment.
"Yeah. I mean, symptoms, the GP doesn't know what the cause of the symptoms are or has not been able to manage them adequately."
"Yeah, so he was admitted. We offloaded him. We had an echo, I did angiogram which was normal. He was discharged once we'd kind of optimized his medication and he's been put on obviously the optimal therapy, which I felt was appropriate and referred him to the community heart failure team. And I think I did an outpatient request for cardiac MRI scan, and I referred him to the community heart failure team for kind of long term monitoring."
"I mean, clinically at heart failure, he presented with edema he was breathless. So, if the echo machines, if we had no echo machine, I would label them as having heart failure, which is sometimes possibly a good way to give the patient a diagnosis of preserved or impaired LV function. If they've got a heart failure and it's just the LV function that's above or below a particular number. So, you could argue that, that's the easiest way to label some of these heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. They've got the symptoms of it, irrespective of what their echo shows. So, that was the key that the LV function was 45%. He had heart failure in terms of his clinical presentation. There was   00:36:09 -"
That we'd know of that. That we kind of label that way.
"Yeah. I mean, and similarly there'll probably, a group of patients who don't get into that kind of heart failure label. Who've probably got heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and the label is having COPD or something else. So, I think that it is very hard to make it black and white."
"It isn't black and white, unfortunately. And as things get more and more complex in kind of defining these patients, it'll get less and less black and white."
"I mean, he was on Ramipril, and the Bisoprolol, and the small dose of Frusemide."
"I mean, at rest he was kind of NYHA 1 basically. But it would be one stroke two, probably. We didn't really fully assess the extent, but he was at what, three. Probably closer to one  inaudible 00:38:52 ."
"Well, a few of my clinic colleagues, but I don't know the kind of consultants that kind of looked after him."
"I mean, for this guy kind of, I've probably suggested that his kind of presentation is probably the, as I told him, I said it's probably the long term effects of having high blood pressure, which has been poorly controlled, which is what he's got basically. So, this is a problem really of the end effects of poor blood pressure control over a number of years. Having an effect, not on the hearts pumping function as such, but more in how the heart relaxes. And that's really the cause and the treatment is what you are on and make sure your blood pressure is aggressively controlled. So, I didn't necessarily say that you've got heart failure, but I don't think I said, ""You've got heart failure."" I said, ""You've got a problem with the heart not relaxing because of your blood pressure, which has been historically high and not well controlled."" He understood because he said, ""Yeah, I can understand that it's going to cause some problems."""
"I mean, it depends obviously on that, I mean, this guy is 50 odd. He was just over 55, maybe he's 58, I think. So, he was kind of reasonably  inaudible 00:41:26  and happy to engage in conversation to find out what the problem was and what the kind of outlook is because he's relatively young. If he was 88, I think the conversation would've been very different."
"There may not be as much need to elaborate on what was going on. And obviously age would've had more of a relevant impact on his potential presentation and ongoing diagnosis, but the treatment was purely more symptomatic. And managing or balancing the aggressive treatment with the impact that it may have on his quality of life."
"For this guy, I think when we first saw him, obviously we said that the initial assumption was that you've got heart failure. But obviously once we've got his echocardiogram report, the heart function is not pumping completely normally."
But it's certainly not as bad as we first thought and it probably is more of a relaxation rather than the heart not pumping as well as normal. Which kind of gives him a little bit more optimism rather than saying your heart it's just not working.
"Especially considering his age and the fact that he's relatively young. So, some of how you pitch it, it's got to be dependent on the patient as well. Obviously, giving some of that 58, he's heart got a heart failure. It's potentially, they're not going to do well with that label at that age."
"Yeah. I mean, I think it's not particularly good for him to be having that label  inaudible 00:43:16 . He's never going to get his BMI down if he thinks he's got heart failure. So yeah. We have to think a little bit around the  inaudible 00:43:26  and ultimately, I don't think what I've told him is actually inaccurate or will impact on his, I think hopefully it will have more positive impact than saying you've got heart failure."
"Because he might look online and think, oh my God, I'm dying in five years."
"I mean, the Spironolactone for blood pressure because of the diuresis. And obviously it's got prognostic benefit. You could argue not so much in this ejection fraction group, but it's a very effective drug for blood pressure and as a diuretic. So, it's symptomatically very effective. Empagliflozin helps with his diabetes, and obviously he's got some prognostic benefit in this kind of patient group."
"I mean, from my point of view, there's not much outside I need to do with it. I mean, we've excluded kind of prognostic coronary disease. We've excluded kind of significant left ventricular impairment. He's on optimal heart failure medication as such. So from my point of view, there's not really much  inaudible 00:45:32  I can add to him. He needs to kind of have some monitoring in terms of probably education and, oh, one second, sorry."
"Okay.  Vanti 00:45:47 . Some education and kind of optimization of his therapy till he is stable. And then the community team will probably discharge him back into his GP for them to kind of manage his comorbidities as that's ultimately going to be the effect of treatment really, with some tweaking of his diuretic dose, depending on whether his edema progresses or is kind of, improves."
"Yeah. I mean, I think we would probably normally get them seen you once by the community heart failure team, just to make sure that they're ticking along okay. And then, in those patients who have got impaired LV function where there's room for their drugs to be optimized, and then they'll stay under the community heart failure team for obviously longer till their drugs are optimized and the patients are stable. This gentleman was already on max dose of Ramiprill and Bisoperolol for his hypertension. So there's little room to optimize his therapy. So, in patients like that, they'll probably go back to the primary care physician much quicker. And probably a higher percent of them will go back there sooner on later."
"Yeah, I think it's obviously variable on the patients. How engaged the patient is, what they're like with taking medication. If they're never been on any medication before, and then you suddenly give them five drugs. You think, okay, well, we'll probably best see them a few times in the community clinic because we don't know what their compliance is going to be like, and they're understanding all the medication, et cetera. So there's lots of, kind of factors there. And some of the patients who would feel that doesn't like it to be any, either engagement or kind of prognostic benefits in having them on the max therapies because they're very elderly or except then you might just think the GP can kind of keep an eye on these patients. Because there's not really much we're going to gain here by tweaking the Bisoperolol, or Frusemide, or the Ramiprill, is purely symptomatic treatment."
"Yeah. And the patients are stable, and then try and potentially give them back to the GP."
"No. Yeah. They can all prescribe, so they prescribe medication, optimize drugs and they can see the patients obviously much more regular than we can."
"Yeah. I mean, I'd assume they  inaudible 00:49:18  general lifestyle diet and they might do, I think there's an exercise program they on as well. So, I'm sure they do a variety of those things, but, I wouldn't know the ins and out, so."
"Yeah. I mean, it depends. I mean, as some of my colleagues might see them more regularly. I tend not to if I've dealt with all of the issues kind of first time, and I've got a plan, give a plan to the GP. And if there's obviously kind of a change from that, the patient's unwell, et cetera, then the GP can kind of get back to me. But I don't see them routinely for the sake of just seeing them when I've-"
"Established what I feel is the diagnosis, what the treatment is. And if the patient's stable, I don't see the need."
"Not necessarily. I suppose it depends on change of symptoms, really. I wouldn't do. I personally don't just arrange of routine echo."
"Yeah. If, there's a change. But I don't think there would be much to be gained by doing routine, because the treatment is not going to change in this guy. And some of the patients, his on kind of the  inaudible 00:51:17  of therapy, even if his ejection fraction dropped a little bit, it's not going to have immediate impact on his medication. If there's change of symptoms, then obviously it may be that there's something else that's happened. They developed coronary disease, et cetera. So, that may be a reason why he should be, maybe needs to be reinvestigated and then echo might be needed at that point to ensure, for just to update it. But, I don't do it routinely."
I  inaudible 00:51:47  patience for that really.
"I mean, the disease course can be very variable. Some of these patients will have one admission and that's it. And then they kind of manage their condition. They address their risk factors. The medication works for them and they kind of fine, and they don't trouble anybody. They deal with their condition and they don't have any other problems. Obviously, some patients will have multiple admissions with edema or progressive symptoms. Maybe because of poor compliance, maybe because they've got other comorbidities which keep being affected or, I think there's no general course. Some patients will be one stop and never seen again. Some patients will be seen every week because they keep coming in with something else, related to this kind of heart problem, or related to their comorbidities or because they developed something else."
"Again, I think it's very variable. There will be some patients who are coming in all the time because they either are very poorly compliant with medication or because the medication's very hard to kind of adjust because of their other comorbidities. If they've got renal failure or blood pressure issues, then there's a much tighter control or much less leeway for variation in the dose, which can make it more challenging. And if they may come in with renal failure, the medication gets stopped, then they get heart failure, then gets restarted and they're kind of up and down all the time. And some patients like in this chap, who's kind of on already well established medications, his got good renal function. I would anticipate that he shouldn't be coming back and forth because his toleration of the medication and the leeway that we've got with adjusting it is much greater. So, hopefully anything could be managed in the community rather than having him coming back. Because it's a challenge to manage it if he's, because he's not on renal failure and he's not 90, and he's not other multiple medical problems."
"But in the future with these comorbidities, he's much more likely to develop those problems and therefore, those things may become relevant five years down the line."
"Most of those patients, the ones that kind of the frequent attenders, are usually those that either may be seeing the heart failure nurses and they feel that they're filling up with fluid, they need to come in. Or they may just represent either  inaudible 00:55:08  their GP or they present themselves to the emergency department with issues of breathlessness or not feeling well. So that's why they tend to represent, rather than they don't tend to come to the clinic."
It tends to be more of an acute presentation rather than a kind of assessment in the clinic-
They don't make it to the clinic because they're usually presenting before that.
"Well, I think as we kind of discussed at the beginning really, identifying which patients we should label as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in a consistent way that everybody understands, would be very helpful because everyone's got their own kind of view it. And, then we know what playing field everyone's talking about and also how the medication that the trials in this group, what patients that's relevant for. So. I think that would be the first challenge is, which are these patients. Because I think there's a heterogeneous group in this population and that makes it hard. And, I think that's the biggest challenge, the major challenge really. What patients to be put in this box? I think we all happy that, well, the treatment options that we have are very limited, other than symptomatic treatment, or obviously the SGLT2s now can be used and potentially provide some benefit in the patients that they've enrolled in the study. And obviously whether they fit your criteria of heart failure with preserve ejection fraction or, it's obviously a personal choice."
"But I think most of us would probably say that there's a big gray area there and you can use it in wide variety of patients, which we're doing irrespective of whether they tick all the boxes of who's enrolled in parade, and preserved, sorry. So, identifying which patients we should label as having  inaudible 00:57:57 ."
"Airway disease, I specialize in airway disease. "
"No. No. No, no. That's since you're familiar with airway disease, I don't have anything else. "
Probably 100 patients I treat in a month's time. 
"I would say it's between five to 10 patient are mild, and- "
"All right. I was saying maybe five patient are mild. Most patients, maybe 50% of patients are ... about 50% patients it will be a moderate sleep apnea. Or moderate COPD, moderate to severe, about 50% of them. And then the rest, probably about 30%, 40% are severe sleep ... severe COPD. "
"I would use it as a second line to, as an additional therapy once they have failed LAMA-only therapy. Or if they have of asthma-COPD overlap, there are signs of asthma in addition to COPD, then I might use it as a first-line therapy. "
"But yeah, it's difficult ... I mean how many events? "
I have a different line. I'll call back. 
"Yeah, usually ... so when do I? Well, it's either one of two reasons. One I out of the bat have a patient with severe lung disease, severe lung function impairment or functional impairment, or a patient who doesn't respond to LAMA in case of patients with moderate to mild COPD by spirometry. So either you come in out of the bat with the really bad lung function, with FEV1 less than 50%, I probably would upfront start those patients with triple therapy, or you're somebody who has been trialed with monotherapy with LAMAs and then has not responded. "
"Or you're having exacerbations, with monotherapy. "
Two or more exacerbations or hospitalization. 
"Sure. The first step would be history of the patient, that it sound like cardiac or pulmonary from how they describe it. Oftentimes it's not clear upfront and additional testing is required. From my perspective, the first testing often is a complete lung function, a full point PFT with lung volumes and spirometry. We also have the availability of oscillometry in our lab, so that's one of the tests we would get. They will all get some sort of imaging, oftentimes starting off as an X-ray chest. Yeah, a chest X-ray at least, to get a sense of what we are dealing with. "
"A basic set of labs, and definitely a CBC. And if we suspect cardiovascular disease, that could include additional testing. That maybe EKG in clinic, right off of the bat when they come to see us in clinic, and echocardiogram if we really suspect cardiovascular disease. And maybe if we really think this is a cardiovascular problem, then referral to a cardiology clinic within our institution as well. "
"They have prior cardiovascular history or they have described this as something that maybe, may sound more like a angina where they have chest pain or pressure when they're exerting themselves. A typical symptom of cardiovascular, oftentimes it's not easy to distinguish between them. But if it's a straightforward, clear-cut case or cardiovascular disease, then we really don't pursue a lung workup more in those patients. Many a time, most patients will not be clear. They wouldn't be referred to us if people thought they had cardiovascular disease. So by bias of knowing that you won't get a patient who has necessarily cardiovascular disease, the majority of the cases tend to be either ambiguous or have lung disease. While saying that, we do here and there see patients who have, who need cardiovascular testing. Or many a times, they get sent to both clinics simultaneously. "
"Where we can easily tell this is somebody who has known cardiovascular disease or has symptoms typical of cardiovascular disease, including angina. Or some sort of abnormal rhythm problems where they have, let's say palpitations or some sort of arrhythmia. And then, that that patient gets really referred to a cardiovascular clinic right away. "
"We optimize COPD in that case. I mean irrespective of whether they have cardiovascular disease, their COPD needs to be optimized. So we would assess their symptoms and functional capacity, we would assess whether they have exacerbations and the lung function in that case. All three metrics and try and optimize them. Whether it's let's say, do they have ... what's their functional capacity? What grade of mMRC do they have? And what, how much exertion can they undertake? And to optimize that, are they having daytime symptoms or what kind of symptoms are they having? Is it just dyspnea, or is it cough? Then exacerbations, is it any mild exacerbations, do they need steroids and antibiotics periodically? Do they need to be in a hospital, have they ever needed to be in a hospital? Try and assess those questions. "
"So if they have both diseases, from my perspective, we would optimize COPD. We would try to give them whatever is goal-directed or whatever kind of care therapy for their COPD. "
"If cardiovascular clinic thinks that they are optimized from their end, then we would just take over from there. Let's say if the patient has coronary artery disease, they did a stress test already and there's no blockages, there's nothing that they can intervene upon and we've established that, then they would ... we would try and up the therapy for COPD at that point in time. "
"So, what percentage? I ... maybe at least 50% have some sort of comorbidity. "
"Which is the most common? I would say if they have cardiovascular disease, if there's additional cardiovascular disease. Because that tends to affect their functional capacity, it tends to affect how we do things. "
"No, actually I try to not become their primary care physician. So I don't own, take ownership of nonrespiratory conditions typically. "
"I could, I would direct them to the right person or get something started and move them along to that right step. But I wouldn't take ownership of nonrespiratory problems. "
What the cardiovascular disease ... how does it impact my treatment? 
"It doesn't impact my treatment at all. I mean, it just is a problem in parallel that needs to be addressed. There is concern, some concern that there are agonist bronchodilators and cardiovascular disease. But I don't think the data's great, and we ... I don't take that into consideration at all actually. "
"I would irrespective of their cardiovascular condition, optimize their COPD. And there's no therapy that I would hold off on. "
"Maybe even more, 50%, 60% have some sort of cardiovascular risk factor. Whether it's obesity, whether it's high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, majority would have some sort of condition that increases cardiovascular risk. "
"It's something I'm aware of, it's something that I make sure that something is being done. I don't necessarily, like I mentioned to take ownership of the problem. But I make sure that, let's say a person has uncontrolled hypertension that when the patient is aware of this problem too, there is some sort of therapy that the patient is on. And if there is need for adjustment of therapy, then I would communicate with the primary care physician and ensure that something is done about it. Or if I feel that it's cardiovascular disease that needs to be addressed, then I would make sure that I communicate with the cardiovascular doctors that would optimize the problem that is of concern. It's not something that I would bypass and not do anything about. At the same time even if I let's say initiate therapy for something, I wouldn't take ownership of that problem. "
"Ongoing problems, as in if a patient is seen in clinic where I do an EKG and there's EKG changes or they're having uncontrolled angina or unstable angina, it would be the priority. Because time is of essence in that situation, and I may even end up seeing ... sending the patient at the emergency room in that situation. So in that, in patients who are actually having a cardiovascular event or have unstable angina, and then cardiovascular disease in that case would take precedence. "
"The patient in that case, if it's unstable angina, would need either hospitalization ... in this case I would ensure the patient is taken to our emergency room. Or if it's something that could be managed as an outpatient, then it would end up being a phone call to the cardiovascular doctors who would manage their cardiovascular event at that point in time. "
"I think those patients are at higher risk of everything. In terms of symptoms and they have a dual cause of having symptoms, there's a risk of worsening of cardiovascular disease while we're thinking that their symptoms of are related to COPD. There is a possibility that cardiovascular disease is uncontrolled and needs to be optimized and could become an emergent situation if left ignored, or if one assumes that all their symptoms are from COPD. So, they need a little more attention and warrants of making that distinction of where the symptoms are coming from. Their functional capacity might be a little lower than a patient who does not have cardiovascular disease, and that could be because of underlying cardiovascular disease as well. So, they need a little more attention than a patient who doesn't have cardiovascular disease. "
"I would make sure that the cardiovascular disease is optimized, before I move to triple therapy. Let's say if a patient has mild to moderate obstruction on their lung function and the symptoms are out of proportion or they're having hospitalizations or visits where they feel more dyspneic, I would ensure that their cardiovascular disease is optimized. Once I am assured that that is the case ... and I wouldn't necessarily just, this wouldn't just be based on cardiovascular clinic is going to determine. I would make sure that they have determined and look at the data myself. For example, was there a stress test done or was there an echocardiogram that doesn't show congestive heart failure? Are they clinically in ... does it appear to me that their cardiovascular disease is optimized? "
"And once that has been established at that point in time, I could, I would consider triple therapy in that patient. "
"I would ensure that these things are done, I wouldn't just assume cardiology is going to take care of it. I would make sure they do it. But at the same time when I am making a determination of, ""This patient needs to move from monotherapy to triple therapy,"" I would in that case determine that the cardiovascular disease is optimized before I make that jump. "
"Yeah. I mean, they have more symptoms out of the bat. They tend to use healthcare more. And their functional capacity is limited, which is why, where they seek healthcare more than a person who doesn't have other comorbid illnesses, who don't have cardiovascular disease. And they tend to often present with greater symptom burden, thereby leading to greater need for healthcare. "
"I don't think they have more COPD exacerbations, I just feel they have more flareups. And there tends to be a reduced baseline capacity to do things and at the same time, more symptoms. And then oftentimes, they will have a event where it may or may not be upfront clear whether this is a COPD event or a cardiovascular event. Overall, between cardiovascular events and COPD events, there tends to be greater need for healthcare. "
"I mean, their risk factors should be addressed. So when I see a patient, I would ensure that they're on the right therapy for their comorbidnesses with ... whether it's high blood pressure, it's high cholesterol. I wouldn't go to the extent of ... let's say if they have uncontrolled high blood pressure. I would make sure that they're aware and something is done about it. But I wouldn't necessarily let's say, start managing actively their high blood pressure or where I'm starting them on cholesterol therapy. I'd ensure that there is ... these problems are addressed. And it's, they're taking their medications for example. I mean when medicants have ... reconciliation is done. We make sure that they're taking their medications and treating the comorbidnesses. It wouldn't be such that I all of a sudden become their primary care physician, who's checking their cholesterol levels or things like that. "
"And the similar situation, they get a patient who has dyspnea and they may or may not have cardiovascular disease. And if it's somebody in clinic, whether it's primary care or emergency room, thinks they have cardiovascular disease, refers the patient to them. They don't think it's cardiovascular or they have optimized cardiovascular disease, and then they would refer the patient to us. "
"To, say again? The cardiologist would not. No, they would not. "
And patients with COPD are at greater risk for having ... COPD is an independent risk factor of having cardiovascular disease. 
"And that's for various reasons, right? That's for, the reason that these patients will be less mobile. And they overall in a worst off health state, they can't do things that an average person does that prevents cardiovascular disease. They can't go and run five miles, they can't go and be active as a average person would do. Many a times they have out of their own choice, they have poor healthcare decision making. In the sense they could be some smokers and people who don't care about their smoking habit, many a times don't care about what they eat. So, there's many factors. Whether it's within their control or intentional from their aspect, or whether it's limitation because of COPD that increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, and they tend to have a greater likelihood. "
"I think it improves the likelihood that they would be more functional and let's say, do things that allow them to lose ... for example, they would be more likely to exercise if their COPD is optimized. So, their risk of things that would cause cardiovascular disease in them would be lesser. "
"If their cardiovascular disease is not optimized, then it will limit what they can do overall. And they wouldn't be able to either be compliant with therapy, their health isn't well. Or they wouldn't be able to let's say, go into rehab or go into ... doing things that we would hope they would do for optimizing their COPD. "
"And better functional capacity, which would mean better symptom, less symptoms and patient being more active. "
"No. No, no. No, no, no. No, I mean I think they kind of go hand in hand. You can't fix COPD without fixing the cardiovascular disease. And if one is addressed, the other gets some assistance or some improvement. "
"Well, where cardiac cause related death is significant in patients who have COPD across the largest trials in COPD. And it's one of the leading causes of death in patients with COPD. "
"I'm not surprised, I think this is data I'm familiar with. "
I'm not surprised again. I think that's a concern that I'm familiar with. 
"It's a significant number though. I mean, it's a large percentage of patients. "
"I am. And they may not be, depending on an everyday basis. That, but over a period of time if you have a patient you followed for a period of time. Most of the severe COPD patients, they would potentially have respiratory related death, but many of them actually have cardiovascular death as well. "
"It would either be the respiratory-related ... in our, in my practice one of three reasons. Would be the majority which are on this, actually graphic. And the respiratory-related deaths, the cancer-related, they have a cardiovascular disease-related death. Those are the main causes of death in our patients. "
"It outlays how patients with COPD alone versus cardiovascular disease alone. When they have a combination of both COPD and cardiovascular disease, their risk of ischemic heart disease is greater, their risk of heart failure is greater. "
"So either comparing to a situation where the patient just has COPD or just has cardiovascular disease, their risk of death is higher. "
"So, a combination of them leads to a greater chance of death. "
"I think there is a large variation in the reported data in the last ... COPD alone versus COPD with ischemic heart disease. The 40% to 140% they ... which variation, so I'm sure there's variant data reported from clinical trials. Irrespective of the number, whether you take 40% or 140% or whether you take 27% or 50%, number is high enough that this is, deserves attention. So, I wouldn't take too much out of a particular number. "
"When you look at the variation between 40% and 140%, it's just a factor of the data coming out of various clinical trials. One reporting 40%, the other reporting 140%, and there it again comes down to what study population they have included in the trial. "
"But either of those numbers, whichever way we look at this, that risk is high. "
"It's what, just really we talked about earlier. Yeah, I think it's something that we are aware of and we look out first. "
Does it make me think differently about COPD? It doesn't make me ... I mean it's something that I'm aware of already. 
"That patients with COPD have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, it's been known of a while now that this is the case. "
"Yeah. It's patients have COPD exacerbation, that their risk of heart attacks and stroke is greater after moderate exacerbation. So meaning they have taken steroids or antibiotics, would increase their risk of both heart disease ... in this case, or they should be 2.27 twice the risk of having a heart attack. And greater risk of stroke, not as much of an magnitude in difference. Or actually, hold on. This is time at the bottom. "
"But again, not as much a risk of stroke as it is of cardiovascular disease. So I ... basically it speaks off the vulnerability after these patients are going through an exacerbation. That at that point of time, it might be a dangerous period for them to have an exacerbation or have an event that could lead to cardiovascular disease ... or a cardiovascular event. Yeah, and that as well. "
"Their risk of stroke in ... is higher. I'm not sure. I mean, it might be some other comorbid illness in these patients. That is causing them to have, I would surmise that there is ... I don't think necessarily it would be directly from COPD, but COPD causing some that is increasing the risk of stroke. So whether it's, let's say atrial fibrillation for example. Which is common in patients who have COPD, and it would be something of that nature that leads to stroke. It wouldn't necessarily be COPD causing stroke. It would be something that COPD provokes or caused, and then the patient got stroke. "
"That moderate exacerbations are as concerning as a severe exacerbation. You don't want a patient to get to a severe exacerbation where they need emergency room visits or hospitalizations. But these are visits that these are of concern as well and should be addressed, of significant a magnitude as a patient who per se is only getting ... it's attention force. Yeah, that in other words, you don't just pay attention to severe exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations are also, deserve attention. "
"It reinforces my thought of the fact that exacerbations are concerning. That if a patient has them, need to be addressed and is a priority in managing these patients. And in fact is one of the major things we look for in patients who have or who, when we decide on therapy for these patients. In other words, the patient's symptoms might be mild or they might be not. If all you do on a day's time is surf channels on a television, you wouldn't come with, ""Hey, I can't walk a lot a lot."" Because you just don't walk a lot. "
"But if you're having exacerbations, that's not something that's subjective. It's something that can be objectively measured and is a parallel concern. In fact, that's what the guidelines have a few years ago gone towards as well. It's not just the symptoms of a patient. It's also their exacerbations which are important. It increases the risk of death, increases the risk of COPD-related death and of course related to other medical problems as we see here. "
"Well, there's a product that reduces all-cause mortality in patients who were given dual therapy. Whether it's LABA-LAMA or ICS-LABA, and even ICS ... so this is Product X on top of the ICS-LABA-LAMA, if I understand correctly. So, Product X added to triple therapy and versus no Product X? I assume it will be- "
"Got it. Got it. Got it, got it. Got it, got it. Got it, yeah. So triple therapy compared to a dual therapy in any fashion was found to reduce all-cause mortality, I would ... can't tell what the severity of the patient is and which patient population we're referring to. Or it does actually, moderate to severe. I see it's very severe COPD patients and led to a reduction in mortality, all-cause mortality. "
"Their odds ratio are 0.51, and it's significant. "
"So this product reduces this risk of mortality by 50%, compared to patients who are on dual therapy. "
"Yes, I understand. But it's Kaplan-Meier curves, I don't ... I can't tell the significance, showed a reduction in mortality compared to ICS-LABA as well. "
"Because the magnitude is probably, it may not be significant or it may be less than 49%. Where it appears to me in that, looking at the Kaplan-Meier curve. "
"Yeah, and it's probably the steroid component that's causing the reduction. And the additive benefit of using LABA-LAMA and a steroid is apparent from the data, from this data point. "
"I think what would be interesting is open-label versus ... I don't think there would be, so I'm not sure there's going to be any difference open-label versus ICS-LABA-LAMA. In other words if I use a combination inhaler, let's say a LAMA plus a second inhaler that has ICS-LABA, I don't think there is any such ... I'm not familiar with any data where somebody compared open-label versus a triple inhaler combination. "
"It's probably exacerbations. There is reduction in exacerbation, patients who get inhaled steroids. So, that probably could be a factor here. There's obviously over period of time going to be less symptoms in patients who have, who got an triple inhaler therapy. That could be another reason why they are more functional and able to better maintain their health and have less a risk of mortality from diseases. "
"That's a good number actually. I mean we do other things like lung cancer screening with the patients with COPD, the number needed is 320 in those patients. So, it's a promising number. It's a small number of people need to be treated to achieve a benefit, so it's not a bad number to look at. "
I'm usually aware of these data already. 
"But if I was to let's say, looking at this de novo and this is the first time I was looking at it, I would be excited about how combination therapy triple inhalers is superior in terms of reducing mortality in patients who have gotten dual therapy with LABA-LAMA. "
"So compared to LABA-LAMA, there's a reduction in cardiovascular events and which is MACE outcomes. "
"There's a reduction in nonfatal MI, and there's a reduction in cardiovascular death. And the slide basically surmises that a lot of the mortality difference between Product X and LABA-LAMA could be related to cardiovascular disease and a lower cardiovascular disease in these patients, or deaths in these patients based on those datas. "
"I would be curious to look at the baseline cardiovascular disease between the two groups, people who have gotten Product X and LABA-LAMA and randomize to these arms. And before I take anything away from this table, I would ensure that their baseline cardiovascular disease was equal. "
"And then after the trial period, if it appears to us that let's say, a year on therapy their cardiovascular disease is lower with patients with ICS-LABA-LAMA, it's probably a factor of exacerbations. We looked at the prior data that exacerbations. Which you showed me, I think was second or third slide, that there is reduction and there's increase in cardiovascular events even after moderate exacerbation. So it kind of speaks to that data, that cardiovascular disease is lower. "
"I do feel it's surprising. The only surprising part, the big surprising part for me is that there is not reduction in respiratory deaths. There's reduction in cardiovascular death, which is interesting actually. Because I mean, you would hope that there would be a reduction in both actually. Not just cardiovascular death, that would be reduction in respiratory death as well. But it doesn't look like it, how I've seen. "
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Seven, five, that much small numbers. "
"Compelling in terms of jumping from a single inhaler to ... so let's just, we'll talk about a patient. If we were to start a patient on a single inhaler, it'll likely be LAMA, because LAMA is superior than LABA. And then when we decide for various reasons to go to a second or a third inhaler, there is some impetus and some suggestion that jumping to a triple inhaler in this case. Unless you think a patient has asthma, you wouldn't give them ICS-LABA, in that case. There's not many formulations for LAMA-ICS, and then leaving you a choice of either LABA-LAMA or a triple inhaler. And comparing a patient who will be started on either of these two arms, there's a reduction in exacerbation for sure. Which I don't think we've talked about in triple inhaler versus LABA-LAMA. There's a reduction in improvement and functional capacity, for sure, we already know that. Then there is some reduction in mortality, which might be additive benefit in these patients. That could be viable, it showed reduction in exacerbations. So, it does make it more favorable to start the patient on triple inhaler. "
"Not just for their respiratory health and not just for improving their exacerbations and symptoms from COPD, but also some additive benefit from reduction in cardiovascular events and related death. "
"The trend is very similar. In cardiovascular events, whether it's MACE outcomes or there's nonfatal MI or death. And there is no disco discrepancy, so it's less likely that we're looking at this by chance. If there was discrepancy in, let's say deaths were lower and other outcomes were worse in Product X or a triple inhaler, then that could make it possible that we are finding what we have by chance. But then there is, the trend is very similar across the various spectrum, the spectrum of cardiovascular events. Of course we don't see that effect in stroke, which again goes very similar to the data we saw earlier where the impact wasn't as much in stroke patients, of stroke in these patients. "
"Correct. Because you're not only seeing mortality difference, you're also seeing nonfatal MI difference. You're also seeing MACE, which is major adverse cardiovascular events after even treating patients who have coronary artery disease. Yeah, so you're seeing ... usually or less likely it is by chance that we find where we are. "
"Without ... it shows me that there's a significant reduction in ... it kind of hints that there might be a reduction in cardiovascular deaths. Which is why the death is much lower in patients ... well, and compared to LABA-LAMA. It doesn't show me that there is no difference in ... however, there is a small percentage of patients who actually had respiratory event. It doesn't hide that data, and it's probably going to invoke some inquiry from whoever is looking at this. To try and explore whether the death was, whether there was a difference in respiratory death or it's just majority of the reduction in cardiovascular death is causing the reduction in overall mortality. "
"I find it compelling. I find it compelling that ... just looking at the data, I would say there is reduction in ... there is a higher preponderance of patients to get on triple inhaler compared to LABA-LAMA. "
"It's hard to get people on LABA-LAMA out of the bat anyways, it's not as easy. The therapy options aren't as easily available, at least to my clinic and my set of patients with what insurance they have. It's much easier- "
"I am restricted. I have ... yeah. Most insurance companies, many insurance companies are ... there's, it's hard to get separate LABA-LAMA. And it's even, it has traditionally been hard to get let's say ... or ELLIPTA, which is a combination, it harder for me to get those approved. Most formularies have LABA ... or I'm sorry, LAMA. Then ICS-LABA, and then a triple inhaler option. "
"I think it's interesting, and might be a good selling point to the patient where there's some impetus in staying on their therapy. I mean in addition that it's not only going to help your respiratory health, improve your symptoms, potentially even have some pulmonary lung function, reduce your exacerbation, but also it would reduce the chance of you dying. Not just from COPD, from cardiovascular events which are high in these patients. "
"It would clarify the previous risk of cardiovascular deaths and cardiovascular disease that increased in COPD, that's well established. And you showed it in the first slide, there is large clinical trials of thousands of patients that have shown that risk. And so, it kind of has the data that exists and helps us understand better how treatment of COPD mitigates that risk that is preestablished. "
"Product Y. What's Product Y? That's ... oh, it's different, a different product? "
"The takeaway from this slide is probably the number needed to treat. If you're giving patients standard of care medications, whether it's statin or SGLT-2 inhibitors or ACE inhibitors, there's a reduction which reduce cardiovascular mortality. And the number needed to treat, for those patients is much higher than 80 or 121 in giving them triple inhaler. I don't think other ones are comparing COPD patients, we're just looking at a subset of patients in Trial X and Trial Y where a patient has COPD. "
"But it kind of puts things into perspective, that it's a much easier thing to give a patient and achieves some benefit. Now comparing X and Y, I think it could be just a matter of chance that one triple inhaler has a number needed to treat of 80 and the other one has 121. You will look at things that which study population, which country? How were they at baseline, what disease did the patients X and Y have at baseline? Because those factors can impact the number needed to treat and for, why are we seeing a difference? "
"In other words, it's not just the medicine. It could just be a factor of other factors that's causing additional- "
"It may, if both are available. But in the US, and it's often the case that one is on-formulary for one patient and another is on-formulary for another patient. But if there is a option where both are available, then it could lopside some patients to get X versus Y. "
"A average physician may look at that and say, ""Hey, you know what? I can give this patient ICS-LABA and there is some additional benefit, potentially, and why not?"" "
"Or one who gets the other also, right? I mean, the number treat is much smaller in patients who got X. "
"This is similar, where we talked about it. "
"It adds to ... well, like I said earlier. We knew from that slide itself the number needed to treat is 80. "
"And it puts that number into perspective, compared to other therapies in cardiovascular disease. "
"We know from the prior slide that there a reduction in mortality with Product X in patients who have COPD, and that could be a factor of reduction in cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. If the number needed to treat from that data is 80, and this puts that number into perspective compared to other standard of care medications which are very well established for reducing mortality in cardiovascular disease. So, it just puts that in data into better perspective. "
"It doesn't change the impression of that data, per se, it doesn't go against or for that data. Because the data essentially just ... this slide puts into perspective, what we learned in that slide. "
It's much easier to give them LABA-LAMA and ICS combination and reduce their mortality- 
"Yeah, a triple therapy and reduce their mortality by doing that. And the benefit is as strong as giving them statin or ACE inhibitor, or other therapies that are very well known and established to reduce mortality in these patients. So it's a very easy thing to do for a pulmonologist, at the same time with a lot of benefit that may not be apparent if one doesn't think about it. "
"Triple inhaler versus LABA-LAMA reduces cardiovascular mortality and events, and thereby can impact patients' mortality significantly compared to LABA-LAMA. So there is some impetus, yes, it does improve some understanding of that. A patient may benefit better with triple therapy compared to LABA-LAMA, and that could be by a reduction in cardiovascular events. "
"Correct. Correct. I mean, it is well established already that there is increased risk of cardiovascular events and disease. And in clarifying how we can impact that known risk, is triple inhalers are superior to LABA-LAMA in reducing cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Thereby impacting overall mortality of a patient, and might be better than LABA-LAMA to reduce these events and subsequent mortality from these events. "
I feel less bad in not aggressively pursuing LABA-LAMA. 
"So out of my practice, I already feel that LABA-LAMA, one does one and the same thing better than the other. It's LAMA, it is better at what LABA is doing. And we are overall trying to use a different mechanism by attacking the disease with steroids, right? Combining steroids through this whole thing. So by looking at this data, it kind of reinforces my belief that using a different mechanism and not just adding therapy on the same lines of bronchodilator therapy is probably helpful to these patients. It reinforces my practice, actually, and makes me feel less worried about, ""Hey, I can't get a patient on LABA-LAMA."" "
"And essentially what was happening in that case, LABA-LAMA uses muscarinic versus beta-2 agonist action to bronchodilate these patients and thereby improves lung function and reduces symptoms, reduces exacerbations. "
"So instead of trying to do more of the same, we're doing a different mechanism by adding steroids. And by doing that, we are also achieving other things like reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality by reducing exacerbation perhaps. So, I'm already doing some of this. But it might be, it puts into a perspective who ... and makes me feel reassured. "
"No. No, this is helpful, I'm probably going to do some more research on this myself and go from there. "
"So I'm a general medicine respiratory and intensive care physician. I'm triple accredited, and I work in a cardiothoracic  inaudible 00:00:26  referral center, which also offers transplants and advanced heart failure and lung failure strategies. So if you like, I mean all three of my  inaudible 00:00:40  are equal, but I do 50% intensive care cardiothoracic ICU and 50% respiratory managerially, I'm head of lung division."
"COPD, probably about a hundred, maybe sometimes more, but usually about a hundred."
"So age is probably above 60, often above 70 as well. But it, and they can raise to 90. I mean, we've had 92 or 96, and we've had the odd centenarian as well. But on the whole, it's 65 and above. Yes, we do have people who are younger, incidentally. I mean there's 55 year olds, et cetera, with COPD as well. Because we have a transplant center, and they're usually under the age of 60 when we've transplanted them. So there's definitely in the 50 groups as well, 50 age range as well."
"The severity, they tend to be, for me, I mean I've got a bit of a spread, but the bias is towards the more severe group. And it's, if you look at the GOLD stage classification, then you are looking at two, three and four, rather than one. Because I work in the cardiac center, I have a lot of patients who are coming in for cardiac surgery or cardiology procedures who may be at a lower stage. So I optimize them as well, but across the board, if I'm just looking at my respiratory practice alone, then it would be mainly two, three and four GOLD stage, which is the sort of mild, moderate, and severe. But across the board, I see a lot of the mild ones as well, because they come in for other procedures and they get optimized by me."
"Yeah. I mean, so I offer what's called a head to toe, skin to skin optimization. So I call it total body optimization. So I, somebody comes to me and says, look, I'm breathless. I say, right, let's find out what's going on. So you take a history, perform examination, and then go to the right investigations if you like."
"And I try and structurally evaluate what  inaudible 00:03:08  are. So in the case of COPD, yes, the lungs, HRCT lung function, blood tests to look for anemia, renal, liver, bone profiles, BNP. They get an echo, some will get a cardiac MRI, but mainly an echo. And then I'll optimize them depending on what I find."
"So if it's, they're often either an exacerbated phenotype or a breathlessness phenotype. If it's the breathlessness phenotype, then once I've, been through the investigations with them, whatever's amiss, if you like, we try and tighten it up. If that's airways disease, then yes, they escalate treatment. If that's heart disease, then I sort that out. If that's skeletal muscle, if that's reflux, if that's bone density issues, if that's cancer, if that's atrial fibrillation, et cetera. So there's about 11 comorbidities I go through, and we just make sure we've tightened everything else."
On triple therapy? Is that before they come to me or after?
"Of all the people who come to me, probably about 80% are on triple therapy after they've left me."
"So people who are exacerbating, people who are breathless on dual therapy, people with severe disease, people with, I mean, it depends on what stage they come to me. But if they, I'll you an example, if people come to me and they're on monotherapy and they're, and I do lung function and I take a history and the history says they have two or three exacerbations a year, and the lung function shows that it's GOLD stage three, they'll get triple therapy."
"And sometimes the impetus is more because they've got an operation, which could be aortic valve and grafts. So they're undergoing bypass surgery. And so I need to get this right quicker, if you see what I'm saying."
"So I'm probably aiming for triple much more often than dual in my practice now, because people are coming needing to be fully optimized rather than in a stepwise. So if I was going from mono to dual, I'm only expecting a small benefit. If I go to triple, I'm expecting a larger benefit. And if I, I'm basically, I'm looking to optimize their physiology as worth their symptomatology."
"So exacerbations, I mean, before it used to be two exacerbations or more. Now it's any exacerbator."
"So, excuse me. We make a fine pair today. So exacerbators in the sense that they can be a community exacerbators or hospital admission exacerbators. The hospital ones get treated as a more severe group because they've got less reserve, if you like, or they've had a harder deal of it. But the exacerbation, if you like. So I treat them in the sense that once you get an exacerbator, that's a red flag almost, to try and intervene."
"Short of breath, no diagnosis, is that chronic or acute? They're sick now, or they've been sick for several months or years."
"So they're well, no, what I'm trying to say is they're just sick over the last few hours or few days, or they've been sick for many months?"
"Okay. So if they've been unwell for the last few hours, they'll normally come to A&E department rather than come to me. But what you want to do is find out that they haven't had a pulmonary embolism, that they've not had a pneumothorax, that they've not got heart failure, and they're not bleeding. Those are probably the most important things in why they're acutely breathless. Is this an acute exacerbation of COPD, but before it is you need to make sure you've excluded some important things that also treating."
"Of course you can have an acute exacerbation COPD with those as well. So it's about comorbidities as well as, so you could have more than one thing going on at the same time. So those guys will get a CTPA, they'll get an echo, they'll get enzymes for their heart. They'll, and I get an idea of whether there's like clots, if they've had a pneumothorax, if they've had, if they've got  inaudible 00:09:10 , they'll get some blood test, CRP, whites,  inaudible 00:09:12 , procalcitonin. They'll get a blood count, look for anemia, and then I'll treat."
"Yeah. So the chronic dyspnea is a huge part of the practice, especially with long COVID as well, it's become a massive part of practice. But it always has been a problem. It's just that I think people are coming round to it the last 10 years, we've been doing total body optimization. But I think, the main barrier actually for doing total product optimization is commissioning, not patients unmet clinical need, is the commissioners don't understand this as a pathway."
"But the way it's different is that you've got a bit more time to stratify things. So for instance, I can have lung function, which is really helpful. Spiral reversibility, gas transfer. When you're gasping, you can't do good lung function. But when you are chronically ill, then, and it's been there for a while, you can give me a feel for how well you're doing."
"Yeah, they'll get a CT scan. If I'm thinking pulmonary embolism, it's unlikely, but if I'm thinking then they'll get a CTPA pulmonary angiogram. If not, they'll just get a high resolution CT, which will show me bronchiectasis. But also very importantly, it will allow me to characterize what their COPD is, how  inaudible 00:10:43  it is, et cetera."
"The other beautiful part about the CT is that it gives me outside lungs data, and that is hiatus hernia. So if you've got reflux, that is the pulmonary artery, what's the size of it. That is bone density, so I can see fractures, vertebra fractures. And I can also see coronary calcification to give me an idea of it's going to be heart disease."
"So it's good for both in the lung and outside the lung. It gives me data on the diaphragm, in the lung, it gives me data on fibrosis, and it gives me data on bronchiectasis, as well as, so there's inside the lung four things, outside the lung four things. And that's how a scan can help you. Lung function tells me about the severity, spirometry, but also gas transfer, and also tells about reversibility, is there an asthmatic component to this?"
"And then the echo is helpful, is there a heart failure component, a lot of patients with my COPD have ischemic heart disease. They get a 12 lead ECG to make sure they haven't got atrial fibrillation. On clinical examination that also gets looked for. And then there's a blood test. The blood tests are full  inaudible 00:11:55  renal, bone, liver, BNP, B12, folate, iron, vitamin D."
"And if they're on a statin, they get a CK. Acutely, they'll get D-Dimers. Chronic, probably not so important."
"So if there is, it's a heart failure, two types. One is either left ventricular failure or right ventricular failure. If it's right ventricular failure, then you need to image the heart better. Echo, isn't the best modality for right ventricle. But if you can get good views, especially in  inaudible 00:12:45  patients, they can't get good echo views at all, it's very difficult."
"Then you treat accordingly. So if it's right heart failure, then it's often, what's the cause of that, right heart failure? Is it ischemic? Is it valvular? Is it due to the pulmonary artery because of pulmonary hypertension? And is the pulmonary hypertension due to clots or due to the COPD? Okay."
"So if it's, some things are commissioned and some things aren't in terms of treatment. But they'll get furosemide, so offloading if you like. And if they need a pulmonary artery dilator, then that's a hard thing to sanction. But if it is possible, then we'll push for that in our center. Left ventricular failure, bit more straightforward. Furosemide to offload the lungs, ACE inhibitor, B2 blocker, spironolactone or equivalent  inaudible 00:13:40 , and statins, aspirin, and the cardiologist, very importantly."
"If it's due to atrial fibrillation, then there's always three things, rhythm rate and stroke prevention. And whether it's a big block or digoxin you want to use, for rate, for rhythm, you can use amiodarone. But very importantly, you get it shocked and back into sinus, or you get the electrophysiologist to ablate. And then for stroke prevention, it's anticoagulation."
"The vast, I would, to be honest with you, I haven't come across a COPD patient who hasn't got one. And it's because you're looking for, the more I'm looking for it, the more I find."
"The commonest is probably, gosh, it's a good question, actually. I'm trying to think, to be honest with you, because there's a few of them. So the commonest is probably ischemic heart disease, I suspect. I'm trying to think of that versus anemia. Because I see a lot of iron deficiency anemia, but I see ischemic heart disease as well. And I see, yeah, I get it, I think ischemic heart disease probably is the commonest."
"So non-respiratory, the most concerning is probably the degree of heart failure. So ischemic heart disease, yes. But if it's causing heart failure, then yes even more. Hypertensive heart failure, okay, is common anyway. Atrial fibrillation on top of that causes me more concern. The one thing about COPD is if you have AF and COPD and you're admitted to hospital, your mortality is high. So in the chronic phase, it's a good idea to try and fix that, if you'd like."
"Lung cancer is the other thing that concerns us. But you know, that's not, I don't know if you'd put that into respiratory or non respiratory. But it's, and then I think heart failure probably, and stroke, I guess. I think those two probably would worry me the most."
"Well, in the sense that, I think more important is that."
"Sorry, it's, I give it equal billing if you like. I mean, the impact is that the patients will get the  inaudible 00:17:40  for the COPD, but they'll also get the heart failure treatment and the interventions that they require for their heart disease, which I think, and the end, the impact is that it improves their long term outcome. Because most of my COPD patients, that's not just me, but international data will say patients, vast majority have comorbidities and they die of the comorbidities, rather than the COPD. So the impact is great."
"I mean, you could argue that it could go there quicker. But I think I'm there anyway in that respect. So you can make the case that people with heart disease perhaps should have triple therapy quicker. And that's wholly true, but to be honest with you, most of mine are on that anyway."
"Very. I mean pharmacologically, to the investigations and pharmacology I'm involved with, basically it's all me. But the intervention, if there's a cardiac cath required, or a stent required, or ablation required, then that's, my cardiology colleagues do that."
"I mean, the quick answer is I don't have to do it that way. The advantage I have is that I have them closer to hand. So I have eight colleagues, I can tell you  inaudible 00:19:47  that's not how the patients are managed. So being in the center is one thing, but what I find very helpful is, I mean, my approach is different, I know that. But what I'm really lucky about is that I have investigations, and I have diagnostics and people that I can tap into and get stuff done."
"No, I'm very comfortable doing it, but the approach is slightly different because the patients, if you like, are having more done to them. But that puts them into a higher severity category."
"So I, my comfort zone's fine, but it's the, the way you treat the patient is different. Because obviously they're having, they're coming for something and they're having a lot done them."
"Yeah, yeah. For stent, I mean the echocardiographic department does the echo for me. The cardiac MRI people do the cardiac MRI for me. But if you mean referring to a consultant colleague, yes, of course. I mean, if they need their ischemic heart disease assessing and treating, they go to a cardiologist to get looked at it. They need ablation, then they get ablation, they get assessed for that. If they need, as you said, cardiac surgery, then that's a cardiac surgical referral."
Or they need to be assessed for intervention. That's when I refer them.
"We co-manage them. I mean, it varies a little bit, to be honest with you. Depending on what cardiologists you using, some of them will want to take a bit more of an interest, others will say, I've done my bit back to you. Because everybody's got massive workloads. So quick answer is that we co-manage the patients, but you know, you utilize the skill that you require for that particular part of the journey."
Yeah. It's a large part of my referral base. So...
"No, I was going to say, so they may have patients who are coming in for procedure, who have smoked for a long time, are breathless. And on a regular basis, every day almost, I'll get a referral saying, could you optimize this person to see that he's fit enough for the procedure? Or it might be, we've treated this guy, he's only got a little bit better from his cardiology. Maybe you could look at the rest of him and see what happens."
"The other way around there isn't. But then the cardio doesn't do much other medicine, so that's okay. I mean, that's just part of the job."
"If it comes to me, I'll look after him. Because if there's something for me to do, and I look after him, and they'll look after heart bit and I look after lung bit."
"The relationship is very  inaudible 00:24:43 . But not  inaudible 00:24:47  epidemiological data, but we don't have treatment, we don't have data on once you've intervened, and what are the benefits. I mean, some of the more recent studies have tried to look at ischemic disease and cardiac deaths and this sort of stuff, but that's relatively recent. But otherwise it's something that's just been a long time coming."
"Well, influence in the sense that if you have an exacerbation, you're at a higher risk of having an MI and a stroke. So that's bad news for cardiovascular outcomes, and there's an appreciable mortality with that."
"So that's in the acute setting. And if I look at it from a pathophysiological point of view, pathophysiological, look, if you've got low oxygen levels in the body, all right, then the heart is going to suffer because it doesn't get oxygen to the heart, and the heart needs to pump it to the rest the body and so on. So it's a very, I see it as a very tight relationship. It's not  inaudible 00:26:29  very effectively. And I appreciate that's not easy. But I think the relationship between COPD and cardiovascular comorbidities, I think is strong, but it'll differ in different populations, it'll differ in  inaudible 00:26:47 , it'll differ in people who are more"
"Yeah, very much so.  inaudible 00:27:24  The question is though, is it a complete cause or is it a contributory? And more often it's contributory, but that shouldn't mean that we neglect it. Because fixing someone's lungs who's got emphysema is hard. You can give  inaudible 00:27:40  you're not going to get the lungs back. But actually improving their breathlessness through the inhaler and the iron infusion, and offloading the heart, makes a bigger difference, if you see what I'm saying. So the lungs may not be a hundred percent, but breathlessness might be a lot better."
"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you like, if I just fixed the lungs, die of a heart attack, then it feels slightly academic. So yeah, absolutely. No,  inaudible 00:28:38 "
"The direct effect on each disease process. But if you've got ischemic heart disease or you've got  inaudible 00:29:29  you've got heart failure for whatever reason, then its ability to drive blood around the body and deliver oxygen is impaired. And that will be the same for lungs."
"So another way around, if the airways aren't doing the job that they're supposed to be doing, having to work harder to get the right amount of oxygen into the blood which can be pumped around the body. The heart's having to work much harder  inaudible 00:30:04  because if you look, the oxygen level is lower than it should be, but the body still needs what it needs,  inaudible 00:30:12 . And so somebody has to compensate. Where that's increased red cells or increase the heart rate, or what it is that you need to do as a compensation mechanism, it will happen."
"So I have no doubt that it happens all the time, but I couldn't tell you that the process of an inflammation in the airways is going to directly affect the inflammation of the heart. That's a little bit more tenuous. I think it's necessary either, I think it's easy."
Yeah. I think it's completely straightforward from normal physiology.
"If people are struggling to perform, if  inaudible 00:31:01  is under strain, then the lungs aren't, are going to have to compensate. And if the lungs are strained, the hearts going to have to to compensate. If the two are both strained, then you haven't got far to go."
"I mean, the punchline in the punchline. Across the four studies, up to 39% of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular causes. So EUROSCOP basically has the highest number there. So somewhere between 22 and 39% of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular disease. It's not a surprise.  inaudible 00:32:23 "
"We see it all the time, is a quick answer. So experientially, we see this a lot."
"Both connection. And because it's an elderly population at the end of the day, so they both coexist and they both co-conspire, if you like, to early mortality."
"Absolutely. The same people will have this. Interesting, you have a large cancer death as well in that group. I haven't realized it was that high, in that LHS III group. Wow, I need to look at that one again. 54 is a lot higher than I had put it at. That looks like a strange one. But I'd figured it was around the sort of 30, 35% mark, which is what you have for the others. But cardiovascular is definitely on a par with cancer related deaths, for sure."
"I mean, TORCH has a high number, so does UPLIFT. The other thing  inaudible 00:33:54  here is that how was cardiovascular death defined? And if they're all different in the different studies, then it's difficult to make comparisons."
"So we may have under called it, is what I'm saying. But no, it doesn't surprise me. I mean, LHS III, I don't know what that study was. I know the other three a little bit. But oh, this is the low the, what does LHS stand for, do you know?"
"Don't worry. Okay. I mean, you've definitely got TORCH and UPLIFT giving you high percentages. So it depends on the group of patients you're treating. If you've got a slightly biased group, and also what you're looking for, if you are looking for certain things, you are more likely to find them."
"No, no. It just provides more ammunition to my thoughts."
Individuals who have two time risk of cardiovascular disease. Ischemic heart disease. Yep. Okay. Yep. Got that.
"Yeah, it's good data. I mean, I haven't seen the references, but none of that is surprising."
"There's always going to be a variability  inaudible 00:35:53 . So if you go to an area which has a high smoking incidence, poor socioeconomic conditions, difficulty accessing medical facilities, et cetera. You are always going to find the higher end of that spectrum."
"I see it all the time, but you sometimes think that the people, you just, the people you see, maybe the others aren't seeing the same thing. So yeah, my practice, that is not, that is not a surprise."
"I mean, smoking is the common ethological factor. There's also age. I think the third that's important is people aren't being looked at. So if you have COPD, you may not be being looked at for ischemic heart disease, and vice versa. So there might be a delay in that happening for you. You know, it's like anything else, if I find thing and I want to fix it and I do and he feels better. That doesn't mean that there's an absence of something else there. So unless I proactively look for it, I probably won't see it. And then when it does manifest, it'll be  inaudible 00:37:43 ."
"So I think ethologically, they share the same triggers if you like, or risk factors. Age and heart, and smoking being two very important ones. Also, I mean, a lot of patients with COPD are diabetic. But there is this whole idea of inflammation. There's a common thinking that there is, the inflammatory nature of COPD can also be an accelerator for atherosclerosis, and therefore ischemic heart disease. So that is a scientific discussion. In reality, it's in front of my eyes. We see them all the time."
"Yep. MI risk doubles within a week. Yeah, that's true. 40% increase of stroke within 10 days. Yeah. That's also true. Yep. Fine."
"Not me per se, but I think it would help change the way that it's perceived as a whole."
"I mean, it, I think it would act as a good stimulator for respiratory physicians to think a bit further up a field and cardiac, cardiologist to think about what the risks are in those COPD patients."
"I don't the answer to that one,  inaudible 00:40:16  but what I do know is that you can make a strong case for it. And I think  inaudible 00:40:21  and shows them the data, and many of my colleagues are scientifically driven, evidence based clinicians. So this sort of data will be really helpful for them."
"Mobile, it's just the messages coming through."
"That one.   00:40:51  Sorry. Yeah, let's see if I can just turn that down a little bit. So it's not off completely."
I think it's a really good way of showing the reduction in mortality versus the LABA/LAMA. In terms of dual. I think it's a good way of pictorially demonstrating what benefits are. Yeah.
"It just, you're reinforcing my bias basically. And I think this just makes me feel that what I'm doing is right, if you like. So yeah, it's good put that way. I like the idea of all that."
"Well, there's a 49% reduction or improvement in survival, whichever you look at it. In mortality. If you're in triple versus dual and, I mean, it's giving an NNT of 80, so you got to treat 80 people to save one life."
"You can also see that the two diverge very early, I think that's fair to say. And they stay separate at 52 weeks. There's also ICS/LABA in there, which seems to be closer to the triple than it does to the dual. So I think, for me, it would be the percentage reduction, but also the NNT. So you can understand, people are able to see, people can understand that this is all cause mortality, not just organ specific related mortality."
"So triple therapy, cardiovascular has, so all cause is lower in that triple arm anyway, but cardiovascular is lower than the LABA/LAVA, but the same as ICS/LAVA. Respiratory, roughly the same. Associated pneumonia is roughly the same. Cancer is, the ICS/LAVA seems to have a few more. And the other is roughly the same, the  inaudible 00:44:38  less than the triple. So it looks like the CV mortality is lower in the triple versus the dual at LABA/LAVA, not necessarily ICS/LAVA."
"I don't know, is the quick answer. I mean, it's something you need large studies like this to tease out. What I do know is that people on triple feel better, they can walk further, they exacerbate less. So for me, you're on a winner. It's certainly no worse than ICS/LAVA. Okay. So that's, so if it has the cardiovascular equivalence, but everything else is better, then I think it's a no brainer, personally."
"Yeah. It's just an additional piece of information, just to show that as well as all cause mortality, you're specifically going for cardiovascular. But it's helpful. It's always going to be helpful."
"The quick answer is, it might be a game changer if you're going to cardiologists. I think it's a nice to have otherwise, I don't think it hurts in any way at all to have that, by the way. I think it's a very useful thing to have. Also, it makes the story more plausible. Because one of the questions somebody might ask is, so why is that all cause mortality, where does the benefit come from? And it would be good to say at least part of it is going from cardiovascular disease."
"You mean like having triple therapy and seeing if it makes it, has an impact on   00:47:05 "
"Yeah. I think it's a very good thing. It's a very, very powerful tool."
"Okay. Yeah. I see it.  inaudible 00:47:52  therapy is 0.8, 1.2. Well, they're at least comparable if not better than the landmark cardiovascular studies. And I think, I've said this for years by the way, but it's really important of highlight this sort of stuff."
"Because, so just say, goes back to training. Cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular intervention, the importance of detecting patients with cardiovascular symptoms, risk stratifying them, treating them early and intervening is, has been ingrained into our training. Okay. Everybody. General practice, psychiatrist, doesn't matter who you are. But you know, heart disease governs okay."
"But when you put it in context, then people begin to realize that actually there are other conditions too, that also impact upon people's survival and outcome. And actually the size of the effect is just as good, if not better. And the  inaudible 00:49:22  big one for that. So I think it's really helpful, having these comparisons. Because it takes what we've been used to, what we've grown up with, what we've relied on, what are our standard plinths, if you like, those we work on every day."
"This just puts it all in perspective. And therefore allows people to think about why this product is that good. Because we make a massive song and dance about ACE inhibitors, about SGLT  inaudible 00:49:57  I am the same, I do the same statin. Aspirin is not on there, but it would be good as well. And yet, triple therapy or dual therapy or  inaudible 00:50:09  therapy, doesn't have the same billing. And so it is really useful."
"The different populations, different products, who was able to use different devices. There are lots of factors in there that could be influencing the outcome. Bottom line is you have two very clear outcomes. If you look at the left hand graph, you have two statin ones. One is NNT 164, one is 257. So I wouldn't be too surprised if the inhalers were different as well, if you see what I'm saying. Just statins are just swallowed orally. It's a piece of cake. You've got the added complexity of device and technique and adherence, et cetera in here. So."
"Yeah, exactly. It's very difficult unless we go into the detail."
"Yeah, no, sure. I mean, I don't think anything shocked me. I think some of what I did find was useful is having some of the numbers to hand. I think it's presented to you in this way, you can start quoting it. And that's very helpful, because it means that you can start to affect change in your own, people around you. So I think that's really important."
"I think having combined presentations and meetings is very helpful. In my hospital, it would be the cardiologist, it'd be the cardiac surgeons, it would be the anesthetists, and it would be us, the respiratory physicians. I think that, and I work in both camps. So I straddle both intensive care and risk  inaudible 00:53:27  medicine. But what I'm trying to say is, it's very helpful to have this debate. They're not, the thing is, respiratory physicians had grown up with inhalers."
"None of the others have. So it's very hard for them to just think the small inhaler is going to fix, reduce. It's difficult for them to understand that. They're very much into big things. We put a stent in, we do a graft. We ablate, it's very much, how shall I put it, a mechanical, massive change earthquake, you know?"
"So for them to understand that this inhaler that you take is going to reduce the  inaudible 00:54:09 , it will be a bit of a jump for them. Not saying we don't do that. And I know for my own practice, they send me patients and I mean, even 10 years on, they're always pleasantly surprised when somebody does really well. So they keep sending patients because they think, I mean, they're very lovely about it. They just write things like please do your magic. Well, I mean, and it's lovely of them to say that, but actually they can do it as well. It's just the confidence, if you see what I'm saying. It's just the confidence."
"Very much so. And that could occur at primary care level, that could occur at cardiologist. That could occur on a lot of people's levels, if you like. So I don't think, I think you might get earlier changes if you like, because people have recognized it and feel confident about doing this. It's like anything else, all of them have got habits. It'll be okay, but it's about habits and confidence. And that's, it's just process, isn't it."
"No. Apart from, I hope you get well soon, and in the next  inaudible 00:55:46  you have a nice, pleasant day."
"Hello, and thank you. I have the respondent on the line. Diane, you may proceed."
"Yeah, so I'm a chest physician. I work in a hospital in the North of England. I have some areas of specialist interest. I won't tell you what they are because you might be able to identify where I work because of them."
"But I have got sort of a quite broad, general respiratory practice as well. I see loads of patients with COPD, asthma, and a bit of everything else."
"Probably 20% mild, and then probably about 40% each moderate and severe."
"Where does it fit in my algorithm, or where does it fit in the algorithm, maybe slight different."
"You have to remember that my, sort of slightly, the population is biased because we tend to see the more severe end of the spectrum in secondary care, so a lot of people are already on triple therapy, and in COPD, all roads end in triple therapy anyway. We have limited steps to take in a step wise approach, so we've basically got two steps, the second of which is, or maybe three, the third of which is triple therapy. I think there is evidence to suggest it's a reasonable thing to do in most patients. Most patients tolerate it pretty well, and there's a relatively limited evidence of harm, so as I say, I think all roads end in triple therapy, and that's supported by general practice and guidelines I think."
"Well, usually, so either you've been started directly on a triple therapy in the first place, which probably isn't the right thing to do as things are at the moment. I mean, historically, we had loads and loads of people that would commence on things like Seretide back in the day, and then when LAMA became available, they were added. Spiriva was added in. They were, because there wasn't really anywhere else to go above, as it was Seretide and Symbicort, so then that third option, when it became available, particularly in patients with breathlessness got added in. Obviously there's different moves that we can make now in terms of what combinations do we try first in the milder breathless patients that probably go on a LABA/LAMA fixed dose combination. But then they either start exacerbating, or they get worse, and the guidelines say, well, move to triple therapy. We really haven't gotten anywhere else to go. Most patients step up either from LABA/LAMA, they step up to triple therapy, or they're already on triple therapy as they have been historically, and then they get put on the fixed. "
"Yeah, so any patient who's short of breath, you take a history from. Very often you can get clues as to what's going on from the history-"
"... particularly ... Such as how long it's been going on for, any other associated features, do they have a smoking history, do they have a previous respiratory history, and usually it's pretty clear from the history what the underlying diagnosis is likely to be. We do some tests as well, and the two tests that we do  inaudible 00:06:40  patient in the first visit would be chest X-ray, which might give you the answer, and the spirometry which might give you the answer. Yeah, so at that point, you would usually have a fairer idea of what's going on and what further investigations might be needed. "
"Yeah, so we do get some patients who have, who end up having a cardiac diagnosis, but again, from your history and your examination findings, you should be able to pick a degree of those up, so there will be certain queues in the history to suggest he might be cardiovascular, so do they get ... Do they got chest pain? Do they get lightheaded or dizzy, any sort of associated ankle swelling, other symptoms of cardiac failure? You might do an ECG, which might show evidence of cardiac ischemia. You might listen to the patient's heart sounds, which might show some murmurs. If there's a consideration that there might be an underlying cardiovascular cause, then what I would do, is I would request probably a CT coronaries, if I thought that they might have ischemic heart disease, and an echocardiogram if I thought that they might have some kind of valve problem or heart failure."
"It would be a combination of symptoms in the first line investigation findings. If you have symptoms that were suggestive of cardiovascular cause, then that would, might divert the investigations in a particular direction, or if you know, for example, their spirometry was normal, their X-ray was normal, you might then start thinking of other potential causes. "
"It depends. I mean, I wouldn't say that every patient has all the tests done in parallel. Maybe about 30% of the time, patients who are referred with breathlessness, you don't find an underlying primary respiratory cause, so you then might look at, look for cardiovascular causes in those patients. Maybe under the 30 to 40% you will find an underlying cardiovascular cause. "
"I'll investigate for the cardiovascular causes, or the cardiological causes, and if there is one, I will then refer them to a cardiologist for management of that if there is an underlying cardiac issue. "
"Assuming that there's no underlying respiratory issues, yes, I mean, there are patients who have dual comorbidities, and so in that situation, you might expect that ... You might co-manage them, so I might manage the respiratory component. They may manage the cardiac component. But if there's no underlying respiratory component, and it's all cardiovascular, then yeah, they get moved onto a cardiologist. "
"I would assess whether they need some kind of inhaled therapy, so assuming that they're breathless for that, a clear exacerbation history, I'd probably put them on a LABA/LAMA fixed dose combination. I would talk to them about smoking cessation. I would talk to them about ... Well, I would refer them for consideration of pulmonary rehabilitation. "
"Probably ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes."
"Well, they're all concerning. I mean, it's, we might be going ... Where we might be going with this is which of those impacts most on the COPD, as do   00:11:41 -"
"Because it's sometimes hard to know what ... In somebody with comorbidities, what proportion of their symptoms is due to their respiratory problems, what proportion is due to the cardiovascular, and you often find that you never achieve complete control of anything really. All you do is you manage each of the comorbidities to the best of your ability."
"In terms of the sort of day-to-day, management is limited really. Unfortunately, as the years have gone by, I think specialists have become more specialized, and our overview of certain general medical carriers is less than perhaps it was 15 years ago, so I think it's very much about I look after my bit, and if there's other bits that aren't well-controlled, I can send it to somebody who knows what they're doing. But, perhaps I'm not best placed to make those individual management changes or decisions."
"No, no, because I don't consider myself to be up-to-date enough to know what the current guidance for third line anti-hypertensive medicine or third line oral anti-anginal medicine is, so I would always seek specialists in both of that."
"Pretty much all of them really, because obviously 95% of the patients with COPD are all have at some point been smokers, so that's usually the one cardiovascular risk factor. Often they have all the risk factors as well. Again, the population that I serve is ... There's a high incidence population of, a high incidence within the population of cardiovascular disease, low socioeconomic status, and socioeconomic depravation. All of these things are relative risk factors, and also, sort of lifestyles that go with those things are all inherently with increased cardiovascular risks as well."
"Consider them in the sense that if ... If I've got a patient with COPD, I ... Some of the issues that are covered in, for example, pulmonary rehabilitation program, some of those issues will be ... Some of those risk factors will be covered as part of that package of intervention. However, I don't think ... I don't consider it to be part of my role to assess, and monitor, and manage secondary prevention for example, because logistically, we just don't have the capacity to do that."
"... because again, a lot of these comorbidities are managed in primary care as well. "
"Other than trying to work ... Well, yeah, so other than trying to work out what, whether and what proportion of their symptoms might be due to their cardiovascular comorbidity rather than a respiratory diagnosis, that's about it. I don't consciously think, oh, they've got cardiovascular disease, so therefore I must use combination X rather than treatment Y. "
That's not something that I particularly consider. 
"I mean, I suppose some people might argue that if they're on beta blockers, for example, does that render any who are under bronchodilator therapy slightly less effective? I mean the beta blockers that they tend to be on are all highly cardiovascular selective, and also, are a lot of ... The diagnosis, if you like, of, or the definition of COPD is that it's fixed airways disease which isn't responsive to bronchodilatation, so yes, patients get bronchiospasm and wheeze when they're inflamed and exacerbating. But it's unusual for patients with COPD and fixed airflow absorption to broncho constrict if they get beta blockers."
I wouldn't consider it to be greater or less. You may tell me differently with this data to suggest that it is. But I wouldn't consider ... I wouldn't treat a patient differently because they've got a cardiovascular comorbidity versus if they haven't.
"I mean, again, I don't really have any other than clearly, there may be a crossover of symptomatology, so if you've got symptoms attributable to both COPD and to cardiovascular disease, then it can be sometimes slightly more challenging to work out which is which. But, in terms of are you more likely to have cardiovascular disease if you've got COPD, or vice-versa, obviously, we've got the common underlying risk factors, and we've got some sort of common potential lifestyle links and socioeconomic links. But apart from that, I don't know that the diagnosis of COPD confers a higher cardiovascular risk or vice-versa, other than the fact that you've got all those very clear common risk factors. "
"I don't know that I believe that a patient's cardiovascular disease, per se, contributes to a worsening of their COPD. It might be that if we continue to do stuff that makes the cardiovascular disease worse, or the COPD worse, like smoking, it might contribute over to one or the other of those things."
"But I don't know that there's a clear, okay, your cardiovascular disease is getting worse. Therefore, it's going to make your COPD worse. That's the case."
"Same. Exactly the same answer. I'm not ... I mean, it may be that I'm not aware of it, but and it does exist, but it's not something that I clearly think about. "
"I don't know. Because, so I'm looking at ... The first thing that I'm seeing is that this is reported deaths in COPD in clinical trials. That makes me think first of all that the numbers are probably quite small, which again, if you look at a population of five and a half thousand COPD patients, those numbers have definitely ... It's what you would kind of expect. I guess, it's how those deaths are reported. I mean, the other thing to say is that there's quite a ... There's not really a consistency within those to a degree  inaudible 00:22:28 , in that yes there are some deaths reported or classified as respiratory-related, so why in some studies of those, is it three times greater in one study, and then another study it's about the same, and then in another study it's less?"
I think that makes the data quite difficult to interpret really.
"Yeah you see, that's not ... That's a slightly misleading statement-"
"... because I think what that says, so you might read that as saying, across four studies, 39% of deaths were due to cardiovascular causes. That's not what it says. In one of the studies, that's quoted, that had a cause of death of 39%. But actually, one of the others was less than half of that."
"Actually, that's a slightly misleading statement, and what would be a much better statement would be across the four studies, what the absolute percentage is."
"I mean, in terms of the absolute number there, I perhaps wouldn't have been able to quote the numbers, but it's not great surprise for the reasons that we've talked about. If you've got COPD, you're likely to ... You've had risk factors for cardiovascular disease, so therefore that double risk isn't-"
"Then, yeah, so if you've got two things, you're more likely to die of them than if you've just got one thing. Again, outside of the absolute numbers, that's not a great surprise there. "
"Yeah, it's slightly difficult to get your head around that really, in terms of trying to sort out what ... Because for me, ischemic heart disease plus COPD is the same as ischemic heart disease plus COPD. But is it then implying that it's easier to manage a cardiovascular condition than a secondary prevention on its own than it is if you throw COPD in there? I don't know, and what it doesn't take into account, and what there isn't any sort of indication there is, is of severity of either of those things either, is there? Again, it's just the sort of headline statements, which are quite difficult to compare like with like because I don't fully understand how they've classified the groups if that makes sense."
"Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't disagree with that. As we said before, the risk factors are common, and so you wouldn't be surprised if somebody with COPD also had cardiovascular disease. But, what I can't get my head around is why is having ischemic heart disease with COPD worse than having COPD with ischemic heart disease, because to me it's the same thing."
"Yeah, except some of the people that I see have got COPD and cardiovascular disease, so it's about managing them rather than one or other elements if that makes sense."
"Okay, so maybe this is slightly more interesting, so  inaudible 00:28:26  MI during ... Well, during or after a COPD exacerbation is significantly raised. Yeah, I mean, that's perhaps ... That inflammation is ... In terms of the numbers, is perhaps higher than I might have expected. Again, not sure I can fully explain it. Is it because of steroids? Is it because of increased cardiovascular risk, increased  inaudible 00:28:53 , I don't know. But it's perhaps more than I would have expected."
"Again, the same. It's interesting, isn't it, that the risk of stroke seems to increase over the one to 10 day period and risk of MI tends to drop a little bit, so again, I'm not entirely sure I can explain that. Is it because people with high exacerbations can get arrhythmias or can get  inaudible 00:29:24  or something like that? I don't know. Just trying to think of ways to explain it. But it is, it's certainly interesting."
"I think it's difficult to define what a moderate exacerbation is sometimes. An exacerbation is an exacerbation, and you know, one man's mild is another man's moderate is another man's severe."
"These are classifications within clinical trials. I mean, the other thing that we can't see here is what the absolute numbers are. If in the trial population, there was one MI in the control group, and one MI in the non-exacerbating group, and two MI's in the exacerbation group of I don't however many hundreds of thousands of patients, then that's not quite as powerful as if the numbers were much bigger, so it'd be interesting to see what the absolute numbers were."
"I mean, I suppose you could extrapolate and say, well, obviously preventing exacerbations therefore, if during exacerbations, you're at a higher risk of these happening, don't have an exacerbation, and you're at a lower risk of them happening. Do stuff to prevent your exacerbations. "
"Well, you would give treatments which you would be aimed to reduce the exacerbation frequency."
"We would optimize them in, optimize during inhaled therapies, they're not already on triple. But of course, they're already on triple so you can't do that. You might do other things like smoking cessation, like pulmonary rehabilitation. You might use things like current macrolide antibiotic therapy if you though that, that was potentially something that would benefit the patient. "
I think that they would be highly likely to already be on triple therapy because all roads end in triple therapy. 
"Product X reduces mortality. Then, as often is the case in these slides, there's lots of words which I'm just trying to read, and then there's lots of numbers that compare numbers to numbers. It's quite difficult to interpret what that compared to that means. Then you look at the absolute numbers, and the numbers are statistically significant but nevertheless quite small so you're looking at two and a half percent, one and a half percent probably something like that, which yes is a 49% reduction, but the numbers are small, so how you compare, how you apply that to an individual is quite difficult to know, and we're looking at, it's quite a big trial, isn't it, eight and a half thousand patients to show a 1% reduction in mortality. What I don't know is what the absolute numbers of mortalities were. Yeah, numbers needed to treat, does that mean you need to treat 80 people to save, to stop one mortality?"
"Well, it would be if you're lucky, you're very wide confidence interval as well. Relatively wide confidence interval big numbers in the trials, small numbers of mortalities. I think it's a difficult one really-"
"Yeah, because the patient who you're treating at the time doesn't care about the rest of the population. Above that patient assessing for me and my clinic, what I want to do is to optimize the treatment to reduce the impact of the disease on them, and their lifestyle, their functional capacity, to a degree, their comorbidities. But, and then you hope that, that will have a morbidity and a mortality benefit down the line. But, you don't think in terms of I'm treating this patient because it will show a population benefit when actually the population benefit is relatively modest anyway. I think that it's difficult to justify treating a patient differently. It's medicine  inaudible 00:35:05 , isn't it? Okay, X plus Y equals that. Medicine  inaudible 00:35:10  doesn't necessarily help that patient who might have a specific phenotype or a specific set of symptoms that sit and improve."
"No, I don't think so. I mean, I think you can always say, ""Well, what is it about product X which has got bits of both of the other things in, which makes the mortality benefit better than those people that have just got the two ingredients in it?"" Why is it that a triple end combination is better than the two  inaudible 00:36:01  combination and again, I kind of can't explain that, and is that ... I can't explain it."
"Well, not really. I mean, all roads end in triple, so the good news is that the reason that we followed all roads end in triple probably is the right thing to do, isn't it? If you believe this mortality data, then that sort of, I guess it kind of reassures the school of thought that actually inhaled steroids maybe should be the last thing that you add in because it is the ... The risk associated with inhaled steroids, the stuff around pneumonia signals with inhaled steroids, and things, so perhaps this data is reassuring around that, and actually, sort of almost flies in the face of that information about inhaled steroids being bad for you. If you look at this curve, it would suggest that actually, not being on the triple is bad for you. "
"Yeah, again, it's difficult isn't it, because the population here is the moderate to very severe patients. That's the population that in whom the mortality benefit is there, and that's the patients in whom triple therapy is indicated based on the studies and based on the labels. I don't think that this, on this data here, there's anything to justify telling people to use triple therapy early, because you can't extrapolate the data that isn't there. This is only the data for the patients whom which use the data."
"I mean, if you look at the numbers, there does seem to be a benefit, particularly when you're comparing to the non-ICS group, doesn't there, in terms of cardiovascular benefits, which is strange because steroids are supposed to increase cardiovascular risks, aren't they, rather than lower it. That's what we're always taught when we've got people on maintenance, oral steroids for example. There does seem to be that sort of clear ... Between the triple and the LABA/LAMA, there definitely seems to be a benefit in the addition of the ICS. Yeah, that's quite interesting."
"Yeah, so I mean, again, that's the sort of the reassurance around the previously stated ICS causes and pneumonia. There doesn't seem to be anything within this dataset which backs that up at all."
"I mean, there does seem to be a benefit from triple versus LABA/LAMA apart from non-fatal  inaudible 00:41:05 , but the numbers are very, very small. There does seem to be a benefit in the triple, including ICS rather than LABA/LAMA."
"I think, I mean, there does appear to be some interesting data that maybe suggests that the incidence of cardiovascular complications is higher in patients on LABA/LAMA than on triple, and there also appears to be some reassurance that the pneumonia rate in patients who are on triple is not excessive, and in fact is the same as just being on LABA/LAMA. "
"You could understand why that, why some people may consider that to be logical. But again, I guess you have to just think about the populations that you treat, and if this is ... I think this is the same population, which is moderate to very severe, who inherently will already have established cardiovascular risk factors, et cetera, et cetera. I think you have to be quite careful about who and how you compare treatment groups with ... Because there might be another data set in mild to moderate patients that shows that actually there's no difference, and then you don't want to expose patients towards a potential steroid side effect, which will be there, whatever they're on, so I think   00:43:07 -"
"Yeah, so what we don't know, because we don't know what we don't ... Well, we know what we don't know, and what we don't know is what the effect is in this milder patient population group. What we've got in the milder group is we've got loads of data about LABA/LAMA versus LAMA or LABA on their own, and we've got ... We might have some data that's LABA/LAMA versus ICS LABA. But, in the milder populations, we don't have those, that data around triple because there's never really been any ... I don't think there's been any sort of big studies done in those groups that show those benefits. "
"I don't think it changes it too much. I think, I mean, I think it is reassuring. It's interesting. I think that certainly a line in there about no accessing the pneumonia deaths or pneumonia mortality would be helpful as well, because again, that's been the thing that in the past, has always been they don't give them ICS because it causes excessive pneumonia, and I think that's quite reassuring, so it's almost ... You could almost have that sort of double whammy if you like of less cardiovascular, significantly less cardiovascular deaths, no excess pneumonia deaths, which I think almost sort of double strengthens the data."
"Yeah, so does it cause cardiovascular risk reduction, or is there something else going on? Is the cardiovascular risk reduction because there's a benefit in COPD, or is the cardiovascular risk reduction because there's a benefit in other aspects of the cardiovascular disease, maybe reduced arrhythmias, maybe I don't know, prevention of tachycardias, maybe improved myocardial oxygenation. I don't know. I'm just literally making stuff up as I'm going."
It's kind of difficult to know what the mechanism is-
"... and I think maybe trying to overthink it might be a little bit difficult, and I think that maybe just taking the data at relatively face value, it is certainly interesting data. I think it's more about a reassurance that triple therapy's good to use rather than a compelling reason to use it earlier I think."
"I think if we had some clearer information about the mechanism of how it, how triple therapy benefits, then that might be quite interesting. But, the data in the mild patient group is what we need to support the use of it in the milder patient group. "
"I don't know because that data isn't there. I think if the goal of this is to say get more people on triple, well, everybody's already on triple anyway, so that kind of isn't necessarily a goal. If it's to get people on triple earlier, then what we need is the data to support its use in milder patients rather than saying, ""Look, it's really good in severe patients, so use it earlier."" "
"We're going inhalers,  inaudible 00:48:09 , and statins? "
"No, that's my cynical, slightly facetious statement. I think it's difficult, isn't it, and I think that yeah, it's interesting ... It's interesting data. It's interesting to say that okay, you're just at risk ratio in  inaudible 00:48:37  is this, and then you've sort of thrown me slightly because you've then given this another product, which presumably is different molecules. Is there something within the specific molecules which confers that mortality benefit rather than a class effect, don't know."
"I don't know what the molecules were. But then, I think it's quite difficult to compare cardiovascular studies to mortality in inhaler triple therapy studies, because the populations are completely different. I guess what this is trying to say subliminally is well, you've got no problem given the staffing based on these population numbers, so why don't you give the triple therapy based on these population numbers, and that might be a valid argument, but I think there's always going to be that confounded in the completely different populations. I think different endpoints being studied. "
"Not particularly, because I don't think it's ever really specifically being looked at, and maybe this is making those think a little bit differently about the patients that we're treating. Maybe we should be thinking more wholistically, or where we started off by saying yeah, I just sent it back to the GP for the secondary prevention stuff to be done, so maybe we should be thinking a little bit more wholistically around it. But then, the patients are already on triple anyway. If triple's protective, and the numbers are like this compared to the cardiovascular studies, then we're actually doing the right thing already. I'm not sure what else there is to be gained by knowing this data, other than those being reassured that we're doing the right thing, because we're already doing it. "
"It might do. It might mean that achieving the, it's available in the right device, or the patient could use, and the physiology is okay, and the frequency of dosing is okay, and there's no adverse events, there's been no adverse reactions to components previously or anything on those lines, then yeah, it might influence your choice. But again, if you're trying to treat a population, or if you're trying to treat an individual, I think it's very different ... I think it's very difficult to say that you're ... Right, if you take product X versus product Y, you're 40% less likely to die. I don't think you can say that at all. I think it's just about being reassured that you're doing the right thing by giving triple rather than looking for very marginal benefits for an individual in using that specific triple."
"Now, a sort of health economics perspective, or a public health perspective, then you might be thinking, okay, well, in which case, let's get rid of all combinations and just give everybody product X."
"Because that then might have, if you get a million patients with COPD, that might ... If you believe the data, that might actually confer a significant survival benefit. The survival benefit might create its own problems. But, in terms of the hard and the fast numbers on doing the right thing and giving the right treatment, then yes, it's reassuring that that triple is the right thing to do."
"I think it confirms that there is a link. It confirms that giving patients triple therapy is the right thing to do, and that there may be a benefit outside of purely preventing COPD exacerbations. There may be a mechanism or a benefit that confers improvement in a cardiovascular risk, or it might be a consequence helped reducing their exacerbation frequency for example. I think it's reassured as again, that the idea that inhaled steroids are bad because everyone dies of pneumonia, as being probably something that we should put to bed."
"Yeah, so I don't know is the answer, and again, is it that there's something specific to the individual components? Is there something that's specific to one of the molecules which hasn't improved cardiovascular risk compared to the other? I don't know. I'm just thinking aloud really."
"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, trials in the milder patients might be interesting. It might be interesting to see whether there's any sort of mortality signals in patients who are maybe on duals with the same constituent molecules. If X is, for example ... I don't know, if X is Trelegy, and Y is Trimbow, it might be interesting to see is there any mortality benefit in  inaudible 00:56:00  versus  inaudible 00:56:01 . For example, is there, are there any signals within those studies that might help you understand the molecule side of things. "
"I think that the significant potential mortality benefit that you can see with the data that you showed me, but also that reassurance that the addition of inhaled steroids isn't necessarily associated with an adverse outcome, which I think there's a lot of-"
"I think it's a bit of both. I think there's a perception that the addition of inhaled steroids doesn't necessarily confer a significant benefit, and also that sort of risk benefit outside of the risk of pneumonia."
"Hello, and thank you. We now have the respondent. Diane, go ahead please."
"Yeah, so basically I'm a GP. I've been GP for 21 years. I have a special interest in actually in COPD, diabetes. I'm also prescribing lead for the practice as well, and also the cancer lead as well."
"I mean, you're talking about telephone and via face to face or overall?"
"I would say in percentages, mild would be approximately 40% moderate would be probably about 50% and then about 10% severe/very severe."
"More likely the fixed combination at the moment, actually just because they're easier to administer. I'd say approximately, I would say about 30% of my patients probably on it."
"I think it's basically, obviously we've tried the steroid-based inhalers and also the long-acting inhalers as well. We're not getting anywhere, and sometimes it's patient compliance as well. So that's basically where we add in the triple therapy, usually it's one inhaler."
"I think it, as I said, number one it's compliance. And obviously the main thing is really exacerbations isn't it? The patient's having lots of exacerbations despite the treatment you're giving. So obviously, you are looking for something to try and rationalize their treatment, whether they actually have less exacerbations be that infections or wheezing or hospitalizations."
"No, I was going to say obviously, we do review them and obviously if they're using a lot of inhalers as well, but generally those to stop those symptoms. That's why we use those things."
"Oh, it's a difficult question to answer really. I think that varies for patients, but I would say if they're having more than one every few months. That's difficult to answer because we basically monitor each patient. If we notice that they're having lots of steroids and antibiotics, I would say probably more than one every three months maybe. We might consider it at that stage."
"I mean, obviously at the moment we're not doing spirometry, so that's a big issue. So, it's normally we would do spirometry for patiently with COPD, asthma, just to see how they are being treated. But normally we start with bronchodilators short-acting sometimes-"
"Oh, so you want me to go through that? Okay."
"So, that's going to be very broad then. So obviously a patient has to be short of breath. I like had a patient today. So obviously the first thing I'd do is take a history, obviously. Find out when they're getting short of breath. Try and work out is it respiratory? Is it cardiac? So there'll be questions like any chest pain, breathlessness on exertion, any  inaudible 00:07:36  when they lie flat, any ankle swelling, any cough, productive cough, anything like that. So, that's where I'd start. So obviously a good history is very important, trying to work out what's going on. Are there smoker?"
"And then second stage would be obviously examining them. So I took this oxygen saturation, blood pressure. Listen to their chest. Check their ankles. And then obviously we move on to other investigations such as ECG, chest X-ray. And then obviously maybe spirometry if we could do it, but we can't at the moment and blood tests, especially check if they're anemic or there's any raised brain natriuretic peptide suggesting they've got cardiac issues. So those kinds of things basically would be to help me towards a diagnosis of where we were going with this."
"No, I actually do them together. Actually I did that today, actually with a patient. So a patient, she'd had previous lung problems. She'd had breast cancer in the past. That's the thing about general practice. You've got to think about a multifaceted approach because it is better to do everything and then look back, but it's not always easy to ascertain what the causes are. And I think it's unfair to the patient if you have multiple visits. So you do cardiac and then they come back and you consider respiratory. So generally I will try and do everything in one sitting because I don't think it's fair on the patient. We should do everything together, really."
"Yes, I would do. Because you can't assume that's the cause. As I said, a chest X-ray is an easy thing to do and obviously you want to see them back with all the investigations back so you can decide what the next steps are. So, as I said, if I'd had spirometry, I would've done that for the patient as well, but unfortunately I didn't have it. So it's not always clear sometimes where you're going. Is it heart failure? Is it COPD? Is it asthma? You can't always tell just by history sometimes for a patient, which way you're going. And I think, especially when they're more elderly, when sometimes COPD might start, it's not always easy to ascertain where you are with with the patient. And I think obviously the history can sometimes be very, very clear that this is cardiovascular or this is respiratory. But if there's a doubt, I think I would investigate them for both at the same time."
"Okay, when you talk about cardiovascular disease, that's another point  inaudible 00:11:09 , so is this heart failure? So if it's heart failure, they got raised BNP blood test, then I would consider doing an echocardiogram. So, obviously I've done an ECG before that as well. So I can actually refer directly for the echo because you can't refer them for an echo without an ECG. And the chest X-ray is actually quite important as well. As I said, if I investigate for respiratory, I can use that chest X-ray for the echo as well. So that if you think it's something like angina or cardiac ischemia, then obviously you would obviously try and start them on blood thinners, maybe refer them to cardiologists, maybe to rapid access chest clinic, because they're getting breathless. So that's probably where I'd go more than likely."
"So I'm very lucky that I've got a COPD nurse. So we would probably bring the patient back and sit down with them and discuss their symptoms in a bit more depth. And obviously look at the inhalers. We've got lots of dummy inhalers we could show them, so they can go through that with the patient and see what would suit them. So obviously if they're really struggling with the symptoms, we could consider steroid and antibiotics straight away if they've got chest infections, something like that. But generally I would show them the different inhalers and bring them back to see my nurse, just to have a chat with them, to go through. Because she can obviously spend a bit more time with them going through what symptoms they've got and in terms of starting treatment as well as going through how to use it and everything. So I don't really have time to go through all of that and go through all these different inhalers and things like that. So that's quite helpful, and she's very experienced."
"I would say quite a high majority. I'd probably say about 60 to 70% just because obviously COPD is more in older patients, isn't it? So they've probably got other comorbidities at that point anyway. So you probably say quite a high proportion probably have got other comorbidities at the same time."
"I think you probably mentioned it, cardiovascular. Because it's a sort of double whammy for the patient in terms of they've got cardiac issues and they've got lung issues. So that puts a lot of strain on their body. And I think that's the one that I do worry about."
"Obviously if they've got cardiac issues, they might already be under a cardiologist or we're prescribing for them for blood pressure or something like that. I mean, if it's a simple blood pressure, we won't probably be dealing with that, because anything like angina or anything, then obviously the cardiologist might be involved. And obviously the other comorbidity possibly that I would be worried about is diabetes just because obviously that also would make them more prone to have problems and get infections more easily."
"Yes. I mean, as I said I mentioned I'm a diabetic lead. So, it's yeah, we would deal with that as well. And I have a diabetic nurse as well. I'm quite lucky I have a diabetic, NP nurse. So, my diabetic nurse and COPD nurse, they're very nice. And obviously we get on like a house on fire. So, we work between us and, but if there's diabetes, I can deal with that in practice. I can start someone oral medications or insulin as well if they need it. So, I can treat them all in one sitting really  inaudible 00:15:43 -"
"So say for instance, I do an echocardiogram. Basically at the end of the echocardiogram, the consultant will make a recommendation or medications to start. That's one aspect. The other aspect obviously if it's cardiovascular disease like angina, the patient would normally be referred to the rapid access chest clinic or something like that. So they would come back with a treatment plan as well. So that would be medications that we should prescribe to manage them going forward. So we do have that kind of thing, but you do get recommendations from the clinics that they attend and obviously then we manage them from there and we don't always need to refer them back. It's normally they get discharged after one appointment. So normally we can manage it after that once we know what we're dealing with, but it's sometimes getting to the full diagnosis of how bad things are. Then we can treat it from there."
"So I think I mentioned high blood pressure and things that I'm completely comfortable with, not a problem at all. That's bread and butter stuff. I think if it's anything more than that, like they've got severe heart failure or they've got angina any ischemic heart disease going on in the background, then that would be something I would refer for just because obviously a cardiologist might consider some other option such as angiograms or PTIs, things like that. So I would refer them just for an opinion the first time. Or I don't know if you've heard about this Advice and Guidance."
"So basically, say for instance, I have a patient who has got ischemic heart disease and I'm a bit worried about their medication. I actually send a letter or a message to a cardiologist to give me advice on what to do next. So I don't actually even need to send the patient to see them and they can send back a recommendation, do this, this, this, and this. And if this doesn't help, then please refer him to us. So, sometimes I can deal with it by that as well. And is there's something else called Consultant Connect. I don't know if you've heard of that as well?"
"Okay. So, Consultant Connect is basically like an app and I can actually upload information for the patient. It's like WhatsApp for consultants send to cardiology. I said, it's like a cardiologist and they can send me back recommendations. So there's two ways I can access a consultant without actually having to send the patient to see the consultant."
"I mean, obviously a lot of these patients would be overweight. So I'd probably say about 40% maybe because lot would be overweight. They might smoke. They might be not very, what's the word I'm looking for, not lazy.   00:19:33  They don't exercise. So I know the word I'm thinking of, but it's not coming to mind, but yeah. So, they might not exercise. So these will be risk factors. They might have high cholesterol. So those kinds of things are also in the background. Obviously, if they've got diabetes as well, that's even worse or high blood pressure. So these things can all be in the background despite their COPD."
"I mean, generally, most patients when they get to 50, they'll have a 50 plus health check. We are doing 40 plus health checks as well in our practice. So we would be doing screening things like blood pressures, checking HB, A1Cs, talking about smoking, things like that. So they do have that kind of opportunity, but obviously if they don't come and see you obviously you did talk about this hidden iceberg of patients that we never see. I mean, that does exist. So obviously if they don't come and see you and they present with COPD, you're not going to jump around looking at cardiovascular risk factors too much. You'd probably be more interested in COPD. But obviously if they're already under you, you probably would've done their blood pressure, checked their  inaudible 00:21:00  and done other tests then anyway."
"I think it depends on how bad it is and which one's worse. I think obviously if they're really  inaudible 00:21:37  COPD patient, then probably the cardiovascular disease would probably take second place. But again, if the cardiovascular disease is worse and COPD is quite mild then. So I think it does depend on the presentation of the patient. So I think that's a difficult question to answer because it does depend on which way round it is. Because obviously we have COPD patients who are really bad COPD patients and probably you wouldn't look too much at their cardiovascular disease unless you do annual blood tests or something like that. So, it does depend on which side of the seesaw is worse basically."
"I don't think it does really impact too much. You've got to be careful of things that beta blockers, because obviously that might make their COPD worse. And also some non-steriodals that can supposedly sometimes cause COPD to get worse. So in terms of drug choices a little bit, it might affect what you give them. So probably more in that respect rather than anything else."
"No, I wouldn't say so. No, I wouldn't say that affects that. One of the things I think about no, not at all."
"I think they'd have more cardiovascular exacerbations just because their breathing isn't great. So they'd be struggling. And obviously sometimes if you're struggling to breathe, you can put pressure on your heart and that can actually cause more cardiovascular problems. So, probably I'd say more exacerbation."
"Sometimes, but not often. I mean, unfortunately that's one thing about hospital doctors. They're very narrow-minded. Should I put to that? Or maybe they're too specialized maybe put that."
"Yeah. So it's quite frustrating sometimes because you'll send someone to them and they'll say, ""Oh yes, the cardio has blah, blah, blah, blah."" And then they'll say, ""Oh."" They won't mention if there's anything else like COPD, like diabetes. They won't really mention it because they're not too sure themselves. Does that make sense? They're too specialized. Whereas someone like me would look at everything as a global nature and look at the patient as a whole. So, that's one of the things about general practice. Obviously, I wouldn't say I'm a specialist by any check of imagination, but I can still look at the patient as a whole person than a heart or a lung or a bowel. I think that's where hospital doctors are quite narrow-minded in that respect. They will only deal with their specialty and they won't generally veer into other specialties. They'd rather refer it than do anything about it."
"Yeah, exactly. I mean, might send back a letter, something like, ""oh, please, could you monitor their COPD? Are they having exacerbations?"" But they won't do anything about it. They'll just say, ""The patient's having a lot of exacerbations maybe,"" but that's all, they'll say. They won't say anything more than that. They will never stray beyond their  inaudible 00:26:21 ."
"I think that I mentioned it already that if the CPD is really bad and they're struggling to breathe and getting out of breath every 10 steps with their breathing, then that will put a lot of pressure on their heart. It will put their blood pressure up. It might give them tachycardia, things of that. So it can affect their heart in that respect. So obviously, it's in tandem where if someone's really getting severe angina they might get short of breath or same for COPD. They might put a lot more pressure on their heart, I think, say if they're struggling and they have frequent exacerbations, especially infection."
"I think it would definitely. I think the less strain you put on their heart, the better really. I mean, obviously you can't survive without your heart. So, if you can keep that going and keep it from getting too stressed, I think, definitely would improve their COPD and probably their quality of life as well."
"I think if they smoke or something or they have diabetes, obviously that thickens their blood. I don't know if you've seen those little models that GPS have with the thick blood, but basically the high blood pressure thickens your blood. And so does diabetes. So obviously if you've got thick blood, it's harder to carry oxygen. So that could affect the COPD and cause them to be more breathless. So that in that way, basically, it can affect it. So high blood pressure smoking, diabetes, they all thicken the blood. So I think obviously that would put a lot more pressure on the respiratory system because the blood isn't flowing as well, and they're not getting enough oxygen going through. And then you've got things like carbon monoxide and smoking causing the blood to be able to carry less oxygen in the first place as well. So, that would affect their COPD because they can't get their breath as well. So, that's probably where I would say that would probably affect it a lot more."
I'm pretty going to be completely wrong to everything I've said.
"What's the main? So these are obviously different studies, I take it, yeah, four studies. So, so 39% of COPD deaths are due to cardio. I'd probably agree with that. I'd probably say that's fair. I'd probably have said 50%."
"Yeah. I'd probably say a bit higher, but yeah. Obviously cancer's quite important as well. Isn't it there? So, obviously you get lung cancer as well."
"I mean, I think how high cancer is, and it's higher than cardiovascular actually. I was surprised the cancer is so high compared to cardiac, actually. But I suppose a lot of COPD patients are smokers, aren't they? So, that's probably why, but yeah. I probably would've said 39% is probably a fair figure and I'd probably agree with that."
"Okay. So individual COPD have two times greater risk of having cardiovascular disease. Fair enough because you've probably put your heart under a strain and increased risk of mortality. So if you have ischemic disease and COPD, then your risk is very high. I mean obviously having cardiac and COPD increases your risk a lot, but obviously if you just have cardiovascular disease, plus COPD. So what it's saying is if you have COPD and ischemic disease or heart failure, that it's a much greater risk compared to just having COPD."
"I think it's a little bit confusing. I understand what they're getting at. Obviously, if you just have say ischemic cardiovascular condition, your risk isn't that much increased. But if you have COPD and ischemic heart disease your risk is much, much higher. So I think that makes sense, but it does take a minute or two just to get your head around that."
"I think because obviously if you have COPD alone, it's less likely that you'd die of that. But obviously with cardiovascular, you're more likely to die just with the condition itself, but obviously COPD plus cardiovascular is a much bigger burden. So, if you imagine you've got cardiovascular disease on top of COPD, your risk is much, much higher of just having COPD. But if you have cardiovascular disease and you have COPD the other way around, so versus just having a cardiovascular condition, the risk isn't as high. So what they're saying is that the COPD alone, isn't a huge risk of mortality, but if you have COPD and ischemic heart disease, the risk is much, much higher. That's what I understand it as."
"It makes me think about the link between them, but as I said, it makes your head, it makes-"
"Yeah. Head spin a little bit, just because you're looking at both things in different ways, but it's quite similar-ish, I think. Probably I would get rid of the right side and just have the left side that would probably be more impactful than the right side as well, if that makes sense."
"Yeah. I mean, that's basically what I was saying, wasn't it? If you have an exacerbation, you are going to put a lot of pressure on your heart and you're more likely to have heart attacks and strokes and things, which is what I would expect. I mean, so it's two times the risk doubles after five days. I mean, that's quite interesting and risk of strokes, so yeah. So it is quite important, yeah."
"I would say risk in five days is actually quite a long usually. Your risk of having a heart attack within five days doubles. I mean we'd be eyeing up my COPD patients quite worryingly when I see them next to see if your heart's all right. I mean, I think obviously that MI within five days, risk doubling is actually quite, quite scary, actually. Risk of stroke within 10 days, I mean, obviously, most patients only have seven days of treatment. So hopefully they'll be better by time get to that point of increase. But the MI within five days, so they're still within treatment time. So that's a little bit worrying actually. Yeah."
"I think I've mentioned it already actually, but obviously with the exacerbation, they're struggling more to breathe. They're putting a lot of pressure on the heart. If you've already got a knackered heart, excuse the term, you're putting it under pressure. You've got narrowed coronary arteries. You've probably got tachycardia as well if putting a lot of pressure on the heart. Then you're more likely to number one, through off clots, which can cause them more than strokes or a number two, the heart will just get tired and then you'd have an MI."
"That's even more scary. Obviously, the severe exacerbation question, it would be probably like four times or something, but yeah, I mean, moderate exacerbation like a mild, obviously it's not severe. It's not mild, but it's a moderate. So your normal, probably run the mill patient has a moderate exacerbation rather than severe or a mild one. So, that's probably a bit more worrying actually."
"I think it just makes me think a bit more when I see a COPD patient with an exacerbation, should I be looking a bit more broadly rather than just throwing antibiotics and steroids at them? Or make me maybe check their blood pressure sure and check their heart rate, things like that a bit more."
"That's why I like doing these studies, because I learn things. All cause mortality. Okay. Okay. Right."
"Well, it says all cause mortality. It says obviously the reduction in mortality, 49% compared to just a LABA/LAMA. So obviously the P numbers is good as well, so .003. So that's quite good as well. So it's significant. I mean, they all cause death though. So it's not saying cardiac or respiratory, saying all cause death. So obviously it is a reduction, so that's good compared to LABA/LAMA. So that would make, consider Product X a bit more thoroughly compared to a LABA/LAMA."
"Mm, I probably actually like the triple therapy inhalers quite a lot, actually. I won't mention any names because I don't know which side you're on."
"Which one we're talking about. So I actually quite like them in many way and I think our prescriptions of them are actually going up quite a lot. I'm doing a lot more prescriptions for them because I think patients do very well on them actually. So it doesn't surprise me that much, but I think 49% is probably quite a big number. And I think that's probably what I would be more surprised by. That it is 49%. That's quite a big number, actually."
"I mean, I'm a bit surprised that LABA/LAMA is so bad compared to ICS and LABA. So, that's a bit surprising. I would expect to them be a little bit closer together. And then obviously Product X I would expect to be the best anyway, because it's a triple therapy. So I'd expected those to be a bit narrower, but I'm surprised, inhalent corticosteroids and LABA are very good. Not really because   00:41:21 . Pardon?"
"I think it's probably because of the steroids, isn't it really? I think it's probably just the ICS component is probably giving the patient some steroids. So, obviously that's probably making the lungs a bit less reactive. So probably more because of that, I think. So obviously, when you put all three together it's a very winning combination, isn't it?"
"I mean it's slightly high, but obviously if you look at say, I don't know, statins and things. I mean we throw statins at people and half of them don't get any benefit. So number needs to treat is 80s. Is it's a bit higher than I'd like, but again, with these things you do treat some people unnecessarily. But I think at the same time, if you get a 50% reduction for your patients, I think that's quite good. So obviously some patients may have it unnecessarily, but I think it's a little bit higher than I'd like, but it's not a deal breaker for me."
I'm probably not going to go tomorrow and change all my patients to triple therapy.
"No, no, no. Again, I think if I see a patient with cardiovascular disease, I may think of triple therapy a bit sooner. Probably that's what I'd say."
"I think going through the data with cardiovascular, seeing the previous side of the cardiovascular disease and the exacerbations, I think that's probably making me think anyone I see with cardiovascular disease, who's moderately bad, I might consider them to triple therapy bit sooner."
"Mm, okay. So it's saying cardiovascular causes compared to the majority of the mortality treatment. So, when this is all cause it's that cardiovascular is the bigger one. So if you look at say Product X, all cause 28, but 11 of those are cardiovascular. And obviously if you look at the LABA/LAMA, obviously cardiovascular death total is a lot higher, 15, 29 of those cardiovascular. So obviously you don't really want to use a LABA/LAMA in cardiovascular disease or those things. And, obviously for ICS LABA, I mean the only caveat I would say with this is the ICS-LABA. Obviously it has higher death rate, but the cardiovascular and the respiratory death toll is almost the same. And it says are there 11 other at the bottom for ICS-LABA. That's a little bit disappointing in a way when you look at that, because it does make you think, ""Okay, there's seven extra patients dying in ICS-LABA, but the cardiovascular death toll is almost the same as Product X."" So it doesn't really give you an anything impactful in that respect."
"Yeah. So I think, it just shows that obviously the LABA/LAMA is not very good for preventing cardiovascular deaths. So, you've got 29 of those deaths with cardiovascular. So, obviously the LABA/LAMA is no good really for preventing cardiac deaths, really basically. So obviously if I see a patient who's on LABA/LAMA, who's got cardiovascular disease I probably wouldn't consider it."
"The other thing I'd say for the ICS-LABA, there's a much higher rate of cancer deaths. So, there's almost five different between the other two products. So cancer obviously that would've been something that wouldn't have been affected by any of these drugs. So, it does sort of dilute the data a bit for the Product X because it doesn't  inaudible 00:46:30  then."
"So, let's look. Obviously with the LABA/LAMA, sorry, the major adverse cardiovascular events are much, much higher in confirmed  mace 00:46:59 . Obviously nonfatal MI is higher in LABA/LAMA. Weirdly nonfatal stroke is higher in Product X and the other two are better. But in cardiovascular death over all the LABA/LAMA is higher. So obviously LABA-LAMA is not so good for cardiovascular. But Looking at ICS-LABA, it's almost equivalent to the Product X in a lot of the areas. So again, it does dilute the data and makes you think LABA isn't that much worse. And if you're going to have Product X being much, much more expensive, would they say you have to use ICS-LABA at first in cardiovascular patients? So it's something to think about."
"Yeah. I mean, obviously I think LABA/LAMAs are going to be thrown out the window. Sorry. And I think Product X looks good, but I think ICS-LABA isn't bad actually either. It's not that bad. I think it's not as bad as the previous graph showed. There was a big, there was a difference between the two of those. Product X was better, but it's not greatly better looking at these charts."
"Yes. So, saying Product X showed a reduction cardiovascular versus LABA/LAMA. We know that don't we? But against ICS-LABA, what is that difference between Product X? so that would be interesting to know the figure for that. But obviously LABA/LAMA is a bad, bad, bad, bad thing in cardiovascular patients. So that's a big difference too, but unfortunately the ICS-LABA as I said, does skew you a little bit and make you think. Is it like 20% or 10%? What's the difference? So it'd be good to know that as well. I think you need to differentiate now between ICS and LABA and Product X."
"I think if it controls a COPD better, then I don't see why that wouldn't be the case because obviously with the medication if it controls COPD, less exacerbations, less pressure on the heart and the cardiovascular system, then that makes sense, really. If you're controlling the COPD better, then hand-in-hand, it would improve the cardiovascular presentation of patients as well. So it would just put less pressure on the whole system."
"Yeah. I mean, I think the very first chart you showed me with COPD and cardiovascular disease versus COPD alone, I mean, that was quite powerful, I thought. And that obviously made me think as a physician. Am I doing the right thing? So I think in that respect, yes it does. But I think the next few slides haven't convinced me, like I said, amazing. I'm convinced is good, but I would say that I would need to know the data between Product X and ICS-LABA a bit more to see what the difference is. Because it does seem there's quite good parity between the two, not brilliant, but it's not that much worse either in terms of reducing death."
"(Silence) Okay. So, obviously again, it looks good compared to the cardiovascular studies because it's better than most of them. Is Product Y another   00:52:12 ? You got two of them, obviously there today. Okay. Yeah. So again, it's saying it's LABA/LAMA but I think because LABA/LAMA is so terrible compared to this drug, it's the one in the middle. It'd be good to know how it was against ICS-LABA because you're using the worst one against the best one. But there's one in the middle isn't there, which you're not talking about. Sorry, I'm being naughty, I know."
"No, I'd be surprised actually. I mean, that's one thing I would say that definitely it is quite surprising that say versus, I don't know, like a statin or an ACE inhibitor that a patient with COPD could benefit that much cardiovascularly with a triple therapy. Obviously one triple therapy is better than the other. And obviously Product X is a better one, isn't it? So, yeah. I mean, it is surprising the magnitude really. Yes. That is the case."
"Yeah, I think it does. I mean, as I said, I think it probably will make me think more carefully about my patients' COPD and cardiovascular risk. And I probably will have a chat with my COPD nurse probably next week when I speak to her just about this. Because I think it's something that I probably wasn't aware of was that powerful in a way, especially I think the MI within five days of exacerbation. I mean, I think you're doubling the risk. I think that kind of thing will just more stick in my mind now, obviously when I see a patient with exacerbation. I just look into it a bit further, seeing what they're on and maybe consider triple therapy for their patient with severe cardiovascular disease and recurrent exacerbation."
"Yeah, probably, obviously I probably look more Product X than Product Y if I knew what they were."
"It may be, I don't know, maybe the dosages of the ICS or the type of LABA/LAMA used. It might be something like that. It's difficult to know which way around it is. So I probably need to look at the doses of the medications in Product X versus Product Y and just see. And maybe the inhaler type as well, because obviously one's a DPI and one's not, isn't it? So if I'm talking about the right two, I don't know. But that might have to do with compliance, taking the medication, getting more particles down into the lungs, getting better control. All these things might account for it as well."
"No, I think not. I mean, I think it's something which I think physicians should be made aware of, especially GPs. Cause obviously we deal with both in tandem. So probably education's quite important. As I said, I've learned something here today which I will probably take forward into my practice. So I think one of the things that is a problem is that we don't see reps anymore and trying to get the information out to doctors is quite difficult. And I think that's going to be an uphill struggle just because of the way we are not seeing people at the moment. We're not seeing reps as much to give us this information. So I think it's more education kind of thing actually that's needed."
"I'm not saying education, but obviously it made me think. That's something which is important so you know how things work. For instance, SGLT2s are good for heart failure, things like that. Those kinds of things are interesting to know and it doesn't change practice, but it just makes you more aware."
"No, thank you. Thank you. And you've been very good to moderator as well. So I've had a lot of fun, so that was good."
"Right, right, right. So I've been practicing cardiology. I do it in a fairly rural area of the country. I do do mostly general cardiology, so anything from echo stress test, outpatient, inpatient, a little bit of everything. I work through a hospital based facility, about a 300 bed facility, that covers the gamut of almost all cath, EP, cardiac surgery, et cetera, et cetera, even though it is in a rural area."
"In a typical month, between probably 200 to 300."
"Sure. I mean, generally my demographic is age, probably, 50 to 60. I'll be honest, overweight, Caucasian. It's still a good amount of smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type-2 diabetes, that type of stuff."
Hyperlipidemia. Smoking is still prevalent. Type-2 diabetes.
"For this demographic, because it still exists, it's probably a combination of tobacco and obesity."
"So I work as a consultant, so I don't directly, for the most part, for the most part, I don't directly deal with their diabetic medications. I will make recommendations. The only caveat to that is heart failure, where there's newer drugs that are being recommended for the SGL2 inhibitors for heart failure. But in general, I more check that it's under control and make recommendations, but I don't actually, well, I try not to actively manage their diabetes. Usually that's done by either their primary care doctor or by their endocrinologist."
"So, mainly I'm seeing them for cardiovascular symptoms and if there's a major problem with it then I guess I'll be like, ""Hey, what's going on here?,"" if their diabetes is out of control and stuff like that. Like I said, very rarely will I actively manage their diabetes. So it's more like keeping an eye on it to making sure they're on like the right stuff and making sure it's not for some reason slipping under the crack, but usually I'm not actively managing their diabetes. Usually I'm actively just involved with their cardiac care."
"So of non-cardiac stuff, it's more peripheral vascular disease, because that's in the realm of cardiology is I'll be a bit more active in. I mean, hypertension, if we wanted to count that, I'm a little bit more active in. I'm sure there's some other stuff that's not coming to me. But diabetes, I keep an eye on, and stuff like that. Various blood thinners, like anticoagulation, I'll keep because that interacts with cardiovascular stuff. Blood thinners, if it's for something even like a DVT or PE, I will actively manage those just because they can have cross reactivity with cardiovascular stuff. I think that's it. Kind of a broad question."
"It's like, besides the heart, pick every other organ and do you manage it? So it's a little bit of a broad question."
"Right, right, right. So short of breath, which is pretty often that they come to a cardiologist for a shortness of breath, so my role in their shortness of breath is because there's going to be many reason to be short of breath, but my job would be to figure out are there any cardiac reasons for shortness of breath? Which for me then starts with basic physical exam history and then usually they end up with an echo or a stress test. Just so I can rule that out just to make sure the shortness of breath is not from heart failure or coronary artery disease. So that's where really I do it is, can I rule out is this shortness of breast cardiovascular, and if so where in the cardiovascular tree is it?"
"Respiratory, to be honest, not a lot. Not a lot. Because usually that's already been done. Usually that's already been done in terms of a chest x-ray, in terms of PFTs, in terms of CAT scans. Then again, so if I start ordering that stuff, I become responsible for it, and that's honestly not my specialty."
"So let's say I do a CAT scan of their lungs, and now I'm going to just make it up a lung nodule, that's not my area of expertise in what to do next. As an ordering doctor, I'm not responsible for those studies in terms of the management of it. I wouldn't want a pulm doctor or a lung doctor ordering a stress test and then trying to interpret it and going for there. So very, very rarely."
"In the hospital, sure, someone needs a chest x-ray, let's do all of this. Or they need a CAT scan, right? Usually when I'm doing a CAT scan it's more vascular if you're looking for a PE or plural effusion and stuff like that. But in the outpatient world, I almost never. In the inpatient world-"
I would at least get a chest x-ray. I would think about PFT. I wouldn't go anything beyond that because then I become responsible for it.
"I would send them back to either their primary care doctor, or does the person need a pulmonologist, and stuff like that?"
"Because let's say hypothetically I do their PFTs and they have asthma, right? I'm not an asthma doctor, and nor should I be."
"Usually refer back to the primary is 90% of it. Also, because like I said, in rural places, the primaries are a little bit more, we don't have a lot of specialists, so it's like, ""Hey, I found out that they have a lung nodule or asthma, are you comfortable handling this or should we... ?"", and go from there. Because it's a little bit out of my comfort zone."
"That's very high, because not every shortness of breath is cardiovascular. So the next best reason for someone to be short of breath is usually their lungs. So usually my job is to tease out is it the heart, and if it's not the heart, could it possibly be the lungs that are causing the shortness of breath? That's usually next on my differential. It's usually the classic fight between the pulmonologist and the cardiologist. No, they are short of breath because of this. No, you're short of breath because of this. So that's very common."
"So then they would need additional imaging, right? I know my imaging, so if they have established cardiovascular disease, I would first make sure that it's still not my organ system with my studies, right? Echo would be a big one, plus or minus stress testing, plus or minus capping them and stuff like that. That's coming back all negative or not very dramatic, then I would start at least being like, ""Hey, is this a lung problem and do we need to do more lung investigations?"", and start the COPD workup, like I said."
"Now, whether that's me or the hospitalist or something like that, honestly, what I would probably do is if it was in the hospital, I would probably would be like, ""Listen, I've done my cardiovascular workup, it's pretty much benign, but they're still having shortness of breath or whatever."" I would probably be like, ""Do we need to do more additional lung imaging? Do we need to do a CAT scan? Do we need to do   00:12:45 ?"
"Again, that's something usually another practitioner handles."
"Because again, it comes back to if I start ordering that, then I'm -"
"Correct. Correct. Or maybe they get the imaging or they start the imaging. I would make, this is actually last week, an example of this, where I basically was like, ""I've ruled out cardiovascular disease in this patient. We should get a pulmonologist out to further investigate the pulmonologist."""
"The other reason for that also is, listen, that's not my area of expertise, so I might not order the exact test that they would want with contrast, without contrast. There are nuances to the lung studies that I'm not an expert but that we do have experts. So what if I order a test and that ends up being not the right test and we have to redo the test, we just wasted everyone's time. So to me, it's just better to have the experts now investigate and do what testing they need to do."
"Probably around the same, 25% to 30%. Yeah, I'd say it's about the same."
It would either their primary care or their pulmonologist.
It's basically the same because the COPD symptoms can mimic cardiac symptoms. So if you do have-
It doesn't impact it too much. Maybe a little bit with medications that I would use. Specifically   00:15:36 .
"Beta blockers. Beta blockers are used a lot in cardiology, but they can make COPD and asthma worse. So that is a one example if you have severe COPD or severe asthma, I will tend to then not use beta blockers and so forth. Same thing applies to cardiac testing modalities. There are certain types of stress testing, like nuclear  inaudible 00:16:05  stress testing that if you're in the middle of an asthma or COPD layer, you shouldn't do that test. If you have COPD, but are controlled, you can still get a stress test, but if you're actively wheezing, you should not get that type of stress test. So that is in the diagnostic modality of it. Yeah, and so forth."
"Being on oxygen also limits some of the other testing you can do. If you're on oxygen it's probably not a good idea to put you on a treadmill for an exercise stress test. Then the other part is like, again, if is this a COPD exacerbation versus a CHF exacerbation? That's more of a broader thing is like if they do have concomitant COPD, the game now becomes is your shortness of breath this time either COPD or is it some heart failure or some combination of both?"
"I'm fairly comfortable because, like I said, it's not uncommon to have both. But how it usually works in our system is that, at least in the inpatient world, a patient gets admitted with some shortness of breath, oftentimes, whether that's right or wrong, they'll consult a pulmonologist and a cardiologist. A lot of times you just end up treated for both at the same time. It's a little bit of a shotgun approach where you get treated for heart failure and COPD at the same time. So again, I don't usually actively manage the COPD part of it. I often see the meds just to make sure there's no interactions and everything is looking okay, but usually someone else is managing that part. I'm comfortable enough to least co-manage with it."
"Correct. Very rarely will I initiate the COPD treatment. Very rarely will I start the steroids, will I start that or the Azithromycin or whatever it may be. Sure, maybe I've done it handful of times, but very rarely am I managing that. I will, like I said, give recommendations. I'll be like, ""Maybe we should treat the COPD more aggressively,"" and then I'll leave it up to either the hospitalist or the pulmonologist, whatever they decide how to do it."
"Fairly concerned, because it's part of the differential, at least if we're talking about shortness of breath. So it very well could be this could all be from there, so I have to be fairly concerned that this is COPD or worsening COPD. A lot of the risk factors for COPD and cardiac disease overlap so treating one is often treating the other."
"Well, I mean, things like smoking cessation works for both, so that's a common one, or sleep apnea, which a lot of COPDers also have, those affect both organ systems. So a lot of times treating the cardiovascular disease also indirectly also treats the lung disease."
"Oh, well, indirectly or directly. Like I said, smoking cessation, it directly affects both."
"Yeah. So in terms of active medicines, probably no. But smoking cessation is part of, at least to me, the therapy of cardiovascular disease. If you continue to smoke, you'll continue to have cardiovascular problems. That's like the number one thing. The same thing, it's been a while since I studied COPD, but I'm still  inaudible 00:20:58  that smoking is a big part of COPD management as well."
So that's what I mean by overlapping modalities.
"But no, there's not like treating directly with inhalers has no direct effect on their cardiovascular status, and putting a stent into their heart doesn't really directly affect their COPD. They are separate entities in that respect."
"Well, no one specifically tells me. It is either a conclusion that I or the other doctors will come up with. Like I said, if they're coming in wheezing with no other cardiac problems, then I myself will be like, ""This is likely COPD than heart failure."" Or sometimes it will already be done for me. It'll be seen by the inpatient doctor and then they'll either be like, ""This is a COPD exacerbation, but we just want you to check in on their heart stuff."" So in that regard it's already-"
"I would. I would. I would. Because if their cardiovascular part is controlled but their COPD isn't, then I need to have a conversation with whoever's managing their COPD. I'm like, ""Listen, this is not the heart, but they're still short of breath, they're still doing this. We need to do additional work because we've ruled out the heart."" So I will, because it helps in management, helps them keep them out of the hospital, et cetera, et cetera."
"So I will because a lot of my questions also center around shortness of breath and shortness of breath on exertion and/or chest pain. So a lot of those things. If you're still telling me you're short of breath or it's worsening, but I've also done all I can from a heart standpoint, then I will ask them, ""Well, how is your COPD being controlled? Has it been controlled? How many times have you needed steroids?"" If all those questions are leading me that way, then I have to be like, ""All right, we have to get this under control because I don't think the shortness of breath is heart related."""
"Kind of. Yeah, right. So since I don't directly treat or very rarely do I treat the COPD, no, it makes a difference in terms of, like I said, medications, and specifically things like beta blockers. It's the first thing that comes into mind, because although that is beneficial for your heart, that's not so great for your COPD. So that's the first thing that I would advise or manage. There's alternatives to those meds that won't make COPD worse. That's the main   00:24:44 ."
"I personally do not. I personally do not. There's nothing really that comes to me that I would. Like I said, to me, mostly it's treated with steroids, at least in the hospital, maybe some antibiotics, some inhalers, and as far as I know, or at least as I'm thinking, none of those really interferes with my side of the equation."
"Maybe steroids and heart failure can kind of do some stuff, but most of the COPD treatments, at least that I'm aware of, don't really cross over, at least to my side of it. So I let them do what they need to do."
"It can often almost be exactly like cardiovascular stuff because with shortness of breath, shortness of breath on exertion, chest pain, chest pain on exertion, low decreased exercise tolerance, those you can say for both categories. So it will often mimic cardiac disease, which is why it's so difficult, not terribly difficult, but difficult to tease out what is what. Which is why, like I said, a lot of times they get treated for both at the same, at least initially, until it's teased out what exactly is going on. So they often mimic each other."
"They're often treated for both until more testing and imaging is done, right? So from my side of the equation, it will be mostly echo is a big part of it, echo and stress testing. Then the other side of it, which I see happen all the time, is more the pulm part, which is chest imaging, CAT scans, et cetera, et cetera. Then with the combination of both, you can at least lean one way or another."
"Question. It would if the COPD is related to emphysema from tobacco use. Then it definitely would, excuse me, because that's a risk factor that I still see that affects both systems. Otherwise, I'll be honest, I don't see... Otherwise, there's not a real, if you take that out of it, but then if you take that out of it then you're left with non-emphysema related to COPD, which is rare. So on its own, I don't see it being a risk factor, but like I said, that would be very rare to have COPD not influenced by tobacco, and tobacco influences both, if that makes sense."
"Well, if you have well-managed COPD, that's obviously a good thing and it would help your cardiovascular health because you'd be less short of breath, you'd be able to do all the things your cardiologist wants you to do in terms of exercise and diet and all that other stuff. If you are consistently short of breath from your COPD, you're not going to be able to do all the stuff that the cardiologist wants you to do."
"So well-managed COPD then you do have better lifestyle, I think, in terms of your managing your cardiac risk factors. Because I led off with this saying that things like obesity and all this other stuff are also a big part of my comorbidities, which is difficult to manage if you're consistently short of breath, then you don't have your COPD well-managed and it's hard to attack those other cardiac risk factors."
"Yeah. So I mean if you don't have well-managed cardiovascular disease specifically in terms of heart failure, if your lungs are already a little bit compromised and then you're consistently having heart failure exacerbations and more fluid in the lungs and stuff like that, I mean, I'm sure that's also not helping. So keeping your lungs dry in that respect is always beneficial in that respect. Because if it's not well-managed and you're having chronic heart failure or worsening heart failure with your COPD, no matter how well your COPD is managed, if you keep on having heart disease you're still going to be short of breath. So it's like a combination of the two."
"Sure. Sure. If you have worsening cardiovascular disease leading to worsening heart failure, it's going to be hard to get the COPD under control if the pulmonary vasculature is always overloaded and full of fluid. So maybe not directly, like it's not going to directly worsen the COPD, but it's going to make you short of breath like COPD and it's always going to be hard to tell."
"The same thing can be done the other way around. If the COPD is not well-managed it's not going to directly affect the heart in that respect, it's not like going to cause you to have a heart attack, it's just going to make you just incredibly short of breath and so forth. The cardiologist can only do so much with the hard stuff if it's not well managed."
"But again, the tying factor to both of them is usually tobacco use is the one that leads you to both of them."
"It will. It will. It will. Because you can manage one, great, but if the other side of it is not, then the patient will still be short of breath. They're not going to do well if only one is managed well. It has to be managed in tandem."
"I mean, to me, it's not terribly surprising. It's basically saying that cardiac and cancer related deaths represent a substantial... I mean, if you have COPD, the odds state you will probably pass away either from lung cancer or from some type of cardiac disease. Usually that's tobacco related. Like I said, it's hard to find COPD, severe COPD, that didn't happen from substantial tobacco abuse. But that also significantly affects your cardiac risk factors and so forth. So what is it, 39% of COPD were due to cardiovascular events? Yeah, I'm surprised it's not 50%."
Yeah. Also not surprising at least to me because-
"Well, because the common risk factor for both of these disease states is tobacco use. So again, systemic heart disease is very well established with tobacco use and so is COPD. So again, tying two and two together, especially with my patient population, which is still a substantial tobacco use population, not surprising that you have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease when you have concomitant COPD."
"I mean, the other part of this is I think we didn't really touch on is if people need surgeries and pre-op clearance for surgeries COPD makes them a little higher risk to go to the OR because they're on ventilators. For a surgery, you are put on a heart and lung machine for a short amount of time, and if your cardiovascular situation is weak and now your lungs are weak, your risk for surgery, for any type of surgery, is a little bit higher than normal. So I'm sure some of the mortality is also linked to surgical mortality. When you have compromised lungs, like I said, that's also a risk factor for pre-op clearance."
"This does. It does. So at least at the first part where it says the risk of MI doubles with within five days. So any stress on the body increases your risk of MI. So if you have a moderate lung exacerbation, or it doesn't have to be a lung exacerbation, you're at risk of heart attack. Like I said, any stress on the body increases your risk of MI. Did I know it was actually double? No. But I do know that your incidence rate, like I said, does increase from across any other side."
"The stroke thing I did not know. 40% increase of stroke. Although, I'll be honest, those numbers, I'm assuming they're statistically relevant. But when you say 1.4 to 1.7, I'd have to actually look at that if that's actually statistically relevant just because those numbers are so small. But the stroke thing, I didn't know. About the MI one, I did."
But I would not link the COPD exacerbations and strokes. That news to me.
"Right. So if that truly is statistically relevant, then it puts a little bit on it. Obviously we don't want people having strokes in the hospital, so that leads me to be a little bit more aggressive or at least aware about controlling the COPD part of it if it truly is COPD. Like let's say it's a shortness of breath and I've ruled out the cardiovascular standpoint and all this other stuff, but it would make me be a little bit more like, ""Hey, let's try get this under control.""   00:40:38 ."
"How I practice, not much, because very rarely am I doing COPD on my own. But it would be probably a little bit more increased dialogue, more assertiveness to the people who do treat it."
"Sure, sure, I've gone through it. The only caveat to this is, or maybe I can get it clarified, it says product X shows a nonsignificant 28% reduction. So nonsignificant means it was not statistically significant? So it's a 28% reduction-"
"So that's a P value of 0.1. So correct me if I'm wrong, although that shows a 28% reduction, that's not a statistically significant reduction, so that's fine-"
Right. Right. I see. Right. So that's great. I'm just telling you when you present it and this gets presented to physicians they're going to jump all over that because that means that some of the reduction is actually due the chance and not the medication because it's a non-significant 28% reduction.
"That is 49%. So that is under just a P value 0.03. So that is significant. Right. Right. So that is significant. So statistically significant versus LABA LAMA, but not statistically significant versus inhaled cortical steroids and LABA."
"No, no, it is. It is. It is. It is. That makes more sense when you look at that chart because there's a bigger difference obviously between those. So this one, I mean, it should be something more. I mean, I don't see a downside to using it. It's reducing mortality definitely better than the LABA LAMA standpoint of it. I can't say for sure it's better than the ICS LABA part of it, but it's definitely better than LABA LAMA."
"Yeah. I mean, I would say it's useful because everyone aims for reductions in all causes of mortality."
"Yeah, it does. It does. It does. But at the end of the day is it going to compel me to write the script for it, again, like I said, I just don't manage the COPD and the nuances of COPD. Would it lead me to have the discussion, be like, ""Hey, should we try this?"" Yes."
"But like I said, as me as a consultant, I know I also don't want to set the precedent of me now writing for and managing people's COPD. So what's likely to happen-"
"It would. It would. What it would be, the conversation would be like, ""Hey, I'm happy to treat their cardiovascular part of this, et cetera, et cetera,"" and then it would change the discussion. It's like, ""Do you think this is COPD? Should we be using that product X for the treatment of their COPD? Then I'll leave it up to them. I'll leave it up to the experts, right? ""I heard about this, do you think this is something we should be trying or should be using?"" Then I would document it also in my notes. I'd be like, ""Listen, should consider use of product X for treatment of COPD exacerbation,"" if the evidence is compelling."
"Yeah. So the numbers are showing that you have reduced major cardiovascular events when treated with product X to a statistical relevance. The only caveat to that is that these numbers are still fairly small in terms of major. We're talking about 28 to 11 deaths over a course of 2000 people, which sounds like a lot, but I mean, 11 to 28 in the grand scheme of things, these are small numbers. Before we jump to all kind like kinds of crazy conclusions, not crazy conclusions, but definitive conclusions, to me, I would need to see a little bit more data. I mean, we're confusing, like I said, 11 deaths to 28 deaths, and the nature-"
"Well, I mean, we're talking about more numbers, more power, in a sense."
"Like I said, this is still relatively small in terms of big studies. Like I said, to convince cardiologists you're just going to have to have more definitive data. Because like I said, if I'm noticing that, someone else will also notice that too. Because that's essentially the home, everything else is kind of the same. Non-fatal MI is a little is better. Stroke, it doesn't really make that much a difference as well."
"Also, part of this is like so some of this is presenting that they're dying from cardiac death, but these people also have usually multiple other comorbidities. At the end of the day, when people sign death certificates, I mean, you can make an argument that almost everyone died from cardiac death when their heart stops. So some of this is like, all right, well these people had comorbidities, and then how was that documentation done, et cetera, et cetera?"
"But all in all, like I said, but the numbers here still are significant, that use of this seems to at least these help or lower, even if it's insignificantly, it's at least lowering some of their cardiac risk factors or risk of cardiac death. Cardiac death specifically is like the main thing that   00:50:30 ."
"But these numbers are so small, the rest of it, seven, eight, and six, I mean, that could be chance as well. That's what I was talking about, these numbers are so small, I mean, if two more people died of respiratory death, then that swings this chart. Not swings it, but do you know what I mean? If two more people who weren't taking of the ICSs and you made that number four and you made respiratory nine on the treatment modality, then now you do have significant. So just one or two patients-"
"Right. Right. So that's why that part still makes sense. But like I said, my problem, not my problem, with it is that assuming so even if I swung the deaths like five deaths, then the numbers are still small enough to where, like I said, I'm not sitting here doing the math and the statistics. But no, but enough to at least be like, oh, there's something at least that needs further investigation. Because there is something from at least 29 to eight is significant, that's probably the biggest number on there. Because in the LABA LAMA there were whatever, 29 cardiovascular deaths and eight respiratory, and that's like the biggest jump, whereas that number goes down to 11 to seven with use of product X."
"So although to me there's no real, as of now, I have not seen any downside. So it's working in some respect even if it's not statistically significant. So there's no downside and it's preventing cardiac death, then go for it. Let's go for it."
"Even if it's a statistically significant, to really drive the point home, cardiologists are very data driven people. They're going to have to be driven home convincingly. If the ultimate goal is to try to get cardiologists to be more active in COPD management it's really going to have to be driven home, because I'll be honest, most of them don't want to. We stick to our system and don't want to cross over."
"Yes. Yeah, because that number is more convincing and more statistically significant. Because that's saying from LABA LAMA, those numbers can't be denied. Like I said, I think, oh, that's a big difference. That is a big difference. Especially if we tease it back to when they were talking about the rate of MI doubles in the first five days. So if we can get that under control better there seems to be at least a linkage between both. So yeah, that one is a little bit more powerful, I think."
"I mean, it very well could. It very well could. Like I said, there's linkages between the two. There's linkages that are also not quite understood. So if there is something that is able to cross react and treat the other, then that's fine. The current paradigm is that, like I said, most cardiologists, they're currently not managing COPD, at least in my experience."
And that is what most cardiologists think. Now that-
"So then it could, right. That would change some of the thinking because right now that's just not in the paradigm of how we think about things. Now, if there was something that is, then it would change the thinking. It would be like, ""Well, why aren't we using something like this which would actually help out our system as well?"" So it would change the system, because right now that is not how that world thinks of it."
"So this is really targeting cardiologists, right? Because it's targeting all the meds that we give religiously and saying that the treatment, that this is just as good or better, or at least product X is versus product Y. Product X is because the number needed to treat is the lowest out of all of them."
"So this is trying to drive that this is just basically that even though you guys aren't, you should be at least thinking about it in terms of mortality and so forth."
"I am surprised at least at product X seems to is, at least in this slide, leading to the greatest reduction, the percent reduction, of all the meds out there. Right? Especially compared to statin inhibitors. Like I said, all the cardiac meds. So that's surprising. That is surprising that it is potentially that impactful in terms of cardiovascular stuff."
"Well, like I said, usually cardiologists are not in the inhaler world at all, and this at least, like I said, if all this data's currently validated, all this other stuff, then it puts it at least in the ballpark. We would be doing an injustice if we weren't now looking at their inhalers and are they on the proper inhalers and so forth. It would change at least the paradigm a little bit."
"Right. It would be very similar to the SGL2 inhibitor, which is actually on this slide, which is actually a diabetic. I think I mentioned it very, very early."
"It's a diabetic that's been a little bit talking about in heart failure and stuff like that. So the paradigm has become a little bit like I'm highly recommending it for people and so forth. So it would be along those lines. I do think if we're basing it off the numbers we saw here, I think before that jump is really made, this is just my opinion, it would need a little bit more numbers in terms of validating all that stuff."
"Because like I said, if I'm looking at it and thinking like that then I'm sure someone else is as well. Before that jump, it just to me seems too small. A little bit too small, even though statistically relevant, to now change everything. Not change everything, but you know."
"Hello, and thank you. The respondent is now on the line. Moderator  Mandy 00:00:07  go ahead please."
"I'm a board certified family medicine physician working in private practice. Three other physicians, they are also family medicine doctors, and we are independent group. We are not affiliated with any other organization seeing patients."
"Typically, middle aged to elderly and severity of disease or severities are mild, some moderate, some severe, probably more in the moderate side and relatively less mild or less severe."
"Well, it's indicated for someone who has more than two exacerbation of the COPD per year with hospitalization. So they're typically the patients who are experiencing frequent flareups and they are also getting hospitalized because of their flareups or the end-stage disease. And you exhausted or your other options, and then they have to be in three different drugs."
"Well, history and physical exam. Obviously shortness of breath can come from zillions of reasons. It not necessarily lung, but it can be a cardiac code. Someone will walk in with shortness of breath, I will take a history, especially a cardiac history, but also social history, smoking history, of any environmental exposure, if there is any co-existing allergies, if there are co-existing asthma, and then a physical exam, looking for any edema, listening to their heart, lungs and then do testing chest x-ray. Do the echo labs, especially the B type, not  inaudible 00:04:44 . And then if I do suspect that it's something of a lung origin, or if they have a history of smoking or asthma, then I would do lung function studies."
"I would order the tests and then wherever they would go. I mean, we are not performing anything other than local blood draw and the chest x-ray, anything that's more advanced, like a 2D echo or pulmonary function testing, they would go to the hospital."
"For shortness of breath? Yeah, pulmonary embolism. So if I suspect PE, then I would get a D-dimer, would do a lung CT or a venous Doppler of the lower  inaudible 00:05:58 . What else can give you shortness, but obviously infections. So if I suspect an infection, it can be COVID, then I would do test."
"No, again, I can order all the tests so it's not going to be done in our office, but I can just put an order into the hospital system and then they will do a 2D echo, so..."
"Yeah, I do workup unless it's an intervention, if someone need Coronary catheterization, then that's done by cardiology, also lung biopsy.   00:06:39  But anything that primary care can order, I can order that and then I   00:06:44 ."
"Depending on the type of cardiovascular disease, and if it's someone who has coronary artery disease in the need of... If there is enormous stress test, we will reversible defect and I would refer the patient to cardiology for revascularization. If it's... Depending on if it's  CHR 00:07:11 , depending on the stage of the CHR, I would start to manage it on my own. But if it's beyond what I can do or what I feel comfortable with, again, I'm going to refer the patient to cardiology. If it's... Yeah."
"So if it's a PE with unstable vitals, then I would hospitalize the patient and then the hospital has to take over. So it all depends on the diagnosis and the severity of the problem."
"I would start treating them. I would get a lung function study, and then depending on a stage, I would start them on an inhaler, educate them about smoking cessation, try to put them on Chantix, or walk them to their smoking cessation path and then just start treating them."
"It depends on how bad their problem is. How many... I would... how many flare ups. It's based on certain criteria, the GOLD criteria, the number of flare ups per year and the present of hospitalization. So I would try to put them into one of the categories, which is sometimes not that easy, but then I would rather start aggressively and step it down, so..."
"100% if you consider smoking as a comorbidity, then I really cannot think about anyone else who doesn't have at least a smoking or ongoing smoking or heavy smoking history, or... So typically is a disease of some underlying problem."
"Nicotine dependence, anxiety, hypertension, heart failure, those are the most common ones."
Advanced heart disease and poorly controlled diabetes. And of course continued smoking. I would put smoking as number one most concerning and all the other after that.
"Okay. For like... Again, smoking is definitely top of my priority that I address it every visit. And then in terms of my diabetes and heart disease, again, it depends on the severity. If someone is  inaudible 00:10:35  of insulin, I don't really feel comfortable with that, then I will send the patient to endocrinology. They are an oral medications only, or just the ones  inaudible 00:10:47  I'm okay with that. Again, with core disease, depending on their stage, if it's like mild  DHF 00:10:53  again, I try to manage that if it's more advanced, then it's cardiology. Cancer, if they are on a cancer treatment. Again, I don't take. I don't manage that. Immunosuppressant state, again that's something that's managed by a specialist, like a rheumatoid arthritis type of thing. But like I mentioned mild cases of diabetes, stage one or two heart failure, I manage that on my own."
"I view it as a potential risk factor for morbidity and mortality, but it's a relatively, it doesn't really pay, I mean, maybe someone who has some kind of tachycardia syndrome and albuterol, whether I'm choosing albuterol  inaudible 00:12:01  I would say it's a minor issue in terms of prescribed COPD medications."
"90%. Smoking itself is a risk factor, obesity is a risk factor. So at least 90% if not 100."
"No, they are seen more frequently and I try to manage them more aggressively. There is one big thing that I would mention those patients are typically or the on 10 plus medications. And I... So you have to take into consideration the medical, the medication burden, and the more medication you prescribe, the more likely there is a drug interaction, or the more likely the patients would not take... forget to take their medications. So once we are getting to a point that patients has much comorbidities, they are on 10 plus medications. I'm not a big fan of adding an additional medication, especially if the effect of that medication is small."
"And I would always ask my patients that you are already taking 12 drugs. There is this other medication that by guidelines, it's going to help, but is it really  inaudible 00:14:27  for you to take a 13th medication? And sometimes they would say, no."
"It's... and the problem with combined medications is cost. So yes, there are combi... So  inaudible 00:14:51  and combined blood pressure and cholesterol, but they are not going to be as cheap as the singular agent generics."
"The more underlying comorbidities you have, or the more severe those are the higher the risk is. Yes, you are... I think the COPD plus  inaudible 00:15:32  disease on the top of them, a COPD exacerbation puts you at a much greater risk of dying or hospitalization.  inaudible 00:15:40  it is."
I would have a lower threshold of hospitalization or treatment.
"Frequent hospitalizations, non respondent to oral furazolidone or oral  inaudible 00:16:16  in general. So lack of response or just frequent unable... if I'm unable to control their shortness of breath, for example."
Something that they would discover. I mean   00:16:52 
"Only going to treat the heart, so if during the workup or whatever the encounter, if they do a... let's say they do a cardiac CT and there is a nodule on the lung. Yeah. I would get the message. There-"
"Take care of it. Yeah. Maybe they would just refer the patient to pulmonology bypassing, so it can go either depending on what the nature problem is."
Cardiologist is not going to take care of their COPD management. So they will take care of just only the heart related issues. And then I will continue to see COPD management business as usual.
Electronic medical record? It's going to be a message from the  inaudible 00:17:57 .
"Well, I would start with lifestyle. So obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity, that's all going to put you on high risk of just in general poor health with  inaudible 00:18:36  lung and heart disease. So start from the basics."
"Smoking is going to cause heart disease. It's  inaudible 00:18:53  in the arteries and it's going to destroy your functional lung tissue as well. Obesity is just going to put a higher metabolic demand on you. And it's also going to lead to heart disease. And again, lack of physical activity. That's also just an increased risk for diabetes. So I would see the three things as in combined together. One is influencing the other and just adds on as an additive factor, COPD is typically a disease and also Coronary artery disease, which is really, should be prevented by everyone by adopting healthy lifestyle."
"A great deal. It's going to... Yeah, if your oxygen level is good and your lung is functioning well then is going to put less strain on your heart."
"Probably it can go vice versa as well. Yeah. I don't know. I'm a clinician, I don't know, my part of mechanism and the pathology of the disease."
"I really cannot tell if it's the cardiovascular disease or some other reason. When they come in with a certain symptom  inaudible 00:21:03  any shortness of breath who knows, I really don't know. They might-"
"But I don't as a... when I'm formulating the treatment plan or when I put them on steroids, I don't really think about the connection between the two."
So is it real data or is it just make up?
"Well, you need to put it in the context of the general population. So it's presenting me real data, but it doesn't compare it against anything. So it shows me four studies, all of them in the COPD population describing the related deaths in the four categories, but something is missing, is the compilation of general population. So how does it compare to a population who does not have COPD or to healthy persons without any underlying lung condition? In itself, it's not really informative."
"Population, cardiac related deaths and cancer is going to be very high anyway. So really the question is how to defer to compared to a non COPD population? I mean, is it more the distribution different? So again-"
"Yeah, there's a great difference between studies and some of the studies that aspirated related is 45 and another one it's only eight. And so the variability of the data between the different studies are just huge and you cannot really draw a simple  inaudible 00:25:15  because it's..."
"We wonder what was different in the study setting to come to these widely different outcomes. Some studies, the respiratory related is the more than the number one and then another it's the least. So again, I don't know what to do with this data."
"Well, it follows up on which was already discussed that the two conditions are kind of related to each other, and one is augmenting the detrimental effect of the other one. So if having the two together confirms a greater risk of mortality, then having only one condition without the other one."
"Thought about this, but I'm not surprised. I mean, I would expect that."
" inaudible 00:28:30  stroke and heart attack as the COPD exacerbation. The only thing I try to think about it, what they want to achieve with this. Are there going to be any difference in the treatment algorithm or really what makes me think what the real intention. Are they going to give the drug that's going to treat both conditions or because I don't know how my treatment approach is going to defer after seeing this data."
Other than maybe more aggressive on the treatment side.
Again? I have never thought about that I don't question the data. It's believable.
"I talks about the increase in the risk of stroke and not the actual number of strokes. So the data that's shown here is... Though, I just found it as a little manipulative and a little distorted that they are not saying that the number of patients having stroke increased by whatever percentage. They are talking about an increased risk. That has that increased risk actually translates into a number of patients dying or getting hospitalized or having a bad outcome. And it, again, kind of a red flag for me that why they are talking about the risk and not the actual cases."
How what  inaudible 00:30:27  moderate exacerbation?
"Prescription of oral steroids, oral antibiotic. Okay. So it's like an outpatient treatment. What they mean... Okay. So what should I do about it? So what's your recommendation? What should I be doing differently than what I'm doing already?"
"Yeah. You remember the time when  omeprazole 00:31:50  went generic at 20 milligram? I forget the company and the company came up with  maxim 00:31:56 , which was the exact thing as omeprazole, but is the mirror form of the molecule with a higher dose. And they compared the 20 milligram of their, or 20 milligram products with the 40 milligram of a new product. And they came out with the data that the 40 milligram is more effective than the 20 milligram. Therefore, you should be prescribing the new branded medication. This is the same. They are comparing apples against oranges. They try to prove me that product X, which is not the same as the Lama LABA combination, because it has an added inhaled corticosteroid, it is better than the other two. So it's... I look at it and I smile and laugh because it's so obvious that they just try to sell this product and the data is not useful at all because they are not comparing the same treatments."
"Really a selling point for them would be, is to compare a Lama LABA combination with a genetic in inhaled steroid. And then if product X is superior compared to that I would prescribe product X, but this is intentional. They created a study where less treatment is compared with more treatment. And then proving that the more treatment adding the inhaled corticosteroid is better. This is just-"
"Well, I'm already doing that, but it doesn't make me to use product X because that's more expensive and I can just add a genetic health steroid to the Lama LABA and then it's going to be... A patient is going to be much happier with less copay. So it's... I don't know what to tell. It's just plain stupid. I mean, I..."
"Told me that the product is better than adding a... That would be a real selling point, but I think they are afraid to do the study. And to me as a physician if they don't present me the data, that's a sign that their product is really not superior, than just adding an inhaled steroid, because-"
"Yeah. It's a very confusing data for me that I should be adding a genetic inhaled steroid on the top of the LABA Lama combination. I'm not going to use a $200 copay on whatever product, just because they want me to use it."
"That's hard. That's that's not really an alluding thing to do, but yeah, it makes sense. And it's already in the guidelines, so you don't need to reinvent the"
"Okay. It's already known and it's already in the guidelines that someone who has a GOLD D criteria, you have an option to add an inhaled, to do a triple therapy. So it's really nothing new to me. I'm already practicing along those guidelines."
"I just tried to digest this data. So of course it's... I think... So it looks like if I'm interpreting it correctly, that the ICS LABA combination is actually better than the product X in terms of respiratory depths. I'm not sure if that one patient is going to be a significant change, but clearly the greatest impact is on cardiovascular mobility."
"Well, it looks like almost like the ICS LABA combination is better than the triple therapy, except maybe the known fatal MI, but all the rest, they're actually more patients experiencing cardiovascular events on product X than combination of ICS and LABA."
"No. For the non fatal MI, they are impaired and also the cardiovascular-"
"That they are impaired. That really, it doesn't prove it at all that product X would be superior compared to an ICS LABA combination."
"Now if I take just the cardiovascular causes, then patients probably are better off taking an ICS LABA combination than the others. And in terms of respiratory outcomes, just looking at the data they probably also better off being in a ICS LABA combination product X."
"Yes. Again, we just discussed that it's comparing it to the last effective of the two alternatives. We just discussed that the ICS LABA combination is at least impaired if not better than product X. So it's kind of highlighting the one that's more favorable to show that product X is better."
"If you are a credible, honest company, then you do a study that compares apples against apples and not against a different product. But I have a sense that the intention is not bad here. It's not up to me. They can paint as  inaudible 00:42:17  picture as they want to about that product, but it's still going to be fairly obvious to everyone that they are not comparing it against the generics."
"Yeah. And then again, to me they are knocking on an open door because... As I said, it's already in the guidelines and we all know that you have to add the inhaled steroids to the LABA Lama, in that COPD group."
That's fine with me. I have no objection. It's on the labeled and I would use it.
"You just showed me the data that it can, but it really applies to... It looks like it applies to all other drugs as well."
The difference between the ICS LABA and the product X is really not that great. And in some of the subsets ICS LABA looks even better than product X.
To me it's just way too complex. And then still they're adjusting it to what they want to say.
That the single inhaler therapy compares to a similar risk reduction and let's say putting patient on simvastatin or ACE inhibitor.
"So, putting patients on these products, it's showing the absolute relative risk reduction compared to some of the other studies using like statin or SGLT2 inhibitor."
"That I should be adding an inhaled corticosteroid to their LABA Lama, or I should be using an ICS LABA combination."
"No, on ICS. We just discussed, and I think slide six when the ICS LABA combination was even better than the triple agent."
"Because it just reviewed in slide six mortality percentages, the ICS LABA combination in many aspects is superior compared to-"
"Well, it just shows me the benefit of keeping these patients on the above described combination treatments in terms of decreased mortality from cardiovascular causes."
"The reason why not? Because I already base my treatments on the GOLD guidelines. So I look at that number of exacerbations and number of hospitalizations. And then I would start a patient in a given treatment without a second intention of do doing the cardiovascular mortality decrease. And unless the guidelines are changed and they're going to start GOLD category B patient on a triple therapy, just to decrease their cardiovascular mortality, because that's not in the GOLD guide... And if they are updating the guidelines in any way, then of course, because I'm bound by them. My practice, but it's nice to know. It's a nice added benefit, that I can tell that, okay by the way it's going to be a selling point for me that if you take one extra medication and inhale steroid it's not only going to be beneficial for your COPD. But we you have data, that's also decreasing cardiovascular poor outcomes, but I'm not starting a patient on a triple therapy with an intent to decrease their cardiovascular outcome, if otherwise it would not be stated by their severity of their COPD."
Well. Oh yeah. That initial I have to go by whatever my organization is putting out because there's the standard of care and if I don't do that then I'm might-
"Yeah. I am saying   00:49:08  of their COPD stage, with the intention of  inaudible 00:49:14  the cardiovascular outcome."
"I'm a cardiologist. I'm a clinical cardiologist. I've worked with a large... It used to be a private group in the Southeastern United States in a medium-sized city in the Southeastern United States. For the last five years, we have been part of a hospital system. There's been a lot of consolidation going on in medicine in the United States especially in cardiology in the last few years. So we are part of that process, so we work now with a hospital  inaudible 00:01:22  cardiology group that is functioning semi-independently within the hospital system. In other words, while we are part of the hospital system, we are called a wholly owned subsidiary. We are also a  Harvard 00:01:35  Institute that functions with its own management. So we function as a large single specialty cardiology group, and we see all sorts of patients, including patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction."
"Yes. I roughly work 50% of the time, the outpatient setting, and 50% of the time in the inpatient, I think cardiology has a lot of emergencies that deals with... So we need to provide continuous coverage for the hospital, but we follow our own patients. In other words, patients that we sometimes first meet in the hospital, we follow in the office, or vice versa. If one of our patients gets hospitalized, patients that we follow in the office and manage on a longitudinal basis, these patients, we also manage them in the hospital they call us. So we become their inpatient cardiologist."
"Well, probably... I haven't really done the exact math, but just thinking about my patient population, approximately 60%, maybe even two thirds of my patients with congestive heart failure have reduced eject fraction, approximately 40% of the patients have preserved the ejection fraction. So while they're minority, they're very substantial, minority."
"I put them into the category of patients with reduced ejection fraction, even if it's mild to model. So people usually vary in terms of how they define it. In my mind, the severely reduced would be less than 35%. Moderately reduced would be 35% to let's say 44% mild individuals would be patients with mild or minimally reduced dejection fraction, let's say 45% to 50%. And preserve dejection fraction would be patients with normal, or low normal ejection fraction."
"Roughly, half of them come to me as new patients in the outpatient setting. In other words, this would be somebody who has typically presented to their primary care physician with complaints of Dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, low extremity edema, exercise intolerance, this would be the typical symptoms that patients would present to it. They maybe have history of hypertension, they get an echocardiogram, they're noticed to have LVH or sometimes just normal, massive ventricle, but Diastolic dysfunction that can vary severity, echo evidence of their Diastolic dysfunction that can vary in severity. And sometimes a BMP is done, which is elevated, and the patients get referred to a cardiologist for that.   00:05:16  And they have other symptoms. Often they have other symptoms like chest pain or palpitations. And in the process of the workup they discover that they actually have Diastolic dysfunction, no significant  Avis 00:05:28 , but their symptoms in essence symptoms of congestive heart failure."
"With a preserved ejection fraction. With the patients with reduced level sugars, historic function is a little bit more easy and kind in your face diagnosis because they tend to present with a little bit more Somatic symptom. Their echocardiogram, and again, everybody gets an echo in our hospital when they come in if they have a heart, they get an echo basically. And the injection fraction is reduced to a variable degree, and so that's a diagnosis that's a little bit more straightforward."
"Well, certainly everybody that I see gets an echo very often before I've seen them in the hospital, but our hospital is any emergency or physicians have the local practices that if somebody has significant shortness of breath, they get echocardiogram very often, even the emergency room doctors who are not cardiologists and who are not trained echocardigrapher, they have portable sonographic machines, and they would sometimes when somebody comes to the emergency room with symptoms of shortness of breath, they will do informal bedside echo with their own machine and they're pretty experienced, so in other words, at least in the area where I practice access to echocardiography is very easy, and I don't know how it's in the UK, but in the United States, we tend to practice medicine that is kind of technology intensive, if you will. So echocardiogram, people get before I see them, by the time I see them, the echo has been ordered by the hospitalist, so they don't wait for a cardiologist or  inaudible 00:07:27 "
"Well, bedside echo is just a new form of echo. The technology has evolved to the point that they have inexpensive small portable machines, literally the size of a laptop with a transducer that the emergency room physicians, and especially the younger physicians, have learned that very often it helps them make quick diagnostic assessment, and diagnostic decisions to do an echo. They can certainly see a Pericardial effusion, they often use the same machine to do an abdominal sonogram, somebody comes with some other complaints or kidney ultrasound if somebody comes with fine pain for example. So it's not a formal procedure, in other words, they can't bill for it, they can charge for it, it is not something that gets into the patient's medical record, but they almost use it as high tech  descope 00:08:32  if you will."
"Probably HFpEF is a little bit above that. HFpEF is a little bit above that, but we all talking about congestive heart failure in general, and I've seen many patients who come with shortness of breath, and the emergency doctor tells me ""This is a brand new patient, his ejection fraction is severely reduced."" And I say, ""How do you know?"" No, I mean, he just came. And he said, ""I did a bedside echo."" And I said, ""Okay, good for you."""
"And I've seen them myself, especially the emergency room residents run around with these little laptops, and do sonograms on patients who just came. They don't want to wait for an echo. If you order an echo often gets done many hours later, and they have a machine in there, and they like playing with it. It's kind of on the border of their... How should I say? Job description, it's not really something that's part. And as I said, they can't write an official report, they cannot put it in their chart, they cannot bill for it, this is not a formal echo, formal echo, at least where I practice has to have certain elements, there are standards of the American society of Echocardiography what an echo can be in order to bill for it in order to put an official report. Often they require cardiologist, have reading privileges, the emergency doctor doesn't, but that doesn't prevent them to look."
It requires some competence just from experience.
"Well, it does urgency mostly depends on the patient's clinical presentation on how severe their symptoms. I would say that patient with preserved ejection fraction, they rarely present with such emergencies like acute pulmonary edema, that can happen, certainly happens, but it's less frequent than somebody with, let's say, acute myocarditis who comes with acute onset, severe congestive heart failure, Cardiogenic shock, or somebody with a large, massive myocardial infarction that leads to Acute mitral regurgitation, and acute pump failure with Cardiogenic shocks. So that doesn't tend to happen in patients with preserved ejection fraction, but their symptoms can be significant. And depending on how uncomfortable the patient is, they may need to be treated urgently, usually not as much."
"Well, it is congestive heart failure. It has similar even though not as dramatic prognosis as patients with reduced historic function and, congestive failure with reduced historic function, but it is in a way sometimes more resistant for treatment. Very often this is old age, or fibrosis, or some conditions that we cannot treat very effectively, like somebody with longstanding hypertension that has developed hypertrophy and distorting dysfunction patients with hypertrophy cardio may certainly have diastolic dysfunction, and heart failure with preserved ejection, sometimes super normal injection fraction. So it really depends on the theology of the condition, whether what the prognosis is? And how if effective treatment is? The typical breath and bad patient with diastolic dysfunction would be an elderly lady who has had hypertension for a while, that was treated but not very precisely, and over time, she has noticed that functional capacity has declined, even though she may be limited by other problems like orthopedic problems."
"She can't exercise much. So she can't really test the boundaries of her exercise capacity, but she starts noticing low extremity edema, she starts noticing getting winded with minimal exertion. And that's how she comes to us. And a typical patient like this very often would, does respond to diuretics, even though we try to use medications to modify the disease substrate, the Myocardial, Diastolic dysfunction, we don't have great medicines for that. We don't have great medicines for Systolic congestive heart failure, either, our medicines, they're mostly aimed at counteracting the pathology, the path physiology of the disease of the Neurohumoral activation. Diuretics are used for both category of patients with good symptomatic relief, but they don't change the underlying condition."
Yes. I think that's the one that I completed yesterday. I'm sorry. I don't have my chart in front of me. I'm at Homer right now.
"And I completed when I was in the hospital, but I was asked to provide, like typical patients, and I have seen patients like this, I see them every week, and I born to describe one male, and one female, typically what I see."
I'm sorry. I haven't written the age of the lady 72 years. I'm sorry. I missed that.
"This is a patient that I first met as an outpatient. She came to the office right after new year. She was referred to us by one of the primary care physicians that works within our hospital system. And she was somebody that has been seeing him for rheumatoid arthritis, and also has history of hypertension. So she noticed low extremity edema, and also about questioning reported fatigue that she was initially blaming on her age, but certainly had gotten much worse rather quickly within the last 12 months, mostly having the character of Dyspnea on exertion, but also sometimes just taking longer to recover after a routine physical activity, like cleaning around the house, or going to pick up the mail, or taking out the trash, or something like this. So they had noticed that she had Left ventricular hypertrophy on her EKG. The EKG was abnormal, had left ventricular hypertrophy with improvisation of normality, and sent her to us for workup."
"Yes. He had actually started her already in Lasix, and she had experienced some symptomatic improvement. Now we saw her just a few days later, actually think she had presented to him for a visit at the end of December, and he sent her, and we managed to see her pretty quickly. So he had started on Lasix and she had somewhat improved symptomatically, but she still complained that this non exertion the edema was certainly bad."
"Yes. In essence, she was diagnosed even though in this particular case, she had not had an echocardiogram. He had tried to order, sometimes when a primary care physician orders an echo done at our facility, it takes two or three weeks to schedule it, when a cardiologist orders, it usually gets done faster. I don't know if they have different scheduling pathways, but, I rarely wait for three weeks, and I hear from primary care physicians complaints that sometimes they wait for two, three weeks to get an echo done."
"I don't think that's the main thing, again, I think that I practice in an area where primary care physicians, I'm pretty sure that they have enough experience seeing patients with hypertension and with chronic congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction like her. So he appropriately suspected, I know that particular physician, he is very competent individual, but nevertheless, they tend to refer patients to cardiologists. There are very few barriers to a referral, thank God in our area. So that's why we have very large numbers of cardiologists. Years ago, I was at the conference where a very prominent, British cardiologist told us some numbers as to how many cardiologists are there, in the United Kingdom, and it was probably for the whole country was less than the area where I practice, that kind of stuff. Meaning, I know that the two healthcare systems are a little different, but our primary care physicians, there have no acts, no difficulty referring to a cardiologist, and they have no hesitancy referring to a cardiologist, anybody who have a heart condition."
"I don't know exactly but years, she has a rheumatoid arthritis, and she had history of hypertension that had been managed for quite a while by the primary care physician, very competently."
"Only that the symptoms built up gradually over the last one year, that in the beginning she was really reluctant. And there were many patients in the area where I live that were very reluctant to seek medical care for non-acute conditions, or what they perceived as, non emergencies because of the COVID pandemic, people were hesitant to go to healthcare facilities because they were concerned probably rightfully so that that was a high risk exposure to other patients, and to healthcare personnel, so many people deferred care. So this lady to answer, I'm sorry, I'm giving you such long winded answers, but this lady had reported that she had had symptoms for a few months, or at least before that, but it very slowly, gradually got worse."
"Well, we've seen sometimes that phenomenon before the pandemic, but totally today the pandemic is high on people's minds, and many things get explained away with the pandemic. Sometimes patients just take a while to go seek medical care today, they have a perfect excuse."
"Yes. Well, the fatigue, as well as the dyspnea on exertion sometimes need to be teased out, patients with the rheumatoid arthritis, we sometimes concern about the possibility of mixed connective tissue disease of the possibility of pulmonary hypertension, of the possibility of just deconditioning somebody who has a lot of orthopedic problems, sometimes, and especially with this age group that was mostly urged to stay isolated over the last couple of years because of the pandemic. When people move out and start exerting themselves, sometimes just a question of the conditioning. So that's why we are looking for some objective evidence of the fact that congestive heart failure is responsible. So like she, for example, we tested the BMP, and it was modestly elevated, it was 220, and in our lab, the upper limit of normal is 100 for actually 95, I think for BMP. So BMP was elevated, she had moderate LVH on her echocardiogram, and she had evidence of mild moderate diastolic dysfunction on her echocardiogram as well. So this together with the clinical presentation, and her response to diuretic made me think she had congestive with preserved dejection fractions."
"Well, no. Sometimes they kind of have to do workup themselves if it takes a while to see a cardiologist, but our group in particular has had a focus over the last one year to provide availability for our referring physicians so that we are trying very hard to see patients within a week of referral. So that changes their practice because for them it's a refer of change the box I'm done, let's see what the cardiologist recommends, that kind of attitude."
I actually ordered it. Yeah. I ordered it. Yes.
"This particular patient had had a set of routine biochemistry labs, she had what we call BMP or this is like there is array of chemical tests, like sodium level, chloride level, potassium,  creat 00:23:56  and BON. So they had ordered that, she had one from the end of December when he had seen her, so they had ordered that but he had not ordered the BNP."
"It is. They're familiar with that. We're familiar with that. We actually have an outreach program where we give them talks and try to strengthen the relationship mostly so that they see our faces, they refer to us. It's kind of a marketing strategy if you will, but it's also educational strategy. So we've spoken many times with primary care physicians about the use of some of the biochemical markers for different cardiac conditions, including DNP for CHF, and they ordered it, they cannot order it in this particular case, it wasn't, but I've seen it many other cases where it was."
"Frankly? I was impressed by her EKG. What I was thinking was that, looks like it had been a longstanding condition, I felt, I didn't find any EKGs from a few years ago to compare, but she had classical EKG of somebody with Left ventricular hypertrophy, and that was confirmed by the echocardiogram. I'm also concerned about some other conditions that have become more of a focus of cardiologists and primary care physicians like cardio coming more doses, sometimes an issue, especially somebody with connective tissue disease, like rheumatoid arthritis, I'm concerned about pulmonary hypertension, but you didn't have that much of RDH, and yeah, we clearly show that the pulmonary historic pressures were high normal, if you will. I think pulmonary historic pressure was like 35 milliliters of mercury."
"No. She was prescribed the diuretic and she was told that she had at low extremity swelling that can come from a variety of different conditions. They're going to check a set of laps to make sure that she doesn't have kidney disease, again, significant reason to suspecting somebody who has longstanding hypertension and connective tissue disease, but they felt that they can give her something to relieve her symptoms and to deal with edema. So they have prescribed Lasix in the small dose, just 20 milligrams a day, and she had taken it for about the week or 10 days before she saw me after it was prescribed. And when I saw her, she had just traced low extremity, even she said that it was worse before that, and her symptoms had some somewhat improved, but she continued to have some dyspnea on exertion."
"Yes. I discussed with her and I told her, We spoke with her in office. I gave her a call after the echocardiogram was done because that kind of solidified my clinical diagnosis after the echocardiogram was done a few days later. And I told her that looks like her heart is, I don't know if I use the right words, but I said, it's getting a little old, we usually worried about weakness of the heart, and you have good strength of your heart, but it's getting a little stiffer. And that's probably because of your longstanding high blood pressure."
"The blood pressure actually, when she came to see me in the office was not that well controlled, it was looking, I believe it was in the 150s for the systolic and around 90 diastolic. So that prompted me to change her, she had been on bisoprolol for hypertension, and she was only taking two and a half milligrams because she had complained of fatigue. So I changed it to Coreg, and I gave her 12.5 twice a day mostly course Coreg is a good blood pressure medicine, much better than the bisoprolol, and I added the  inaudible 00:28:53 ."
"Well, I think that again, where practice, most patients have already access to cardiologist, and I think that the majority of the diagnosis, at least, how should I say? Confirmed and made official after they see a cardiologist they're suspected, they're sometimes told to the patient by the primary care physician, if he, or she's the one who sees them first, but the word congestive heart failure, the word heart failure, start by a few people. They never thought of themselves as somebody with significant heart disease. This lady, her real focus until now healthcare focus was on her rheumatoid arthritis, everything for her was the rheumatoid arthritis. She had been on aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis for a while."
"She had been seeing a rheumatologist for a while. That's where her healthcare focus was. So somebody like this being told, or you have congestive heart failure, you have heart failure, all of a sudden they say, ""Gee, you that's a very serious, potentially lethal condition."" So we need to explain to them that it's a manageable condition, this is something that many patients live with, and we can treat it both symptomatically and sometimes improve the root causes, which in her case, I think was the hypertension that was not very well controlled for a while, and that patients can improve and that many patients have reasonable life expectancy with that condition."
"I try to mellow it down a little bit. I start talking to them about, the heart is a little stiffer, you're not an old woman, but you're not as young as you were 50 years ago, things change with time and things like this, these are the words that I often use, just to, if it will soften the blow, because again, heart failure in the minds of many lay people is something that quickly leads to death, and that's just not true for this patient."
"I have seen situations of PCP diagnosing HFpEF patients. Many of them are very, very experienced. Many of them, until a few years ago were coming to see their own patients in the hospital. So they have experienced both on the outpatient and the inpatient site. That has changed over the years in the area where I practice, where most of the primary care physician, just in the office just economically doesn't make sense for them to keep coming to the hospital. And in the hospital, we have internal medicine, hospitalists who manage the patients. So it has changed, but many of them are all timers who have experiencing patients like this in the hospital, who have seen more acutely all patients in their practice. And in this particular case, I'm very well know the physician, he's a very experienced and very capable person."
"They still refer. We have a kind of a different medical legal system where, any patient, even the most appropriately treated patient may have a bad outcome, and in the United States, at least in the area where I practice, they start picking, if you have ever a bad outcome, and the first question is how dare you not referring to a cardiologist? So they have no hesitancy referring patients."
"Well, because I felt that this is a patient where there was a clear case, she had the LVH, she had diastolic dysfunction, she had sign and symptoms of congestive heart failure. So I think that this was a reasonable diagnosis to make an assessment that she has, and she had preserved ejection fraction, so she had heart failure. She had preserved ejection fraction, the diagnosis is quite descriptive, that actually says that, heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction."
"So she fits that definition, and she had responded well to Lasix. So I thought Lasix was a good idea to continue. Her blood pressure was not very well controlled, and I personally felt that she was on a beta block, that was not a very good blood pressure medication Coreg is certainly more important. And I gave her Lisinopril because Lisinopril is one of the antagonists of the RA system, and it is helpful both for treatment of hypertension, but also can have other side effects on the kidney function, on at least preserving the kidney function lockdown. And it can help, we believe, maybe diversity model the hypertrophy heart."
"Boy. Very often, unfortunately the discussion is ""Here's the pill, please take it."" ""Tell me how you feel?"""
"If they ask about adverse reactions, I would tell them in this particular situations that these pills that have been around for decades, they're pretty safe. Any medicine can have adverse reactions, but these in particular like Lasix has been around since the 60s I believe, Coreg came out in the 90s, lisinopril has been around since probably late 80s, early 90s. So these are medicines that doctors have had very extensive experience, they don't cause long term side effects. Occasional patient allergic to them, both to  sofonomites 00:37:13 , which is Lasix and also patients that sometimes they're allergic to Lisinopril, to ACE inhibitor, but this patient did not have any such allergies, so I just get into it, say, ""See how we feel, come back to see in two months."""
"No, it's not a conscious thing, but I have 15 minutes, so just the time just there are limitations in terms of how much we can discuss, you know I have to examine her, have to review her records, I have to prescribe, I have to give her some basic explanations. There is just like, not a unlimited time for discussions."
"If you ask the questions I would responded, but the discussion, if you want to get into all details would be hours long."
"I actually studied it. I actually studied right away because for me, what struck me was that the blood pressure was not well controlled both when she came in the office, and she also told me that she has a blood pressure cuff at home, and very often the systolic is in the 130 to 150 range. And it had been like this for a while, so this was something where, probably the fact that she did not see her primary care physician for a long time due to the pandemic was something that was neglected for a period of time."
"So I felt that this was what was the main reason, so I started care, and I was pretty convinced that she had signs the symptoms of congestive heart failure."
"Well, that's what's... I don't know how they say it, where I lived, they say that if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck. So it looked like congestive heart failure, she had signs and symptoms, it was a very typical presentation, and she had already improved with Lasix. So I said, ""Okay, well, Lasix's fine, but your blood pressure's still a little high, maybe we can try this to see if it works better. And again, both the BNP and the echocardiogram confirmed my suspicion. A typical leakage you showing AOVH is clearly diagnostic of LVH, and hers was very, very typical, she has, both the high amplitude and the  reprosation 00:40:05  of normality that goes with Left ventricular hypertrophy."
Meaning how much time did they spend with her during the initial visit?
"Well, I first saw her just the beginning of this month. This was a very recent new patient, this was a very recent new patient, I saw her the week of the new year, and I started treatment when I saw her in the office for the initial consultation, and then I've had one phone call with her, and she's supposed to come and see me at the end of February. So I have seen her only once."
"And I spoke with her again a week later when I read the echocardiogram, I gave her a call."
"It is fairly typical. Meaning, if the diagnosis is fairly clear, I can start some treatment right away, sometimes equally probable outcome would be, I suspect that's what it is, but I would wait for the echocardiogram to confirm it. And then I would call her after an echocardiogram. In some patients, we do stress nuclear tests to make sure they don't have ischemia. This patient will likely get it, but hasn't been done yet just because of her age and her risk factors, and the fact that she has shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, so she has exercise induced symptoms, which can be CHA, but it could be an  inaudible 00:41:58  equivalent."
"So she has a... This is a modality that we use a lot here, a stress nuclear test and stress nuclear test usually is a pharmacological stress nuclear test that is coming to be done. That takes a little longer to do in many patients. So it hasn't been done yet, but I think it's scheduled somewhere in the middle of February and it'll be available by the time I see her for follow up at the end of this month."
Seeing a patient then seeing them again a month or two or three months later is the typical timeframe.
"Well, that particular test is a test for Myocardial ischemia. In other words, the most common condition in cardiology is through coronary disease, or blockages in the others of the heart, and patients who are postmenopausal female with hypertension, with connective tissue disease, with... I don't think she has dyslipidemia, she was not on treatment and she's not a smoker, but certainly age, postmenopausal state and history of hypertension, a risk for a Coronary disease. So we would often do some non-invasive testing, either a stress echo or more commonly in the area where I practice a stress nuclear tests. Nuclear test is like a Myocardial proficient study is."
"Well, There is a variety of treatment modalities, but I would like to tailor them to the severity of the patient's symptoms, in her case, I thought the pathophysiology of her HFpEF was mostly because of hypertension that wasn't well controlled. So I felt that Lisinopril and Coreg would be optimal."
Something that would be specifically for HFpEF doesn't cross my mind.
"Entresto is a very good medicine, Entresto is a very good medicine and Entresto potentially can be used for patients. We tend to use it in patients who are more symptomatic, who have more severe, if you will and who don't respond to less expensive, and more convention, I don't want to call Entresto unconventional, but certainly is a newer treatment that at least for a while, where our practice was not very easy to get approved because it's a lot more expensive. So very often we have to justify why would we prescribe Entresto? And there are many patients with advanced systolic heart failure who get Entresto, not that many with diastolic congestive heart failure who get Entresto, but certainly can be used."
"Well, I would actually use any patients who fail to respond to more conventional treatment, if they don't respond to a combination of beta block. And I like Coreg for HFpEF because Coreg is a potent anti hypertensive, unlike other beta blockers, I can use other beta blockers, but Coreg is no longer under patent in the United States, in other words, it's available is generic  inaudible 00:45:55  and it's not very expensive. And it's a combination beta in alpha blocker, and it's a good anti hypertensive medication."
"Well, Many of these patients are not... Hypertension is rare a problem in patients with HFpEF, the way it is for patients with reduced ejection fraction, many patients with reduced ejection fraction, they're in borderline blood pressure. So Entresto is sometimes an issue there, renal function can be a problem, but Cost is a barrier. That's about it. It's usually hypertension and renal function and cost. These are the things and just a psychological barrier, maybe that we tend to think of interest a little bit more often in patients with poorly controlled systolic congestive heart failure."
"Yes. And it really depends on how she responds to treatment. Usually, when we see a patient, we... I wouldn't say never, but rarely tell them, ""You don't need me anymore."" I would not make them come see me very often. I am hoping to get to a position where I can see her once a year because, and most of the other visits are with the primary care physician because I also have limited capacity and I need to keep availability for new patients that they refer to us that, if we work with a certain group of referring physicians, we need to not only manage patients that they have sent us, but also keep availability, so if there is a new patient, we remain available for them, otherwise they'll start sending them elsewhere. So I am trying not to see patients if they don't need to be seen, but I would still like to maintain a relationship with her because that's what patients want to."
"But also that's what allows me to see how my treatments are working. That's how I get better, that's how I don't miss things. And it's funny, sometimes I don't see a patient for a few years, and when they come back, it takes a lot of time just to figure out what's happening in the meantime, very often when they come back, they come back, but they had something major done at another institution or by another doctor, let's say they had cancer, they lost half of their lung, or they were diagnosed with some serious hematological condition, and still giving them the same medicines, maybe their kidney deteriorated, they need to adjust medications, so patients need to be seen periodically as a surveillance if you will."
"So I usually try to bring it down to once a year for patients who are stable, but somebody like this, I will likely see at two months, then if she's responding well to medicine, I will seek her three, four months down the road, I will probably see her at some point in six months, and if everything is fine and we've reached a stable therapeutic regimen, I would say, ""Please come back once a year."" Once a year, I may repeat an echocardiogram, I'll certainly repeat an echocardiogram next year in January for her because sometimes we see modeling, we see a decrease in the LVH, at least we want to see no further progression of the structural changes in the heart."
"And that's provided her stress test is negative. If the stress test is positive, she may end up getting more stuff."
"I can check a BMP. I would probably check a BMP at the next visit because she's already on diuretic, but she would have been on diuretic instead for a week, she would've been for two months, I started some new treatment. I'm hoping to see a decrease in the BMP. So that's one of my objective pieces of evidence as to what's going on with patient."
"How she respond for treatment, and echo again, echo because it's looking at the structure of the account that doesn't change that quickly, I probably would wait for a year before I order a repeat echo, but I will definitely get one next year. Yeah."
"Annual appointment? Yes. That's kind of the lowest frequency that I'm used to, annual appointments is for patients who are doing well. I tell them, ""If you're doing fantastic, I still want to do see you at one year."" ""If you have any problems, call me, I'll see you before that."""
"I probably won't be doing it every year. I'll definitely do the first one at one year, but then if it shows a little bit of improvement or it is the same, I'll probably check it again. If there is no change in patients symptoms in patients condition, if she continues to do the well, I'll probably do another one in two years and then maybe in five years. But again, it's difficult to plan what to do eight years down the road. I don't look that far."
"For me, the biggest need is, I would love to have something that would be able to reverse remodel the heart. So we think that HFpEF is because of decreased compliance, or increase stiffness of the heart. And there certain conditions that lead to that, and there are certain specific conditions like Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy doses, which starts as diastolic. So I would like to have specific treatment for that. I wish there was a way to change the genetic signals, the gene signals that are sent to that myocardium so that it a reverse models itself that the hypertrophy gets back to normal that the stiffness indicated."
"In other words, I would like to have a pathophysiological treatment of the specific processes that trigger that, and that's what we lacking. We have treatments that counteract the pathophysiological responses of the whole body, the activation of the angiotensin system, the retention of fluid, the buildup of pressure in the lung that makes the lungs stiffer, and makes the patient more short of breath and gives them symptoms. So we have a good symptomatic treatments, but we don't have that good pathophysiological treatments if you will."
"No, thank you very much. It was interesting discussion. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to express my opinions."
"Sure, so I'm at a hospital that, pretty big center, is a tertiary care center, level three, level four referral center, large referral system. It's a clinical care program with a fellowship training program. I'm a clinical, predominantly cardiologist, work with a lot of fellows, write a lot, publish a lot, work with our pulmonary hypertension team, a tremendous amount of help, hire a lot of people published in that field. Take care of who class 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and I've been here about 20 years and have decent amount of grants and research publications. See a lot of clinical patients as an inpatients, and..."
"I'd say somewhere in the neighborhood, about 300 patients or so, a month."
"Gosh, as we're a tertiary care center, I imagine it's a better part of about 75 or 80% of these people have other comorbidities."
"Diabetes, hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, asthma, obesity. Those are the probably top five."
"Yeah, so there's two roles I would manage. So as a cardiologist, we're going to be watching those patients very carefully. I follow their HbA1c if necessary. I work in conjunction with endocrinology, but the path that I'll do is I'll be tracking their, recognizing as with heart disease, that diabetes adds another complexity for both macro and microvascular disease. So, while I may not be actually treating those patients in the first group of patients, I will be asking them questions about their legs, their feet, their eyes, making sure that they're following up with their endocrinologists, tracking their HbA1c."
"But there's another group of patients, in fact, that I'll make the diagnosis of diabetes first. And I will simultaneously refer them to a diabetologist, a nutritionist, ophthalmologist, a podiatrist, but I'll start therapies right then and there. I used to not do that, but I find that as a cardiologist, I'm a bit more aggressive than some of our endocrinologists are."
"And so many times we'll see that they're not on something, or if they're on something it's not controlling them and they have established cardiovascular disease. And this is where, say an SGLT2, like Forxiga, one of those ages may be advantageous for a pure cardiovascular benefit beyond even the diabetic. And I'll initiate that. It used to be, I'd say, ""Hey, listen, why don't you consider doing this?"" But I'm pretty, reasonably aggressive. I know it's not quite, my nurse gets upset at me, sometimes she says. ""That's not in your lane."" But it is in my lane. There are complications will cause cardiac problems."
"I think to some certain extent because the kidneys are in parallel, almost a slave to the heart and vice versa, that we're very cognizant of the cardiac implications of medicines on the kidneys. So, we work closely with our nephrologist and recognize that some of the limitations of taking care of patients are in fact, the ability to up titrate medicines, because they have such a profound either intraparenchymal, non parenchymal effect on their renal function, that oftentimes we are stymied by our abilities to take care of the heart because of the kidneys just scream at us."
"So we work closely with our nephrologist and many patients, maybe not as close as we should, but early on we'll start medicines and try to work imperviously through their kidneys, but the kidneys have the last laugh. So we'll ask the neurologist to get involved in those early."
"Yeah. So, as a tertiary care cardiologist, many times they've already come to me with their shortness of breath, having been reasonably well evaluated and that the..."
"Yeah, so that's where I was going. So it'd be evaluated by their PCP, their internist, hospitalist. And so they came in with shortness of breath and they have done some preliminary workup, so I know that the domain is mine, that it's their heart. Do I say that I don't get patients that just come with shortness of breath and they've been sent to me for evaluation? I do, but that's the minority, but let's say just for your, unless you tell me otherwise, a patient comes in with shortness breath. So I know that the two predominant things that are going to be causing the shortness of breath are the heart and the lungs."
"So EKG, listening in on their examination are going to be the key things that come their way. I've got some biologic tests that I can do, but generally they're their patient, and I'm seeing them in clinic. I'm not going to have it access to a BNP that would nicely sift through, but their physical examination will tell me whether there's  inaudible 00:08:26 , there's wheezing, whether there's edema, whether they're using accessory muscles, a barrel chest, whether they're pink, puffer, or blue bloater, that kind of   00:08:35 "
"The example that I'm giving you, which is the minority, I'm just saying that a patient comes to me as an unknown, that I don't know anything about them."
"But yeah, if the majority of the patients will have, if they come to me, they'll already have had some workup. The pulmonologist says, ""Hey, man, it's not, it's not my territory, it's yours."" But there's cases where we work together."
"And there's, it's complicated, there's cardiopulmonary, there's shunting, there's AV valve malformations and hypoxia, et cetera. But, the first thing I'm thinking of is, are you a smoker? Do you have asthma? Do you have, so I'll quickly rule in or rule out those kind of things. And then, if I hear those kind of concerns, then we're going to get some blood tests. We're going to get PFT as the first, second, and third thing that I'm going to be looking for in those patients, and echocardiogram. If I'm not hearing anything, it would suggest this is pulmonary is a reasonable thing, but physical examination history are the big two things that I'm going to be doing."
"Yeah. So again, that kind of depends, Mindy, on how you send that patient to me. If they're coming as an unknown..."
"Well, I'm assuming since they came to see me that somebody's asked me to do at least the early stages of the workup, which often will entail somebody who's, some involvement of pulmonary workup. I'll get a history of 40-pack year smoking and I hear wheezing and they're using accessory muscle and they're coughing, and they have COPD exacerbation hospitalizations. My cardiac workup is going to be somewhat limited. So I'll send them for PFT, just as a courtesy to the pulmonologist. And then the pulmonologist will have a little bit of a leg up when they're seen, and some of this workup's already been done."
"But if you're asking me, would I start Trilogy on somebody? Would I start  inaudible 00:11:05 ..."
"Yeah. I have to, especially if I know that there's an underlying... I've got plenty of patients like that. There's an underlying pulmonary process that I can't fix. I've got a obese lady that I'm going to see in clinic today without giving you HIPAA details, that had LV dysfunctions, had heart attacks, has a bit of a cardiomyopathy, and she's been a 50-60 year pack smoker."
"She's on oxygen now. I co-manage her with a pulmonologist, so I'm pretty busy in trying to solve the pulmonary problems. And the pulmonologist is trying to solve his problems, and not sure which one, at the end of the day is the worst. I think it's the lung problem. He thinks it's probably the cardiac, but we each still real comfortable on our own domain. And we can only do so much, so we work together, but yeah, this happens a lot."
So if I have somebody that has COPD and cardiac?
"Yeah. So, well, I'm not sure how I answer that any differently. If I think they have COPD, and I've reached the point where, I think that's part of it that I would send those patients for PFTs, or the PFT looked abnormal, or substantially abnormal, then I'd ask for my pulmonologist to help out, help bring in, I'm an okay pulmonologist, but they're far better."
"And so I think that staying in my lane is, I'll stay in the lane for a little while, but then I'll, I know those guys are better adept, suited to do that. So, if you're asking, I have no compunction about asking for help from something that's outside my expertise and likewise, they as well. They don't want to mess with the heart and not saying that's right or wrong, but it certainly is a much of an academic  inaudible 00:13:51 , probably better, that's it."
"Yeah. So, you might not be surprised to know that I would say that the great majority of my patients have non-cardiac respiratory issues, maybe not the great majority. I would say that fully 50% of them at one point other have smoked, I would say that about 10% of them carry a diagnosis of COPD. Fifteen percent of them like that probably have some aspect where they have an inhaler that they carry around with them. Maybe 15 is a high number, but, probably 10% to 15%. So, it's not a trivial group of patients that have that as an issue."
"Yeah, so unlike the kidneys where virtually everything I do is going to have some effect on the kidneys. In fact, very little of that has a particularly effect on the heart. It may be a little bit of a beta effect, but a majority of the corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase, et cetera, steroids, et cetera, combination inhalers are, relatively speaking, inert. Some of them will drive heart rate and make you a little bit more tachycardic, but usually those aren't going to put someone in a, the risk benefit ratio is fine from oral steroids, et cetera. I don't use theophylline much anymore. Using oxygen is going to be helpful for these patients."
"Maybe I'll be pushing pulmonary rehab more than I will cardiac rehab. Recognizing this is a big thing. I talk to everybody about quitting smoking. Obviously, somebody who's got evidence on their CT scan or their x-ray, or their FEV1's, that they've got COPD, I'm going to beat them up even harder about their, putting them Chantix or something that getting them off their smoking, which is a whole other conversation, but a very difficult one."
"Well, it depends what you're asking. I'm comfortable in pretty clearly making that diagnosis. I don't need anybody too sophisticated to make that diagnosis. But I think that from choice of medications and based on their FEV1, what they're going to be better off with, X or Y or Z, and just the general routine maintenance for those patients. I think that these are in the domain of the pulmonologist. So, I'm comfortable enough to know when to refer those patients and I'm not shy about doing such."
"Huh, that's a nice question. So generally, no, because there's seeing me for their aspect of their cardiovascular disease, but this one patient that I'm referring to, I really do believe that her issues, she's not any cardiac issues with me and say two or three years, they're all lung, they're all issues, cardiac patients don't walk around with oxygen generally, or portable oxygen. They don't wheeze like that. And they don't have FEV1's at 0.5."
"So, this is, and they don't have smoking 60-70 pack per years. So there are patients in which yes, the pulmonary do take precedence. I think most of the time those patients are seen as pulmonologist as their primary, not primary doctor, but that's their primary issue. And then the cardiology is seen as a, hey also, by the way, you've got cardiac stuff. I'm not sure that makes sense, but whereas, mostly I see most of the cardiac stuff and then refer to the pulmonologist."
There's a few of those patients that the pulmonologists really are the ones who are driving the show and the cardiac issues are subordinate or secondary.
"Yeah, I'm very concerned about it for a lot of reasons. You want me to go in and sometimes it's very difficult to distinguish between a heart failure exacerbation and a COPD exacerbation, and certainly to the patient they may have even less ability. So, these are big deals, so, and one may trigger the other and vice versa. So..."
"That's just it, that those are big things and you come to the emergency room and it may not be the easiest thing to sort out. I think, BNP's have gone a long way towards gently, gradually more redirecting more fastidious vasal care to those patients. And an echocardiogram cetera sometimes has been shown to the  inaudible 00:19:31  have been pretty helpful in distinguishing early on in the emergency room. But yeah, it's a big deal. My nurse and I may have a hard time trying to figure out on a Saturday night, whether Mrs Smith's having a COPD exacerbation or a heart failure exacerbation."
"Well again, it depends on the patient you're giving me. If I'm, this other lady who's, weighs 300 pounds, comes in. I'm probably a little bit more concerned about that. Most of my patients that come in with shortness of breath are established heart patients, and I'm more concerned about their heart failure exacerbation than I am to COPD. But, I know there's an overlap there. But I said, most of my patients are, that's 10, 15% of my patients. That's a big issue."
"Probably in aggregate, no. Again, because the therapies for these things are generally somewhat distant to cardiovascular complications or interactions. I'm not saying we're naive to that, but really there the cardiac aspects, again, relative to say, the kidneys, are somewhat removed from that. So it's somewhat in with impunity, the pulmonologist going to work on that."
"I recognize that steroids are going to affect the diabetes and diabetes will affect the heart, but not a big deal. I'm going to vaccinate all these patients. I'm going to ask all of them to quit smoking. I'll ask them to see a psychologist. ""I can't really stop smoking."" I'll send them to either cardiac or pulmonary rehab based on that. So I think it's fortuitous that the treatments seem to be somewhat distant from, overlap from the heart."
"So I think that at a high view, the patient has a hard time, as I said, distinguishing between the heart failure exacerbation and a COPD exacerbation, they may get smart over time, and recognize in that wheezing is more likely to be cardiac. Although, cardiac asthma is not an unknown phenomena, but, so treating both is an important aspect of it. But I think more important is, understanding at the base level is, what the diagnosis is. And once you make that diagnosis, A, how competent are you and B, what tools do you have to treat one without affecting the other."
"And I said earlier, I think that part is actually the easy part. It's making that diagnosis that's the tough part. But I think the inter-relatability, the overlap, the interaction is quite pleasingly distinct enough that I don't think the pulmonologist causes me harm. I don't think I cause him or her harm."
"Yeah, so that's an interesting thought. So I think that if you are able, that's a big word, able to control pulmonary disease, then when there are heart issues such as heart failure that creep in, there's a higher bar that has to be accomplished before you, your lung waters from the heart failure, start getting into your alveolar space that, and so I, treating good heart failure will probably give the pulmonologist and the patient a little bit more of a threshold or a little bit more safety net that they're not going to get that subjective sense of dyspnea, which is coming from two different mechanisms. So it's a very good point. Treating one will allow you a little bit more latitude."
"So I don't think that's going to improve their COPD no, but the point I'm trying to get at is that if you can improve their heart failure symptoms by 25%, then you maybe have more of a safety net is the word I'm to use. So that the COPD can get a little out of control, and they're not going to be pushing up against lung water because they've got a loss of alveolar function."
"So I think there is a role for recognizing in those patients that have both those morbidity slash comorbidities, to treat one and that'll have beneficial effects than the other. But if you're asking me if I choose drug A, will that benefit the patient somewhere else, then I'm going to say, treating drug A does not help them."
Sorry. I missed that. Hang on one second.
"Yeah. I know Bob. Like I said, I had 11 o'clock is when I can do it. I just need to make sure that the PowerPoint, that's all I needed from you is the PowerPoint to make sure it works."
"I'm sorry. Somebody walked in. I said, don't interrupt me before 11 o'clock and interrupt the interview."
Not so much other than that point I just made.
"Not so much other than the exact opposite. So just be clear, you take care of one, you will help the other, but not directly. That's the point I want to make sure you get clearly."
"No. I mean, yeah, sure. A beta blocker might not be the best thing for a COPD person, but, these are, so we choose agent. We try not to use a beta blocker if you want to go down that pathway in those patients. But, they recognize that if they put a beta agonist there, that's probably not the best thing for a heart patient, but, with those exceptions, those are pretty much kindergarten kind of decisions to make. That's not too difficult."
"Yeah. The set that seems a little higher than I would've thought, but I think If you're asking for my comment, I would agree that the majority of COPD patients have that comorbidity of cardiovascular and vice versa, but it's not surprising. Cancer makes sense, not from a cardiac standpoint, but probably from all the carcinogenic effects of what driving, probably 99% of COPD patients, unless it's somebody with alpha one antitrypsin disorders like that."
"Probably actually surprised that maybe the CV causes are only 39%, because I think that if you believe that people, I have a sense that if you're a smoker, you probably also have other things that are disadvantageous to your lifestyle. So you probably are not athletic. You probably don't care what you eat. You probably are more likely to be overweight and sedentary. So, you are setting yourself up for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from atherosclerosis, from your couch potato behavior, et cetera. So, you just don't see a guy who's, you know, doing 200 mile bike races on a weekend, smoking. Right?"
"The smokers I see are rarely healthy people. They just aren't. So I'm not at all surprised. And so their risk for cancer and cardiac stuff is high, because you can see in  inaudible 00:29:55  that most of these people are having pulmonary stuff. I'm actually surprised that pulmonary is not higher than there, but yeah, this doesn't surprise me so much, but I have not ever thought of it."
"Probably if you're asking me, I would say that COPD, now it's real clear that you have identified a population, a subpopulation of a large amount of the society that still smoke. That in addition to worrying them about their dying of lung cancer, that they're likely at extraordinarily high risk, maybe now it's a word that you can use to them. ""Hey listen, four studies have said that upwards of 39% of patients in the smallest trial, but the average year is probably, you know, 25-30% of these patients are, one out of four, you're going to die of cardiovascular disease. So, another reason why you should stop smoking."""
"I'm not sure this is actually saying you should treat COPD better, because I don't think that's what this is saying. It's just saying the association of all comers with COPD, presumably regardless of their treatment. We don't know that, but this slide doesn't say that it suggests that we should treat COPD better, but that would be the intonation of this slide."
"So yeah, so these two times the risk of cardiovascular disease knows about COPD. Yeah. And here, I'm again, surprised that it's only two times, frankly. I just find that COPD is, assuming this is from I think we're going to say that obstructive pulmonary disease, the lion's share, 99% of these patients are due to smoking. And so the smoking is a driver of cardiovascular disease on its own. So, this is somewhat shocking, not, maybe shocking is a big word, but it's not surprising that it's two times, I think it'd be higher, causing ischemic heart disease, heart failure, et cetera, especially ischemic heart disease and ischemic heart disease generates ischemic cardiomyopathies and those trigger heart failure symptoms."
"Well here, you're seeing that these patients have, here, they're saying on average of about a minimum, about 30%, so one in three patients are going to have risk of, if you add cardiovascular disease, let's see. Versus, slide's kind of funny here, be it versus CV alone. Yeah. So, the additive impact of having COPD driving ischemic heart disease, or just the occurrence of both of them. No, probably not anything more surprising than that. I'm sure I could dig into that some more, but heart failure symptoms, I'm surprised if you have ischemic heart disease, that you don't have more heart failure than that, but that seems reasonable."
That's derived from those four studies. I take it?
"Yeah. Now this is, how do I say this? This is not surprising. This reflects my recollection experience and overall attitudes here that when you get sick, that the opportunity for you to get sicker in the hospital or out the hospital is, in fact increased. We, outpatient situation, a little different, but yeah, the risk of MI depends on what definition of MI you're using."
"But this is not an unusual experience that somebody comes in with COPD exacerbation, and they burn some troponins, or they have a heart attack, or they start getting ischemic events, or a routine echo shows a new wall motion abnormality. I was surprised it's four times as much in that first bar graph, but that's really, it's almost exactly four times as much. So if you can get them through the hospital that first five days, you're back to nearly normal. That's..."
"Yeah. So, stroke, I'm, a little to tougher to see that, but I'm not sure exactly I can pick up the mechanism for that. I can derive that there's some potentiation of thrombotic state or hyper thrombotic state from the COPD or maybe the medicines that they're being given. But yeah, that's the part that's a little bit shocking, and that in fact, doesn't reflect my clinical sense of what's happening."
"I'm just not seeing COPD exacerbations lead to strokes. Now, you understand that you have me at a somewhat of disadvantage. I'm seeing the patients in red here. I'm not seeing the patients in blue. So this may be a well known thing if you asked a pulmonologist."
"Yeah. Not so much in the red bar, but yeah. On the green or blue or whatever bar that is, yeah. It's another thing to stack into my sensorium that when I talk to a patient, you've got four trials with about 10,000, 12,000 patients, at an average of a maximum of about 39% increase in cardiovascular complications, more mortality, the average of about 25. But in fact, your risk of an MI doubles with each one of those and your risk for stroke has gone up by nearly half as much. So these are all   00:37:10 ."
"Yeah. So, depends how you define moderate. I imagine the moderate exacerbation..."
"I don't even know whether moderate is, I think that even a mild exacerbation, most people are getting a burst of pulse steroids, or they're on a little bit of steroids. So that could be, even to me, that's a generous example of what moderate really means. Because this isn't, this seems to me a mild exacerbation, you're going to get thrown on Zithromax and you're going to be given a 10 day, you're going to get Z-Pak and you're going to get 10 days of, pulse steroids here. You're not, not IV, but, so maybe it's even worse that this is mild and moderate. Imagine if you really have a moderate where you're hospitalized or you have severe, where you were put on, you're intubated, is my thought."
"Well, I think that it's pretty straightforward. I think that we need to be cognizant that a COPD exacerbation isn't just affecting the lungs. It has a myriad of other organ involvement and likely it has effect more than just the brain and the heart. I suspect that you start looking at pancreas or diabetic stuff. You put a patient on steroids and he's moderate diabetic, we know what that does, probably affects pancreas function. It probably affects GI function. Those are the things that aren't going to necessarily get us admitted a hospital like MI and stroke will be."
Okay. ICS. I don't know that phrase. What's that?
"What is ICS? Oh, inhale corticosteroid, okay."
"Yeah, so here's something like Trilogy or when the combination of these things. Wow. So, that's impressive. So putting patient on triple therapy, beta agonist, and, that's really impressive. So, Trilogy here is product X, I'm presuming or something like that. Trilogy. This is..."
"Yeah, yeah. No, I get it. But I'm trying to just put it in my mind what this is likely to be, versus the Combivent or something like that. That's impressive. Now, what I don't know is, this all-cause death? Are we, I'm reading between the lines. On the first slide you showed me that there's a up to 39% reduction in cardiovascular mortality. So I imagine this is, I have to imagine, you've got to tell me if I'm incorrect in there, but I imagine this has a similar kind of extrapolation that upwards of 40% of these deaths that are being prevented are cardiovascular, are not pulmonary. This isn't PAH, et cetera."
"So, why it's impactful? Well, I think that like many things, for instance, pulmonary hypertension with, say, type-four class, WHO class four, we're going to be WHO class three, I should say, we're going to be pretty keen on using double triple therapy. Things like Tyvaso are helpful here. That's not in here, but there's a general sense that dual and now triple therapies are advantageous here."
"And this seems to be remarkable. There's a highly significant decrease that happens within the first, honestly it looks like it happens within the first, one week at, there's the marker at 10 days here. But maybe even sooner than that you start having time to all-cause mortality reduction. Secondary endpoint, but that's impressive, right off the bat."
"You don't see that the steroids seem to be at least against the muscarinic and the beta agonist seems to be also helpful, which I would've been a little bit surprising there, but, yeah."
"Yeah. So, we usually like to see an NNT around, below 50, but that's still a pretty good number here. I'm just shocked that steroids are playing a huge role here. So the one thing that's really in here is you've added, if you just look at what's driving this, is that corticosteroids are really pushing this, the combination therapy with beta agonists and muscarinic are worse, but you get a salvation when you add corticosteroids, which is not the mechanism I would've thought, that would've prevented cardiovascular mortality."
"Yeah. So, MACE  inaudible 00:44:14  strokes. Yeah, wow. So patients are dying. They're dying from cardiovascular complications and presumably MACE, you define MACE, they're all cardiac as well. Yeah. Holy Crud. This is percent of patients. So it's a small percent of patients that are dying out of this 8,500 as I recall. But, or whatever that number was, I guess you censored some here about 6,500. Yeah. So, one to two percent of these patients are dying across the board. So, about 10% of the death this year is cardiovascular, which is different than the group you had before, about 10,000 patients or 11,000 patients were dying. So not quite as shocking, but pretty convincing here."
"Well, I guess the cause, I'm not sure I can, maybe it's an adrenergic thing. I don't know, but you're using a beta agonist here, so that seems like that's not, but when you drive, from a cardiac standpoint, having MI's non fatal MI's and strokes, you wonder whether you're driving blood pressures, whether you're having plaque instability from adrenergic tone, the fact that you have a beta agonist would actually make that worse. But in fact, you're showing here that the beta agonist seems to be somewhat protective."
"I have to imagine this has to be a systemic inflammatory process that's driven in some part by activation of the beta, adrenergic system. So people are having plaque rupture, both in the brain and the heart. That would be one thought. Hypertensive emergencies here, people getting strokes from bleeds, I'm not sure if I know that I can actually tell you the mechanism. I could hypothesize the mechanism. Cancer is not one of them. Pneumonia is not one of them."
"So in the end there corticosteroids and beta agonists actually are, as opposed to the slide you showed before, are actually preferential, or beneficial, more so, or at least similar to, than using product X."
"Well, it's a little bit discordant with what I just saw a moment ago. The Kaplan Meier showing the huge benefit across the board. I guess this is another trial, different events, I guess another trial, but yeah, it looks like product X is obviously clearly better across almost all except for stroke, better than bata and muscarinic. But..."
"Yeah. Okay. So then 39%, or not 39%. Yeah. That's the difference between showing a bar graph and showing in a plot like that, it tends to magnify the differences, but so I'm a little peculiar here why all-cause deaths, all-cause deaths, so the number across the board, all-cause deaths total is 28, which is a composite 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, yeah. So, the graph before slide five seemed to put more favor of the product X, whereas this bar graph would suggest assuming the patient numbers are balanced, their groups. I'm a little bit puzzled about it right there."
"Right. One's death, and, one's cardiovascular death, the one's presumably all-cause mortality. Yeah."
"Well, patient doesn't really care why they die. They just, in fact, they don't even know they die. Right? But, so the mechanism of the death, probably a bit subordinate to the fact that they die. So your Kaplan Meier's you must have two, you did a secondary analysis in here, so you're throwing, it's not really a fair analysis here, but it's sort of a parenthetical comment that, and despite that product, wait, yeah, that's a bit confusing there."
"So I guess the answer is the patient is patient doesn't care how they die, they just don't want to die. So, if you reduce mortality and a lot of that's through cardiovascular death is what you're basically saying. this is a huge piece of data, but it flies a bit in the face with that slide six, that it looked like, that in fact, death due to just the muscarinic and the beta agonists were actually less all-cause or altogether, than they were with product X. So, you've got..."
"Yeah. So I'm trying to say it more clue that the slide prior to that would suggest, as we said, that it looked like the gray bars, which is the corticosteroids and beta agonist..."
"Performed better, yet all told on the next slide, you're saying the exact opposite, that product X with its triple therapy did better. So percent of patients that see the events are across the board as high or higher."
"So CV death is really what that Kaplan Meier is showing. Right? But then when you break it out to all the other things, stroke, et cetera, nonfatal, et cetera, that's not reflected in this Kaplan Meier, here. So, that all-cause mortality is really a big deal. So, this all-cause is probably the more important slide to be showing."
"And break it. And then the next slide should say, when we break out, tease out mace, which is what I think you do. If you go to slide, can you go back to slide six again, please? I'm don't want to slow you down too much. Yeah. So you kind of break that out. So here's what the composite is. But it's..."
"So here's what I'm going to say succinctly all-cause mortality is unadjudicateable. You count body bags at the end of the day. That is a prima fascia piece of evidence, but people are going to, naturally, want to know what the different pro parameters within mortality, why did people die? Did they die of strokes? Did they die of renal failure? Did they die of COPD exacerbation. So you got to have, but this slide step is your money shot."
"I would just say that at the moment when you were showing me those in those orders, it wasn't clear. It took me a moment to capture that science, that map together just before I picked it up. So maybe that has to do with me, or maybe has to do with the way they're presented. All right..."
"Slide eight. Absolute risk reduction. Single inhaled is  inaudible 00:55:18  landmark. Holy Crud. Yeah. So that's a powerful, powerful statement. Wow."
"Well, as cardiologists, we think that hose drugs that are specifically designed to take care of cardiovascular MACE would be superior. The fact that you have agents here that are as good or better, they're, most of those are or similar or better. It's just hard to imagine. So, as cardiologists, we should be thinking about this in a way that we really have not been. We've been thinking, I intubated you in the beginning of this, cardiologists' a little bit of an island. We get our pulmonologist's help, but we didn't how critical it is, that intervening on a pulmonary side is going to prevent, is going to help both of us out. And you know, we think of it as perfect."
"You've listed four trials that are paradigmatic changes in the way we think. The statin therapy, the RNA therapy, hope with ACE inhibitors and now SGLT2. So, the fact that paradigm, which is out at three or four, four years now is radically changed our care. Your trial X here is on par with that. It just, so this really exactly, as we said, really changes the way I think that cardiologists should be thinking and maybe early referral to pulmonologists is critical and recognizing screening, doing FEV1's, PFTs on patients with a bit more alacrity, a little bit more aggressiveness is key here. Wow, that's where really..."
"Well, it's a complicated question. I think that's going to require, I think three things that will happen. One is, we need to be more aggressive in our screening. Probably need more aggressive in testing, earlier referral to the pulmonologist, and maybe even since these agents are relatively safe. And I say that  inaudible 00:58:13  like Trilogy is, presumably that's another product X or is the product X, maybe starting it ourselves. I'm not sure I want to be that aggressive, but I've certainly started SGLT2's on myself without an endocrinologist. Yeah   00:58:35 ."
"Yeah. That we step out of our lane a lot for these, and now we're doing that because they have cardiovascular implications, not solely in the realm with the endocrinologist. And this is, that's a very good point Mindy."
"This is really remarkable changes in the way I think about that. I don't usually, I usually am teaching not learning. So this is stuff that I learned, I actually learned a lot. Assuming you're not making this stuff up."
"Yeah. I call you in five minutes. Yeah, I think unmet needs in that there's a issue that we need to be more aggressive as cardiologists in recognizing that COPD is a disease unto its own. And patients who have that are going to have overlap cardiovascular disease and death, and mortality, and stroke. All the things that we as CV guys try to work on, but now we know that there's another arm that we should be going after."
"Yeah. Thanks. I mean that, I don't say that often. I usually am teaching, but for once I was learning, so thank you, Mindy. Appreciate it."
Mm-hmm (affirmative). I already have it. I've got the Planning Shop app open and it says waiting for a response from the presenter.
I am. It looks like a word page with welcome on it.
"Absolutely. So I'm internal medicine. I'm a senior partner with the largest primary care independent group in my portion of the state. They're 12 to physician partners. We started our group in 2000. We have an additional 12 employed physician providers and mid-level providers. We provide care only on an outpatient basis. None of us have any hospital privileges any longer. We are independent from hospitals. We do serve as medical directors for two long term care facilities in our area. So we have responsibilities there as well. I have approximately 3,800 patients. My patient panel has been closed for the past decade. I treat patients 18 years and older, which means I essentially treat and prevent cardiovascular disease, chronic medical conditions, and endocrinopathy. So I think that  inaudible 00:05:14 ."
"Typical month, I see approximately 65 patients."
"Okay. So probably 40% have mild disease. 30 to 35% have moderate disease and the remainder are severe. I typically co-manage my severe patients with a pulmonologist. All these individuals are getting annual low dose CT scannings of the chest to screen for lung cancer. And typically any individual who is on supplemental oxygen therapy is being co-managed by a pulmonologist, but the vast majority of my COPD patients, I make the initial diagnosis, I manage and I monitor them on a regular basis. I'd say probably two thirds of my COPD patients are males. I would say probably 85 to 90% of my COPD patients are either current or previous smokers and the rest have never smoked."
"Are on triple therapy? Probably either a closed system or on combination inhalers, I would estimate 20 to... Let's just say 25%."
"So those are almost exclusively severe and, or a small percentage of the moderates are on triple therapy."
"So there are a variety of reasons.  inaudible 00:07:49  may be symptoms. Patients are experiencing either progressive or persistent symptoms despite perceived compliance with their inhaler therapy. And then  inaudible 00:08:06  that in addition to symptoms may be experiencing frequent or recurrent exacerbations of symptoms that either come to my attention in the office, or require an ER, or hospitalization. And then they're the individuals who are having impairment in their activities of daily living. They may be experiencing worsening in their shortness of breath with exertion, they may feel more limited in their abilities to complete their daily tasks, they might be experiencing fatigue during the day, or they may be having symptom waking them from sleep."
"That's a hard one now, because, I mean, cardiovascular has to be ruled out. Are you saying I've already ruled out cardiovascular disease, and now I suspect chronic pulmonary disease?"
"A lot of this is based on history, a lot of it depends on the patients, their demographics, their age, their sex, their concomitant medical problems, their social history, including smoking family history, medications they're currently on. So all of that has to be gleaned before I even touch the patients. Then we obviously to do  inaudible 00:09:56  on them. We want to know about their resting pulse op symmetry, their blood pressure, their heart rate, height, weight, have they had any changes in their weight recently. And then we do a physical exam on them to give us some idea of which direction we need to go. So that part. Then in the office, I mean, I'm going to do an EKG on them. I'm going to do pulmonary function studies on them, just a basic instead of spirometry. Not the full TFTs, but instead of spirometry, to get an idea of FAV-1 and that type of thing, they're going to get lab work. They're going to get a chest x-ray."
"All that is going to be done at the first visit. They may have to come back for a lab only to accomplish some of that with my nurse, but all of that's going to be ordered first time through. And then I'm to evaluate their lab work. We're going to get an idea of their blood count, their chemistry panel, their thyroid profile. All of that's going to be done first time through. Also, we're going to look at their chest x-ray, see if they have evidence for pulmonary disease or not on their lab work. They're also going to have a pro natriuretic peptide level to give me an idea of whether or not they may have a congestive heart failure component, which I will correlate with their EKG, their physical exam, and their chest radiograph. So, if I   00:11:37 ."
"Anybody other than my nurse at this point for this evaluation, I do that. I do it all."
Do a  inaudible 00:11:51  we have obviously a radiology tech/lab tech who's going to do the  inaudible 00:11:58 .
"  00:12:06  first visit right now, right? This is just first visit. So, I mean, there's no reason for  inaudible 00:12:13  anybody else involved until I analyze the first set of data. So, if the patient has an abnormal EKG and it's having exertional symptoms, then yeah, they're going to be sent to the ER, and they're going to be evaluated inpatient for potentially unstable angina. But that's completely separate. So, assuming they don't have any evidence for... Or let's say, I can't determine at that point whether this is pulmonary or cardiac, then I'm going to order outpatient testing to be accomplished in the first three to five days. They're going to get an echocardiogram, and they're going to probably get some nuclear stress test. So I'm going to get all of that stuff done myself. Now, obviously, if they found unstable angina, then they're going to the ER, and they're going to get all that stuff done the same day. And if anything's abnormal, they're going to be admitted and they're going to be evaluated by cardiology at that point."
"So they're told that if they have any change or worsening symptoms, go to the ER. So I don't want them to wait for any of the outpatient testing. But assuming they wait and they have no symptoms, and they get the outpatient testing, and I have one or both of those studies abnormal, then depending on how unstable they are, I'm going to get them in to see cardiology. If they're having active systems, they're going to the ER, where they can be evaluated by cardiology on an inpatient basis that day. If they don't seem to be in that situation, but they still have something abnormal, abnormal stress test, then we're having cardiology see them, hopefully, within the next three to seven days."
"No. I mean, pulmonary in my region, in my area, they've got plenty of other things to do. They don't want to see COPD, unless there's something unusual with COPD. I mean, COPD is something I can manage. There's nothing that the pulmonologist is going to offer them. So, if they have something dramatically abnormal, sure. But I'm assuming that their cardiac evaluation is not remarkable. They don't have polycythemia on their blood count, and their PFTs, their chest x-ray are consistent with mild to moderate COPD. If they're a smoker, they need  inaudible 00:15:15  smoking and I'm going to start them on inhaler therapy at that time."
"Well, if they smoke, if they've got cardiovascular disease, if they've got a malignancy, I'm not sure. You're being rather broad. I don't know where else to go. I mean, if they have any other... If they have any cardiovascular disease, endocrinopathies like T2DM, anything like that, anything that's going to contribute to hypoxia, all those things, make it more difficult for me to do my job. And they've got Alpha-1 and  inaudible 00:16:09  that's a problem. I mean, without more information, I'll just leave it there."
No.  inaudible 00:16:42  that I've already added the cardiovascular disease and the diabetes. Those are the things that concern me.
"I mean, it's not an issue of not owning disease or not managing it. If a patient has unstable angina, they're going to require cardiovascular intervention. They're going to require revascularization, stenting. That's not something that I do."
"Sure. I mean, you asked me when I'm going to send the patient to cardiology."
"They're going to see cardiology if they have unstable angina. If they have no evidence for unstable angina, then I'm going to manage them going forward at that point. I can control their blood pressure. I can control their lipids. I can do all of that, but only if they need revascularization or further evaluation, that's when they see cardiology."
My line is cutting out. I'm showing three bars.
"Okay. I mean, if they just... I'm evaluating their risk for cardiovascular disease at the beginning, when I didn't know what was causing their shortness of breath. So I have a fairly good idea at that point. Now, if we're just treating COPD, I've done their work, they have no obvious cardiovascular disease, I still need to consider cardiovascular risks when I'm initiating their inhaler therapy."
"Every me medication, even inhalers have potential risks associated with them. I mean, they have a benefit risk ratio. I might consider certain inhalers, certain therapies more frequently based upon their likelihood of having concomitant cardiovascular disease."
"I will use all of them. I will use all the inhalers. I'm a little bit more hesitant with some of the Beta-2 agonists, some of the long acting LABAs, per se. I'm a little less concerned about the LAMAs, the anti muscarinic inhalers. So I might lean more towards the anti muscarinic receptor inhalers before I go LABA therapy. I also am a little... I probably reserve my inhaled cortical steroids for second line therapy. But otherwise, I'll use all the inhalers if I think they're going to benefit from it."
"Okay. You just asked me how many have a risk factor, not necessarily have documented CBD, correct?"
"Probably 70% have some risk factor, either age. I include male sex as a risk factor. I include hypertension as a risk factor. I include tobacco use as a risk factor. So a lot, even though they don't have symptoms or documented CBD, have in theory, what people consider to be a risk factor."
"Gender, age, tobacco use, hypertension  inaudible 00:22:15 ."
"I think it depend... Okay. So this is a little bit more complicated. So if they have documented coronary artery disease, and they had some revascularization, either stenting or bypass, those individuals are automatically seen by cardiology in my area every six months. So their cardiology's separate from me. Now, if they haven't had a procedure, they have no reason to go back to see cardiology. I am seeing them as a result. So I am managing whatever cardiovascular risk factors they have. I am managing COPD."
"I can currently manage both of those,  inaudible 00:24:18  to end up seeing those individuals more frequently, because I'm probably going to be managing hypertension, lipids and COPD. And to do all those things, as well as routine health maintenance in a 15 minute appointment, is not possible. So I'm going to see them on a quarterly basis to make sure that we have time to address all those issues, as well as all the routine health checks that come along with what their age is."
"So I'm less likely to use combination therapies. I'm more likely to start with single agent therapy and then add on based upon their repeat spirometry, based upon their symptoms, based upon their ability to perform their ADLs. My rationale is more medications I add, the more potential adverse effects in drug interactions there are. So if I can control a patient's symptoms with one inhaled medication, I will do that. But because I am seeing them on a quarterly basis, if they report any progression of symptoms despite being compliant, I will add additional inhaler therapy at that time."
After they have not succeeded in one way or the other with combination dual therapy.
"I think I'm not convinced there's a difference in the frequency of their exacerbations. If an individual has risk factors for cardiovascular disease, I don't think that I treat them any differently. The one time they are treated differently is if an individual does have CBD, documented CBD, then we're more likely to be aggress with their exacerbations. They're more likely to be routed directly to the emergency room, where they can be evaluated more rapidly, and they can be screened to make sure they're not having unstable angina prior to initiating their treatment for the COPD exacerbation."
"No. I don't think I'm more aggressive, because these people are having coughing and shortness of breath. So we're treating all of those people. The only you want to do is, when they have heart disease, you want to make sure that their symptoms are not somehow due to something acute, like an MI. So that needs to be seen before I actually initiate therapy."
"I think that you're right. I mean, I think they're connected. I think for many decades, they were considered completely separate entities. I think that we're learning a little bit more about the hormonal and the endothelial relationship between the two. Then again, I have a fair number of people that have one, but not the other. So, I think every patient is unique. I think there is some overlap, but I hesitate to generalize too much. And there are no specific guidelines, per se, that necessitate treating them in similar fashions. So even though there is some overlap and the risk factors can frequently overlap, I don't have a medication necessarily that addresses both cardiovascular disease and COPD simultaneously."
"I mean, I think there's some impact, some influence. I'm not sure whether or not I've ever seen a study that shows why patients who have COPD necessarily... Well, I don't know what the incident is. The increased rate of cardiovascular disease and individuals who have COPD, why that might be for some people and why it isn't for other people. I don't know the answer to that. I'm sure it's probably out there, I'm just not aware of  inaudible 00:30:18  study."
"Well, I think  inaudible 00:30:36  as a COPD exacerbation. I mean, I think it does increase mortality. I think it does probably, if they have CBD, it increases their risk for sudden death. I mean, they lose a certain amount of pulmonary function, documented pulmonary function with each exacerbation. So I think optimally controlled COPD without the exacerbations is in all likelihood going to prolong an individual with CBD's lifespan."
"I don't know the answer to that. I have not noticed. I can't say. I don't know the answer to that. I mean, I think that if someone has well-controlled blood pressure, lipids and sugar, optimum body weight, don't smoke, I don't know whether or not that lowers the exacerbate... Well, obviously the smoking portion. But I can't say for sure that it decreases the frequency of exacerbations or slows the progression of their COPD down."
"I think that's more likely. I mean, again,   00:32:11 . When you lose lung function from exacerbations, it stands to reason that you're going to increase your risk for sudden death, particularly if you have documented CBD."
"It's not surprising. I've never seen... I can't remember seeing a composite of... This essentially looks like a meta analysis that includes approximately 15 to 16,000 patients. And it suggests that 39% of deaths were due to of CBD. So that probably is not surprising. It's probably a little bit higher than I would've anticipated, but it's overall not surprising."
"No. I mean, despite the frequency of COPD, I mean, CBD it's number one in three cause of death in the United States, so that's not surprising. And it speaks to our need to optimize therapy for their CBD risk factors, as well treating COPD to prevent progression of disease."
"I'm not too sure. This slide is very confusing. This is not an easy slide. Based on how it is set up, it's confusing. So I have to just go through this. I'll be ready   00:35:47 ."
"Right. Part of what I'm supposed to do, I think is indicate you when something is unusual. This slide is very difficult to understand. Hang on. Increased mortality. Okay. So I see all the numbers. I mean, the gist of this is obviously the two. Having both is worse than having one, but the numbers themselves are very difficult to understand."
"Right. Now, now ischemic heart disease. So, this is an individual that has coronary artery disease and probably has had an MI already. So these are much sicker people, but I would agree with you. I mean, it is definitely worse."
"No. I mean, COPD needs to be treated. The risk factors need to be addressed. But there wouldn't be as much COPD if people didn't smoke. So those are all that we try to instill upon our patients."
"This is a useful fly. It actually put the number on this as far as the increased risk for strokes and MIs following an exacerbation. I mean, I alluded to that, but I didn't know that the figures were this high."
"No. I mean, I expected that a COPD exacerbation would increase the risk of an event. I did not know that a risk for a stroke was increased by 40%, and I didn't know it extended out to 10 days."
"So it means that... I mean, you really want to prevent exacerbations, so you really want to your COPD pay patients on maintenance inhaler therapy, which can, in theory, reduce the number of exacerbations."
"Okay. So this is the deal with COPD. So reps have been calling on me for multiple decades, trying to tell me why I should be using... Why all of this should be using their respiratory inhaled therapy in COPD. And for decades and decades, the industry has never been able to say, the use of my inhaler on a chronic basis prevents death. They've never been able to do that. It's only in the past several years where some companies now have all cause mortality data. So now you can legitimately say, using inhaled therapy for COPD prevents death. And this slide demonstrates that."
"And more physically, it demonstrates to triple therapy, is more efficacious at reducing all cause mortality than do a therapy."
"Well, yes, I understand. I mean, what would be nice is if everyone, in theory, could go on triple therapy from the very start. But the reality is from a cost perspective for some patients, from a desire to minimize the number of medicines they use, some patients are just not going to want to go on what are the two closed triple therapy options that are currently available in the market. But the numbers do suggest that there is some benefit earlier, the better."
"Well, this information looks like it's directed to a healthcare provider. Is that not correct?"
"If 20 years ago the makers of... Let me find an example of Advair. I mean, if Advair had showed me this 20 years ago, that everyone would be on Advair. But at the time, nobody could say that using their inhaler prevented death, nobody. These are new endpoints that have been successfully achieved in recent studies."
"Yeah, that's interesting. That's an interesting slide. There's a lot of stuff on it. It doesn't quite get its point across as quickly as the prior slide, but it does funnel you down a path that you can clearly see that the difference in mortality was due to cardiovascular disease."
"If a patient has moderate disease... If a patient needs to be on triple therapy, there shouldn't be any hesitance to initiate triple therapy."
"Well, there's no difference in CV deaths. The difference in CV is between product X and the LAMA/LABA combination. There isn't really CV death between product X and the inhaled steroid LABA combination. So,  inaudible 00:46:01  Advair, Dulera, Symbicort versus product X doesn't show a difference in cardiovascular disease. The difference in death, really, was positive. So I don't know what that is. It's the LAMA/LABA class that really stood out being a differential. I mean, the cardiovascular deaths are significantly higher in the LAMA/LABA combination."
"Actually, it's split between the two. Usually they are starting with monotherapy. So they're going to be starting with either a LABA or a LAMA, and they're going to get  inaudible 00:46:57  of the other one, either LAMA/LABA, based upon their response to therapy. And usually the inhaled steroid because of the increased incidence of pneumonia, it's going to be the agent added at that point."
"It's interesting, but you're going to want to see it in more than one study. I think that it's going to have to be replicated, but  inaudible 00:47:41  demonstrate that a product X lowers the incidence of MACE. Then no one can argue with the benefit of that type of inhaled therapy."
"Actually, the incidence of confirmed MACE and non-fatal stroke was actually higher for product X than in the steroid lab accommodations."
"I have to think about that myself. So, it may be the LAMA. It may be the LAMA that's in the triple therapy that is doing it, because as the LAMA/LABA combination obviously has the highest incidence of confirmed MACE. So, that would imply that the LAMA is the issue."
"I don't think that... I do think that is an impressive number. I do think when this is born out across additional studies, I do think that this is going to probably significantly change how we deal with COPD patients going forward. If, in fact, it does demonstrate that Lama use. Either monotherapy or in combination therapy, increases the list of cardiovascular disease and COPD, I think it's going to dramatically change things."
"I think that we will probably decrease the place on the hierarchy at which time we initiate LAMA therapy, if at all."
"The triple therapy which obviously contains a LAMA product in it seems to  inaudible 00:51:42  than the LAMA/LABA combination. The triple therapy, the only difference is it includes an inhaled corticosteroid. So we will probably skip that entire LAMA/LABA dual combination, and go any monotherapy that they have to be on, to either a LABA/inhaled corticosteroid, or triple therapy. We're going to skip that LAMA/LABA."
"  00:52:17  the Anoros,  inaudible 00:52:17 , the Bevespis, we're going to skip that class."
"Correct. Because clearly, at least in this data, product X shows enhanced benefit as far as reduced cardiovascular mortality versus the LAMA/LABA."
"That's a good question. I don't know the answer. A lot of that's going to depend on their insurance coverage. There are generics there for ICS/LABA, where there are obviously no generics for closed triple therapy. But I like the triple therapies out there, because some of them are monotherapy... Some of them are single dose, once a day. That really answers compliance. So I suspect that going to close triple therapy once a day, first is not an issue, then that is certainly a very viable option early on."
" inaudible 00:54:02 . Just in risk reduction for mortality, that and verses EPO, one Paragon,  inaudible 00:54:20  versus ACE."
"If this is replicated, it's certainly a significant reduction in mortality."
"It does. It just suggests that it perhaps may represent a paradigm shift. All the other studies on the left are very, very famous studies that  inaudible 00:55:48  acted upon the care the care that I offer to patients. So, if this data on the right is legitimate and holds to be true, then I expect that we'll be using a lot more triple therapy versus LAMA/LABA."
"Well, this study doesn't really... I mean, these slides don't really discuss very well what the mechanism of action is. I mean, there's obviously something going on here that does increase the incidence of cardiovascular events and COPD patients that seems to be mitigated by using product X. I think if nothing else, without digging a little deeper into pathogenesis, I think that it's safe to say at least that we'll be using more closed combination therapy earlier on in our COPD patients to prevent exacerbations, to keep their symptoms stable, while in theory bring their risk for MACE."
"No, that's going to be me. Cardiology  inaudible 00:58:03  inhalers. They're sadly going to be sending  inaudible 00:58:07 to me to address modifying their inhaler therapy. So this is just something that myself and my primary care colleagues and mid-level providers are going to have to be aware of."
I don't think it addresses an unmet need. I think that would mean that people who aren't on a medication of any type are going to be put on a new medication. What this means to me is that the choice of medications that we use is likely to be different going forward.
"I think that for most medical providers, it's rather obvious that their COPD patients are at higher risk for MACE. It is nice  inaudible 00:59:43  has finally responded by developing trials that have demonstrated that the use of a specific product may reduce the incidence of MACE going forward. So I think this is a welcome bit of news. And I perceive that it does impact on how we will prescribe inhaler therapy to our COPT patients with concomitant CBD risks going forward."
Thanks for being on time. You have a nice day.
"Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for patiently waiting. We do have the respondent on the line. Our moderator, her name is Mindy. Mindy, your line is so open, you may begin."
"We don't need the screen today because that was a big thing in the directions, and now here we don't-"
"Yes. This is a solo medical practice on an island on coast of Southwest Florida. They're not landlocked. We have a bridge. Population is mostly, this is why I do so much of this work. They told me when I first started my own practice out here that they're going to be 60 years of age and older, and I've never had this many elderly patients."
"So when you get to that age, you live long enough to have all these cardiac and respiratory problems. I always had a working class population, they don't have half these problems. So I really had a brush up on geriatrics."
COPD is very common. I do probably at least 100.
"Right. See, this is the prominent. Now, this time of the year my snowbirds are coming down. We get the lodge by snowbird. So these are people with  inaudible 00:04:17 . They don't anymore. I manage them even if I can, they go back north because the doctors up there understand they blow the elderly off."
"I'm from New Jersey and if you're over 65, put you on the shelf. So our doctors are used to an older population. What happens with most of the snowbirds, they come down here they go to our physicians, including me. My workload really goes crazy during snowbird season."
"Not too many, mild. If they're mild, they're so mild they don't usually need me that much. In fact, it's very difficult to try and get somebody to use a maintenance inhaler when they feel fine. So I would say maybe 20% mild and the rest moderate and severe. It's pretty evenly split, maybe 40 and 40."
"Oh, that's getting more with time. See, once trilogy came out, I just was like, ""Oh, how great is this?"" Now we have Breztri. So as time marches on, I'm putting more and more people on it."
"It's moved up. Originally it was like, I wasn't too familiar with it and I just tried it. But now depending where you are or how serious the COPD is, use it right at the outset."
"Well, your pulmometry has to be going further down. You have to be symptomatic with coughs, we have productive mucus, that type of thing, getting worsening, shortness of breath or not ..."
"Here's another thing that I find with this that I like, compliance is better because it's all in one. The more you have to get a patient to do the lesser they're going to do it. So I like it for our compliance sector too."
"Well, if I have them on say Brea or something like that and I don't see any improvement in them or they don't feel any better with time, I'll put the triple on."
"Yeah. First of all I have to try and figure out where the shortness of breath is coming from, the respiratory or cardiac sometimes. I just had a guy about a month ago, it was actually both. So that makes it more complicated. In fact, we even said there's such a thing as cardiac asthma. I have to determine what's causing the shortness of breath."
"No. Most of the time I know where it's coming from. This guy was a relatively new patient and actually caught me off guard though. He didn't have any real tumor. He had a metal valve, but he really didn't have heart disease. Not in the history he gave me, though he did when I worked him up. And then when we were doing treatment on him, he actually had an MI. So sometimes you think you know it and it gets more complicated."
"All right. I usually do an EKG echocardiogram from a cardiac standpoint. Make sure it's not valvular or do blood work and get cardiac enzymes, that type of thing. I'll make sure that's not doing it. And then from a rest standpoint, depending on an O2 sat, they have any spirometry, I try and do a more recent one. They usually had one ages ago."
"Yeah. I have to do PFTs. That's part of the ... Yeah. I say spirometry, but that's all in that."
"Now I got to work on that depending what it is. Because see, now I have to decide what this strictly cardiac, doing most of this or is it the new respiratory things getting worse. So depending with cardiac issues like it was with this guy needed treatment, it was heart failure."
"I refer for stress testing, and they know that about me. I just practiced 11 years. I use two different cardiac groups and they know. They go to the cardiology for what I need that I don't have, and the patient comes back to me for management. The only way they would do it, if I needed a pacemaker put in or something like that, they do a lot of the testing that I don't have available, but I even can get my own  inaudible 00:10:54 ."
"This will help you understand why I do so much, and I didn't mention this. Prior to opening the practice up in Tampa, I was a hospitalist. So the patients were admitted to me and that's why I can manage things that most primary doctors ..."
It's going to be the same thing. The O2 sat when I first see him. Pulmometry-
"No. Not always, no. I try and do my own. I have, I just found a pretty good one. What I have is using ... In fact, he was that good. He used to do a pulmonary rehab, but he retired. And then the other guy, I didn't like at all. So I might get more involved with the pulmonologist now that I have a better one. So I started doing a lot of it because I couldn't find a good pulmonologist."
"Probably all of it, because I'll pace off. Even my renal disease patients, I manage them until they need dialysis. Actually a lot of this is co-management."
"Well, depends what it is. Heart disease, valvular disease, AFib. In fact, it was me. I had a patient that developed eosinophilic asthma and I picked it up. And when I sent her to this new pulmonologist, he was blown away that I even knew this, but I had read articles about eosinophilic asthma. I did two blood tests on her. She had elevated eosinophils."
"Well, I would like so, and I can't generalize now. I'm going to have trouble with that because my patients are really, I have a varied mix. There's not a one-size-fits-all. Now, I was an RN for 22 years, so-"
"That's getting more common also, now because we know how to diagnose it. It was always there. We just didn't know how to diagnose it. Some of these doctors don't know about it, so they're still not managing it, and the patients are wondering why they're not getting any better."
"Cardiac heart failure have to be the number one, because the constant battle between the lungs and the heart. And renal gets in there too. I usually get stuck with three of them: heart, lung, and renal. I need the diuretic to take them out of heart failure, but it's killing off the kidneys. So I'd actually say it's a threesome. It's almost like a triad, the three of them: renal, heart, and lung."
"I probably see my COPD patients monthly. And they're going to the subspecialist three months, unless they're on a certain med or something that I'm sending them out for."
"If I have to send them out to a pulmonologist, there's something not right or patient's not getting better and I want a second opinion."
"Yeah. The real problem in primary care, when you're a subspecialist all you worry about is the heart, the lung, or the kidney. When your primary care you constantly have to worry about what you do. The one system is going to mess up another system."
"Usually when I'm doing COPD treatment, I try not use nebulizers in because one, there's nowhere to go after that. So I don't get them right using nebulizers. I don't know what else you want. See, I don't know where to go with this conversation. I'm not sure what you want."
"Well, they have that, but the COPD treatment isn't going to help the heart."
"I have 100 COPD. Maybe at least 30%, maybe 40."
"Yeah, I'm going to do EKG echocardiogram. That's my baseline."
"Heart disease. Well, most all my patients have hypertension disease. That's almost like a given. They all have hypertension, and most of them have CAD. A lot of them have PAD."
"Oh, that's interesting. I don't think one could take precedent because they're both pretty evenly ... If someone's short of breath, unless I can determine that the shortness of breath coming from the heart versus the lungs, I'm not going to prioritize. So it would be concurrent unless I know if they're fatigued, getting more winded, then it's usually more studies to see, so I can determine what area I have to work with."
"No, not really. It could, but it doesn't."
"Because I'm just looking at it from a COPD standpoint. Again, I've gotten really good results. Maybe if I didn't, I wouldn't be so apt to use it."
"Yes, I would. Because you know what gets in the picture and I had mentioned, pulmonary hypertension, another real problem I deal with. So to your question, yes."
"Well, yeah. See, and now we're getting right into that season when the weather changes. And even down here our weather gets colder. I get more COPD exacerbations in the winter."
"Yes, because what I see the one triggers it off. It's a domino type effect. One's not fixed, it aggravates the other one."
"Yes. Probably if I'm not seeing enough improvement and I'm thinking, well, what else do we need to do here?"
"A lot of times I'll ask them and they'll throw it back to me. I'll say, ""Do you want to see this patients?"" A lot of times they'll say no, just do this, this and this."
"Most of the time they'll see them for stress testing. Most of these people have to have nuclear stress testing. They can't walk on a treadmill. They can't breathe to begin with. So they'll do that for me. Based on that, we'll go from there."
"All they worry is the heart. That's why I said, that's the beauty of being a subspecialist."
"Right. They don't have to coordinate it. I only know that from being in the hospital it's because the patient was admitted to me and all the subspecialists were like, ""Oh my goodness, don't even look at that."""
"Well, I'm not always sure which came first, the COPD or the heart disease, which caused which or aggravated which, so I just manage them as I see them. You can't prioritize, I don't think one over the other."
There has to be because one's going to trigger the other.
"Because I've noticed in the past when I have had patients that their COPD is a holding pattern, I notice the cardiovascular situation seems to stabilize also."
"Oh, same as, should or could, would, you can do any of them."
"Well, what I noticed with my heart disease patients and that also have COPD, and I picked this up by default who I've also read it, but I picked it up by default that their COPD doesn't seem to trigger off as much if I've got their cardiac STARS."
"But I just read an article, not that long ago about this exact thing about heart disease and lung disease."
"Yeah, I was looking at the graph to see what was what."
"Yeah. Well, you can definitely see here in the graph, the cardiac related is really pretty much up there with the respiratory, except in that first and second one. You look it towards an uplift, they tend to be a little closer."
"Well, it looks to me like it's fun to say that they didn't really die of COPD, they died of cardiac or cancer."
Yes. It's like the article I just read not long ago. I don't know where that article is. I usually say stuff like that that's really ... It's a new thought that I don't know that people thought of before.
"Well, it's scary because I have so many people with COPD. Now I have to worry is the COPD going to go into other stuff like the heart who don't have heart ... If they don't have concurrent heart disease, now I have to worry, or not worry, but I have to be more in tune to that. But that's one of the questions I ask in a new patient anyhow, family history of heart disease was more in tune to when to worry about heart disease coming through."
"Yeah. See, I didn't know the actual percentages, but that's really kind of significant."
"Yeah. The percentages, there's an increase just looking at the phases. Ischemic heart disease, COPD up 40% to 140%, heart failure, 30% to 90% versus COPD alone. See, this is a concept that I don't know. I think this maybe needs to have a CME on it. The doctors do for license or board eventually. So I don't know how many people are really tuned into this."
"Well, it's not that new to me. Remember I said I just read another article about... Calls me a professional. I get a lot of journals. I do a lot of reading. But I'm wondering if others ... Remember you asked me, does a cardiologist ever help me with other problems and my answer to you was no?"
"Again, I think what happens they're only worried about their own organ."
"Yeah. Got to be, I guess, you'd say more aggressive because look at these numbers, I didn't remember the numbers being this ..."
"Yeah. See, this reminds me of that patient I was telling you about. I said he had an MI. This is kind of, even what I've seen without reading it in print."
"Well, there are a lot more intertwined than I think any of us even knew or finding this out. The data, these graphs I'm seeing now are really ... The article I read didn't have graphs like these. This is mind boggling actually. I said, ""You guys need to do a CME on it or something like that, that more people are aware of the connection."" I don't know it's going to solve the problem."
"Like I said, the pulmonologist, they're only worried about the lung. They're not worried about the heart, send them to the cardiologist for that. Sad, but it's true. I only know this from being a hospitalist."
"Yeah. Well, see, that's why you guys have to appeal to the primary. Because the primary has to be aware of this in order to worry about it more, COPD as the subspecialist."
This is of all cause mortality. Wow. That's significant because you're talking about all cause mortality. It's not just saying cardiovascular but respiratory.
"That would make you want to learn more about product X. See, there again, when you're working with the physicians, you have to capture their attention. Something like, to get them to want to read further for the one  inaudible 00:37:07 . So it kind of does it."
"Well, they're putting product X on with the LAMA and the LABA. What I'm looking at, they're not using it in place of, they're using it in addition to."
"Well, it's going to be another med. This is a real problem when you get elderly patients. They'll tell me all the time, I'm not taking another med, even when it's just vitamin or something else, only a vitamin. Even the younger population, they don't have that many meds. Maybe this needs to be in the geriatrics."
"See, people are on a lot of meds to begin with, find that bulk them into another med. But most physicians, they write thinking that the patient needs it and they don't worry about  inaudible 00:38:42 ."
"Yeah. See, and I could show them. See, most people are very visual. You have a visual age, you can get their attention better. The talking most of the time doesn't have enough impact, because sometimes-"
"Oh, okay. Well, it's again very compelling. I was just looking at the numbers and it's very compelling for you to want to use it because not only you getting-"
"Yeah. The fact that you're getting, not only the respiratory, but the cardiac improvement."
"God, I have a good cardiovascular's plan to attend."
"Well, it goes back to what we were talking about earlier, that cardiovascular disease is more intertwined with COPD than we realize. You can't look at them individually, I guess."
But I know the one will trigger the other because that's happened.
"Well, you can see here we go again with just using LAMA and LABA much more significant than if you put the product X on it."
Yeah. I wouldn't have expected to be that much.
"Yeah. It's showing its more impactful than I even realize, but the other slide same way, the numbers were really ... The graph is one thing, but those numbers are really impactful. Percentages that you had in an earlier slide, I think it was slide two or three, that really drives the point home."
"When you see how the product X, the event's really change."
"Yes, it does. Because again, here you're seeing the numbers and I think that's helpful."
"It's fairly great. Again, it's a relatively new concept."
"No, but this one's very impactful. This one is really impressive too because you can just look at the graph, see the difference when they added on product X."
"Well, trial Y and X these are trials with this new drug. They're not   00:48:40 . You're putting them in there. I see I'm confused. I don't know what I'm looking at here. This trial Y and X didn't really happen. You're having this with a new drug or  inaudible 00:48:52 . Maybe I'm not reading this."
"Yeah. I'm pretty good with glass and slides, but I'm having trouble figuring this one out. Well, you even said you don't ... But I'm not-"
"I'm not reading this thing right. Because I'm familiar with all this, except the first trial, I don't know that's Scandinavian. I'm with familiar with those cardiac trials. Now we got a product Y in here. We only had product X before. Where is product Y coming..."
"Then if I leave that out, what the takeaway I'm getting, you've got better risk reduction with product X than you did with adding on a statin. Like everybody has to be on a statin. Everybody has to either to be on a  inaudible 00:51:19 . So this is showing you that this product X is really even more significant than... It's interesting that this SGLT2 never was in there because boy, that's where we are today. Boy, they are driving that home crazy and I've been using them too. And so that is significant as you look at product X and the SGLT2, like Farxiga. So that's significant. That's probably what I'm seen here."
"Well, it kind of sums it up, I guess. Remember one of the slides before, it talked about all cause mortality, there was a reduction, it wasn't just in cardiovascular disease. So it's doing more than what we even realized."
"Yes. It's doing the exact same thing that these diabetes meds are doing. They came out for one thing. Now we finally do all this other good stuff. So this is the same story. Not only helping the lungs, it's helping like it was, everything."
"Well, if I wasn't already aware of it, which I was, but not to this thing. Remember I said that when we first started looking at the graph, I saw the numbers, percentages, that was really much more significant than I had anticipated. See, and what helped with that, these are done in graph form or numbers form is reading a paragraph. Sometimes I read right over the numbers in a paragraph, it was more impactful the way I read it. So I'm like, this is really impressive. I think this is-"
This is the way this needs to be marketed.
"Well, now we're going to add on another med. Again, sometimes maybe you can sell it easier if it's... You can show all cause mortality. In other words, we're not just saying heart fun, we're talking about everything. Geez."
Yes. And respiratory. So it's getting good bang for your book sort of.
"The fact that, and finding more and more out that we didn't know before and what you do, the one system is impacting other systems. See, which is really that's what primary care is all about, what medicine's all about. What I do, the one system really affects another. So that's what this is saying. This drug is saying, look, if I use it for this, I want to get all this other too."
"Well, what I  inaudible 00:56:06  the one time I sent somebody to the cardiologist and he was really impressed when he saw, I added on the SGLT2. He says, ""Boy, who's your primary?"" Remember I said I used two groups of the one group. He says, ""Who's your primary?"" He was really thrilled. And this was a couple years back when I had done this, starting it, and he was really amazed. So it's going to be the same thing. It's going to jog their mind, that maybe he's read it and now he sees the primary is doing it."
"Well, it's a different now. A lot of times they'll tell ... I don't usually see them do these, either leave it up to me, but I don't know what they do with other doctors."
"Yeah. I think it's me doing it. And then that I refer patients to them for something. See, that I already had the patient on these things."
"I'm waiting to see this come out in an article where I can save the article. It is really impressive of these numbers. I say again, when you read the written word in a paragraph, you might read over it and it doesn't have the impact. See, the way these graphs were done, it was very apparent, you didn't have to read a whole bunch of wordy things. You could look at the graph and see the data. So it's very impressive for the design and the way this was very well done. I don't normally see things as well done."
"Yeah. Goodnight, hun. You were really very good too. See, what made you good, you really knew your material. That really does help."
Stay safe now that we're back to this again.
You're going to wind up getting that COVID shot when you get your flu shot. This is COVID I think it's here forever.
"All right. Done. Okay.  inaudible 00:59:29 . Oh, she going potty. Comes in and go potty instead of going out there, isn't that funny? She's out there. She comes in and goes potty."
Yeah. But why wouldn't she go potty outside. Go figure. And you still can't seem to get that thing working.
"Yeah, because I didn't want ... Well, I turned the volume down for that reason. The girl went  inaudible 01:00:08  and a half. But that volume was coming up, but I turned it down for the TV. That's a music station that I listened to on the car, 9405."
"No. Actually, we get it on our TV now too. I don't know how Jim got it. It came up. He didn't even want it. This came up on the television."
"Music stations, yes. You click on it, you'll get the music station. Why it's coming up on the TV, I have no idea, but it up on ours too."
"I have a solid pulmonary practice. I'm in a large suburban area from a major city. I've been practicing a little over 20 years. Well, it's more on clinical right now, than the hospital stuff. So some people get sick enough and get in the hospital, but I find one of the points to my career is to try and keep people out of the hospital."
"Age tends to be older, usually over 60, unless of course they've been heavy smokers or had a lot of other exposure. And they really run the gamut from mild, not needing much of anything in the medication to severe needing a lot of medication. The thing that I think is very interesting as of late, is this whole overlap syndrome, where some of these COPDs apparently have asthma as well. And that's become very intriguing."
"  00:03:38  patients as I would say maybe, seven on triple therapy."
"Yeah. Most of them I usually start out, well it depends on how bad they are, if they're mild, I just put them on single therapy. But I have no problems advancing them to moderate therapy, if they're having maybe more than a couple of exacerbations a year though, I would put them up there on triple therapy."
"Yeah, monotherapy if it's mild disease. But a lot of times I don't get them mild because they've already been in their PCP, and they've been taking other medications. So, we usually-"
"I will try different things sometimes. Yeah, sometimes dual-action bronchodilator  inaudible 00:04:43 , or sometimes I'll just try beta-agonist and with a steroid. I've never been terribly enamored with the effect of the steroids on these individuals. But as I say, having become exposed to an understanding a bit more about this asthma component, which is a different lung disease, that some of these people have. They maybe need to have their asthma treated as well, for those people. Yeah, for the steroid."
"Basically trying to get as much background information on them to begin with, want to make sure they don't have any underlying heart disease or other issues. Once I decided it's intrinsic lung disease, again not spinal problems, arthritic problems, heart problems going on. Then I'll do pulmonary function tests. You always... everybody gets a chest x-ray as well. And then proceed from there. Then start them on medication. Because by the time they've gotten to me, they have some problem and do not feel well controlled or adequate controlled. It's not questionable let's wait and see what happens. It's a question of, ""Okay. What medicine do we start with?"""
"If I have any... No, I see how they are clinically, if there are the risk factors, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, things like that. Then I may want to get other tests done such as an echocardiogram, if I'm not really sure based on the history, the way they tell their story, what makes them short of breath? I may actually send them to a cardiologist. I may empirically, even put them on some bronchodilator. But if I have a concern, I will either tell a PCP or I will send them back to their cardiologist for further evaluation."
"Well, this the cardiovascular condition has to be controlled and it's not to say, that they don't have a pulmonary condition as well, but I will give due respect to that specifically, avoiding anything that might stimulate the heart. Certainly having them having breathing problems, respiratory issues or exacerbations. That's going to strain the heart too, but basically stay away specifically from bronchodilators."
"Yeah, we see what kind of response they have to inhale. Usually something short acting in the office, just to see how well the they are or are not doing with it. And based on that, based on the severity, how well they function. You've seen inhaler, I'll determine what type of medication I want to have them on, whether it's an inhaler, a nebulizer, or maybe even some tablet."
"Hypertension, diabetes, and other cardiac disease. Obesity is in there too, I'm not sure if you could see that as disease. But that's a factor for a lot of people."
"Well, the concern is always treating the disease without causing other problems, other diseases. You obviously want to try and avoid cardiac stimulants, if they have cardiac disease or things that might get the blood pressure up. Obviously, you want to try and avoid steroids if possible, simply systemic steroids or inhale steroids aren't a problem. But systemic steroids, if they're diabetic, because that will just shoot the sugar away up. So, you're looking out for what other land mines are out there."
"I'm sorry, what? Could you ask that question again, please."
"Well, I will certainly evaluate all those situations where I may be having some impact, either by design or just by fault. If I'm giving off course of steroids, I'll tell the diabetic, ""Sugar may go up a little bit for a few days. So you have to cover the interest yourself."" If you're using bronchodilators, you got to tell them not to overuse their bronchodilators. Because that will surely get their pressure up. Again, but the people who have serious heart disease, and I tell them to avoid bronchodilators altogether.   00:10:02 ."
"If they're my patients, but a lot of them come from their cardiologist or their PCPs, more often from the PCPs. And the PCP's easier to say, ""Fix the problem, and I get them back to me."" There are some people who do anything to my patient without telling me, or without my input. And that's okay. But this day and age where everybody's so busy, most of the people are saying, ""Okay, fine. Do whatever you do. If pressure goes up a little bit, adjust their medicine, just let me know what you're doing so I can put it in the record."""
"For some patients who don't have a PCP, I come to me first because of their breathing problems. And I say, ""Your pressure's up, you do anything about that?"" And they say, ""No."" Or other issues, I will handle those myself. If it's basic blood pressure management, that's not too challenging."
Yes. Somebody's having an arrhythmia. The cardiologist will be managing that arrhythmia.
"Oh, yeah. Obesity, blood pressure, I mean diabetes itself is a cardiovascular risk factor. That's what you're asking about, cardiovascular risk factors?"
"Yeah. Again, it's in that 40% group. I can't say exactly what percentage, whether it's half that 40% group with comorbidities or two thirds. I would say probably a quarter to a half."
"I would say the people I have who have COPD, once we get started with them, it's probably maybe 5% that continue to smoke."
"I'm pretty comfortable with dealing with it. I mean, we all went to medical school. We all learned about these things. Again, I'm not going to be deciding what antirrhythmic to use, if somebody had the arrhythmia. But if somebody has atrial fibrillation, I mean, that's pretty straightforward in terms of the medications to use for that. And obviously, make sure they don't have any risk factors for pulmonary emboli or something like that sort. If somebody has high cholesterol, it's like, ""Okay, we have one problem is making shorter breath."" And I tell them, ""If you have a heart problem to clogged arteries, you're going to get short breath of that. And there's nothing I can do about that, except me having a cardiac stem put in."" So that usually gets their attention, because nobody wants to go for surgery these days either. So work on that, and we try."
"I would certainly probably have an endocrinologist on board, if the diabetes was getting a little bit out of control. Some people are very straightforward, take their medicines while on their diet, and things are good. Some people are just like all over the place, and whether sugars are all over the place, they're-"
"Yeah. Well, having uncontrolled blood sugar's a cardiovascular risk   00:14:20 . Somebody they can get dehydrated from that, more risk for infections. And again, they usually have my cholesterol as well. It's talking to people who just have my cholesterol without diabetes."
"Really the only thing that's main, is whether or not they can use on the others properly, some people can, some people can't. Especially if they're older, they have ones,  inaudible 00:15:10 . Just can't coordinate the spread and breathe."
"Yeah. Well, certainly you have to be careful about the medications used, because some medications certainly are higher doses, can have some effect on the lungs as well. So, low dose of beta-blockers, are okay. High dose of beta-blockers is not so okay. And people usually have some swelling already. So if you're using calcium channel blockers, some calcium channel blockers are notorious for causing leg edema. Those are things that are consideration."
"My decision for treating their COPD in terms of how aggressive I want to be, is not really based on the cardiac disease. Certainly I may have feel that we have time to treat and reassess the treatment, as opposed to if they have severe unstable  inaudible 00:16:48  having a problem, we need to eliminate the symptom of shortness of breath, this from a picture. But also keep you in mind that, ""Hey, this person may be looking at getting a cardiac standard bypass tests, sooner rather than later."" Which case you want them optimal for that surgical procedure."
"If I have been able to get their other risk factors under control, then I would say maybe 5% of the time. If I can't control their risk factors, specifically, think about the cholesterol lipids. Then I may send them sooner rather than letter, because they're not listening to me-"
"They do if they're having a problem maintaining them, because they may optimized or have eliminated any possible cause for a cardiac etiology of the shortness of breath. And so they're saying this person must be all COPD, so fix the COPD."
I think we just take care of our little piece of it.
"I think they're very tightly interrelated because of the inflammation and maybe going on in the chest. I have often requote, what I was quoted to me by a person I consider an expert, Philadelphia. And interesting statistic that, do you know how many people we have to treat with  inaudible 00:19:28  to prevent a heart attack? That's a rhetorical question. You probably don't... But it's 44. And do you know how many people you have to treat for the COPD to prevent a heart attack? The number's 10. So, there are four times more likely to have a heart attack from COPD, than they are from the cholesterol."
"Yeah. You can improve the relative risk, less than the risk if you will. However you want to call it."
"For just the statistics I just quoted you, you have people of a COPD who are at a higher risk for having heart trouble than other people. Certainly they can also depend on how bad the COPD gets, they can have a right-sided heart failure. And that can be its own issue, becoming more sedentary. They then develop pulmonary embolide. It's just like a snowball effect."
"It can be only in that, it's not so much the lung that is becoming worse, but they become more decondition as they cut down your activity levels. They become less functional and they, I guess, suffer the effects for lack of a bag description of the diseases, rather than an actual physical measurement. I mean, there is measured loss over time of lung function. But still the condition of the sub-patient is also important."
"Fits along in general. I mean, people who have COPD usually have it, and 95% of the time from smoking. People who smoke get different kinds of cancers. And it tends to be older individuals, generally older men. And so they tend to die from cancer. So I'm not surprised about that. Obviously they do get some cardiac diseases. Again, older people get cardiac disease. So I'm not sure I'm going to make a one-to-one relationship level, between one disease and their deaths. Everybody has to die from something."
"Other?  inaudible 00:24:39  that was a graph. I was looking at the wrong spot. Again, not a surprise, not a surprise at all. And again, all the individuals and certainly in this country, generally bad health, high cholesterol, probably eye sugar, overweight, things like that. So I'm not at all surprised."
"Doesn't make me think any more differently? We're differently  inaudible 00:25:14  if that's the right word. But anyway, it doesn't make me think any differently about it. I find that they have two separate diseases and yeah, there is a kind of like a Venn diagram, there is overlap. But my point of treatment or practice, is to try and have them as functional as possible, to keep them as mobile as possible. Keep their quality of life as good as possible."
"I'm not sure what's going down there on the lower left. COPD plus heart failure. I mean, 30% to 90%. That's a pretty big spread, I mean, there's a very big spread on some of these numbers, so I'm not sure how to interpret these things. I mean, the fact that the coexistence comorbidity exists. Yeah. Statistically, I can't address these numbers here."
"Comorbidities increase the risk. I just have people who have heart trouble or lungs disease tend to get less active, less mobile, and therefore their quality of life decreases. But also their care for their other underlying conditions, gradually deteriorates as well."
"Well, that's sort of an own acting of a medicine and more diseases you have, the more likely you're going to have problems. So yeah. I have trouble accepting that fact. You're putting percentages on there, I'm not sure I can do that."
I think it's more like validating what I already think.
"Because as I said before, the risk of a CV exacerbations, greatly increases your cardiovascular risk."
"I'm not sure how to comment on that, because I'm not sure I thought about it from that perspective. It's something that's there. And how much is a little bit, how much is a little bit of elevated cholesterol versus a lot of cholesterol? Some people don't care what their cholesterol is. Some people don't want to have cholesterols 10 points above normal or expected. So, the more there is, the higher risk can be, but I just don't really find that it's changing my approach. I mean, anything is not acceptable to me. The little bit of risk from my perspective, patient may have a different perspective. But from my perspective, any risk is too much risk."
"That is news to me. I've never heard about that at all. I've never thought about that at all. Can't say I've observed that at all. So that's an interesting thing. Maybe while going forward, I'll consider that. But I can't say I've seen or heard about it."
"No, as I said to me, it's pretty much spot on. And again, they don't know anything about the stroke risk, but the rest of it is spot on."
"It's interesting in terms of the reduction of overall mortality, I would be more inclined to see what the nature of their diseases are. Of course, we always want more information for that. I think it's kind of interesting that how much it would appear that the addition of the steroids and inhale steroids, does seem to bring down the mortality risk. I haven't seen in my own experience that there's been that big of a difference in terms of, the use of some type of medicine versus other types of medicines. Again, I don't know what the patient population is here, but it's interesting. It certainly will give me something to think about."
"Well, one, you have a dual bronchodilate arm, which seems to have the worst or the highest... I would say mortality. I wouldn't say the highest. Substantially reduced by inhaled steroids with the long-acting muscarinic. No. So long-acting antagonist, be a type bronchodilator. And then finally there's a triple therapy, which seems to have the lowest mortality risk. Which is not insignificantly lower than even just the inhaled steroids, the bronchodilator. So there is gradual segmental improvement."
"I think so. Certainly it will make me take another look at where things are going, how I want to approach things."
"Well, it seems like the addition of these inhaled steroids does seem to improve the mortality or lessen the mortality I should say, improve the statistics for people in general. But that  inaudible 00:33:02  cause mortality."
"All right. I just don't want to take a chance with getting cut off again. It's not problem on my end, but somebody people get calling in and I tried to get rid of them basically."
"Yeah, no, it's interesting that did they actually put the number needed with the..."
"Two bronchodilators. Yeah. The question would be really how much better is it, with the triple therapy?"
"Oh, that's okay Versus LAMA/LABA, which is 58 to 198."
"Yeah. It's actually interesting though, that the inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilator had a little bit left issues within even the triple therapy. I'm not sure why that should be."
"Well, the three graphs on the left confirmed-"
"Well with all of them, it seems like... Well, not all of them, I guess the first one or the third one, it seems like the triple therapy had more events, than the non stroke and the major cardiovascular events. But in the confirmed major events, it seems like the dual bronchodilator seems to have the most events. So it seems like the steroids do reduce it a fair amount."
"It does seem to be that again, as I said from before, the major events with the dual bronchodilator seems to be the biggest one for cardiovascular. In terms of cancer death, I mean, it's like way down there. It's almost statistically insignificant, but I think the fact that you're seeing so much more with just the dual bronchodilator without the steroids, is impressive."
"Yeah. We're talking about 1% on either one, I'm not sure if that's statistically significant there, so I'm not sure that's making a whole lot of difference for me. I mean obviously, it is still a little higher with the dual bronchodilator, as opposed to the others with the steroids. So, clearly the steroids would of some benefit here."
"I think so. I think I should be introducing the steroids a little bit earlier, than we already are."
"Dual or triple, and as with all things in healthcare these days, the bottom line is the bottom line. What are the insurance companies going to go for?"
I think I'd probably still be going for dual therapy.
"Because it's at least as good, if not better than triple therapy."
"The graphs. The graphs are clear and linear in terms of how much benefit. And sometimes there's a lot of benefits, sometimes a little bit of benefit. But The benefit is there with the dual therapy."
"It's Significant to me. I mean, talking about 13% improvement, 13% reduction not to be CV death."
You're looking at two different variables then.
"All right. Well, it certainly looks like it has more of an effect on the cardiovascular disc than the overall mortality, but it's still is impressive, important."
"Well, it's nice to have some clear, obvious, easy to read numbers versus having to go through any statistical analysis or look for numbers. But the graphs are very nice in terms of showing that or substantiating what you said. But I think they both kind of support each other, the graphs and the numbers."
"That's great. The fact that it can have bearing on other disease processes, which we know are related to the exacerbations. If we can produce one, maybe we do reduce both, then I think that's important."
"A couple of questions. Why are we looking at other diseases or other medications I should say, for diseases? Unless you're looking to say this is better than these other treatments for cardiovascular risk, but we're discussing inhalers here and why showing the two different studies? I mean, you need to know, the trial sizes, maybe some other parameters."
"I'm aware for the one with the SGLT, two inhibitors. Yeah. That I'm familiar with the other ones. I don't recall seeing, I may have seen them. I just not remembering them. Again, most of these are givens because this is standard of care now."
"Well, the other products of course are in standard of care now. And so are you saying that these inhalers should be standard of care, because they show at least as good, a little bit more improvement in the risk reduction, that all-"
"I would be looking at them in their benefit, their own environment, not compared to other medications used as other treatments, statins, pressure medication, inhibitors, SCLT2. I mean, all these things have shown benefit and are used, but the question is, of course, what do the numbers look like on the inhalers, and why should we be using them unless they do show good risk reduction. Regardless of how they compare to any of these other drugs, which do they do in different ways."
"I find it good. It's certainly up there with at least the best of them, number to three is 80. And it has some impact. It has some distinct impact."
"It doesn't necessarily change my understanding of the link between the two diseases, but it would certainly change my approach in how I'm treating the different diseases to COPD anyway. To keep that under control, to avoid cardiac mortality."
"I think people will tend to get more aggressive even with mild COPD, because you can have risk reduction here. Just in the same way as we've starting putting people on the SGLT2 inhibitors, before those are medications developed for use in diabetics, but it's shown independent risk benefit for cardiac conditions. So, if it works, it works, we don't necessarily have to say, it can only work in one disease and not another disease. If we find things work, we use them."
"Yeah, I will. I mean, I said I already do prescribe it, but it's definitely going to change how I look at the situation from here on out. Because of these kind of statistics that I wasn't fully aware of."
"There are inhalers out there. So I think the products are out there to be used as with everything people have to realize, what's the issue and what's best treatment for that? And that's what it comes down to. And even for myself, I'm always looking at how you do it better. Things can always be better. How do you do it better? And as I say, seen that now."
Okay.   00:54:28 . Have a good day. You too. Bye. Bye.
"I think there's a mix up with the technical logging information. I just got a text message, then when I went to my email, there was no link."
"And so, when I called the number on the text message, nobody answered. Then finally, somebody called and then I got this link and I got on. But there was no phone number with it, it was just a link."
"I see now your message. Yeah. I guess when you wrote that, I was probably in the process of dialing in."
"So clinical cardiology and internal medicine in the suburban area, high Medicare population; so older patient population. Hospital, probably 40% of the time and office, 60% of the time."
"So with CAD, obviously, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, whether that's COPD, a number of pulmonary fibrosis, diabetes, probably 30%, and anemia. Those are the comorbidities."
"A lot of that is secondary. I may not be the primary manager in diabetes, but there's now an overlap of diabetics with heart failure."
"So we're using diabetic medicines more frequently now for heart failure. So you're in a position where if it's heart failure, I'm a little bit more primary with some of these diabetic medicines."
"And then, of course, secondary for some more hardcore diabetics; those requiring insulin, et cetera, that they need an endocrinologist or their primary is managing that predominantly."
"If there's a diabetic patient that is either not well controlled or having complications from diabetes, they tend to do the main workup of the diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy."
"I'm involved in the cardiovascular care for these diabetics, especially, if they have heart failure or if they have known CAD, then I manage that part with those diabetic medicines."
"So it's a little bit of a co-management, but primarily they're doing more of that hemoglobin A1C and insulin lowering."
"Many times it's probably the chronic kidney disease and hyperemia. So issues with electrolytes in kidney. In some of my patients, I tend to be some of the more primary manager of that."
"If I get a patient that comes in with shortness of breath with no clear reason, then I certainly start out with an EtG, blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation."
"An EtG is done in the office at the first visit. And then usually, I want an echocardiogram which is ordered not necessarily done in the same visit."
"So an echocardiogram would be the absolute next step, from my standpoint. Chest X-ray is also ordered at that visit; that's not done at my facility, so that's sent out."
"And then you try to get blood work, if it's been done already by the primary care physician. So they're coming to see me as cardiovascular specialty."
"Then, a lot of times they have blood work already performed previously. And depending on the situation, I may add an extra blood work like a BNP, where I ask them to go get that performed if they haven't had that."
"I tend to tell the patient that we're probably going to start off with a cardiovascular workup first, with the understanding, if we don't find any issues or any abnormalities, then the next step is an extensive pulmonary workup. And that may involve a consultation with a pulmonologist."
"I would say 30 to 40% of the time, because shortness of breath is pretty nonspecific."
"If they present with history of smoking or if they're still smoking, I think you're going to end up doing some common pulmonary workup, for sure."
"If they present with symptoms of wheezing, for example, that's also an indicator that you may need to do both workup. So those are usually the two scenarios."
"Yeah. There may be an overlap. For example, a chest X-ray may be ordered by me, but anything additional, I tend to want the pulmonologist to do that. Especially, pulmonary function tests, and if they want to CT scan the chest, for example."
"So COPD, if they're really requiring management, so the primary sometimes just may give them an inhaler. But if they're extensive, more moderate or especially severe COPD, I think pulmonologist is usually recommended, at least from my standpoint."
"Some medicines can affect their heart status. So there'll be some patients that may be, for example, in theophylline, and that can increase their heart rate."
"So that may affect my management of any arrhythmias or cardiovascular disease, especially, if their heart rates are elevated. So a lot of times we try to titrate. Our medicines are changed to more lung friendly beta blockers, for example."
"Or if I have some patients with pulmonary hypertension, like a WHO Class III, for example, I'm monitoring their echo and their pulmonary pressures and trying to work with the pulmonologist, if there's any concern of the pulmonary hypertension getting worse."
"Yeah. Probably on a respiratory standpoint, I tend to have pulmonary hypertension patients, small amount of WHO Class I, obviously, a lot of WHO Class II from valve issues."
"So I do tend to manage these respiratory comorbidities through echocardiographic follow-up diuretic therapy, because some of them have right heart failure from their lung disease."
"And then, an overlap of some medicines like the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, endothelium receptors. I may use those on those pulmonary hypertensive patients."
"Not so much I'm using inhaler therapy for COPD, because again, that tends to be given out by the primary doctor or the pulmonologist."
It tends to be in the pulmonologist domain.
"On a rare occasion, I may give a short-acting bronchodilator. But I haven't done anything more extensive with that."
"I'm very concerned because I get a lot of patients. Especially when they end up in the hospital, they have both. They have COPD exacerbation and CHF exacerbation. A lot of times it's a combination of retreating."
"So I have patients that are likely going to be treated for both comorbidities that they end up in the hospital. And if they're short of breath, you tend to treat both issues because you're not really sure what's causing what."
"If they have a COPD exacerbation, many of them may get hypoxic, and that tends to increase the risk of ischemia. So from a heart condition, these patients may end up having either arrhythmias, or they may end up having cardiovascular events due to their poor lung status."
"When they come to see me, I'm always asking if they've been in the hospital, and we're able to get records. And also, we tend to have records communicated back and forth between specialties."
"So if they've had a visit with a pulmonologist, I'll get a copy of that note with their primary doctor. So we're communicating."
"Yeah. For COPD exacerbations, it does. Because if it's severe and they end up in the hospital, they tend to get treated sometimes with either adjustment of their medicines or their medicines are changed."
"And so, sometimes when they come back out of the hospital, they have a different medication profile. So it can affect what I've been doing in both good and bad ways."
"Yeah. We can get access into the hospital through the EMR. But most of the time the patients come to the office with paperwork, and their discharge medications, and their discharge paperwork, so that we can review it."
"I think they're intertwined. Because most patients who have COPD, they've had some risks that got them there, and that's usually tobacco use."
"That also is a factor for cardiovascular disease. Many of these patients have underlying heart failure with their COPD, so they tend to be very similar."
"The COPD itself, any chronic lung disease can increase demand on the heart muscle. So whether that's through hypoxemia or that's work of breathing; tachycardia."
"A lot of these COPD patients have tachycardia, they have arrhythmias attributed to their underlying lung disease. So all of that increases their risk and management of their heart health."
"I think management of their COPD, if they're on inhaler therapy and they're responding well, then that's fine. I think it's all about managing their COPD and their oxygen status. And of course, if they're still smoking."
"There's a lot of patients that also still smoke. But I think it's an issue, was making sure that their lung function is as optimized as possible."
"Yeah. Like I said, a lot of the COPD patients have concomitant arrhythmias. And so, and I think the arrhythmia, again, is affected by the status of their lung function and their oxygenation."
"And also, the type of medicines that they're using. So we want to be careful about medicines that could interact with the heart muscle or the heart arrhythmias and make things worse."
"That's a tough one. I think it's more predominantly, COPD affecting the status of cardiovascular disease than cardiovascular disease affecting the lungs, per se."
"I think it depends on concomitant issues like that. For example, pulmonary hypertension, so if you have a valve issue, managing that valve issue aggressively and having that stable and controlled, will lead to less pulmonary hypertension, then in that regards, I think your pulmonary status can improve. So   00:42:01 ."
And pulmonary hypertension in relation to heart valve disease.
Yeah. I have many patients with the COPD condition worsening their heart disease.
"If you have, certainly, end-stage cardiomyopathy or end-stage heart failure, those patients tend to have worsening lung disease because they may have fluid overload."
"They may be presenting with CHF exacerbation, which, of course, worsens their respiratory status. That's the subgroup of patients from a heart standpoint."
"It looks like cardiac related issue issues are very risky for a COPD patient, based on these studies as compared to other causes. I don't know what others are."
"But it looks like if you have concomitant CAD or cardiac issues, you're going to increase your risk of death, and if you also have COPD."
"No. I think seeing cancer as a significant proportion of cause of death in COPD makes sense. I don't know what they mean by respiratory related, I'm assuming infection, but nothing that really stands out."
"I guess the top line, ""Patients with COPD have few times greater risk of having cardiovascular disease than those who don't have COPD."""
"So I would definitely agree with that, at least, from my clinical experience. In specific, we talked about heart failure. Ischemic heart disease and heart failure with COPD, absolutely. So, yeah. I do see this."
"From a clinical experience, I think the information in a slide presentation certainly, for sure, it makes it very clear."
"So going back to what you and I were discussing, this is what I see clinically, especially in a hospital. If you come in with a COPD exacerbation, you're more likely to have increased risk of cardiovascular issues, because you're putting more demand on the heart. This is very much what we see."
"No. Just that it's more of a risk than I thought. Just because, again, you have numbers here. I said, a risk of MI doubling in five days is significant. So without this slide, I wouldn't have realized it's that much."
"I probably didn't think about stroke as much, because I don't necessarily deal with stroke. But certainly, 40% increase in 10 days, that's a big risk and I don't think many people are aware of that."
"I think the likelihood, as I can imagine what the graph would be if it's a severe COPD reaction."
"I said that, this is what happens with moderate. I can imagine what happens with the severe COPD exacerbation."
"Whatever product X is, that appears to be reducing mortality significantly. You've got a significant P value. was that 49% relative risk reduction?"
"Good number needed to treat, so very good data."
"Some of the studies are now focused on number needed to treat, and you see the number needed to treat a 50 or below even. So 80 is still very good."
"But for a COPD treating medicine, I'm not aware of many trials looking at COPD medicine that provide this type of mortality data."
"I think it's meaningful because if I have a patient that has COPD and they have an opportunity beyond some inhaled medicine, that's going to be reducing their mortality this much."
"And especially with patients that I have in common with their cardiovascular risk, I would want the patient using this medicine as compared to other inhaled therapies."
"We have communication through notes and office notes that we send back and forth, and it's very collaborative also in the hospital. And so, you have discussions with the pulmonologist routinely in the hospital."
"Because again, we're getting called for shortness of breath by, let's say, the hospitalist, and they're calling pulmonary and cardiology."
"So the communications is well written on the notes, and you can say, ""Listen, this patient might benefit from, for example, product X, because of their cardiovascular disease and risk, and their COPD exacerbation history."""
"The only thing I can say is that, putting together steroids with those two other inhalers makes a huge difference."
"If you look at the phase three, criteria that they're using, they had monitor to very severe COPD. Those are the exact patients I would consider."
"So these are patients who have a longstanding history of COPD, they've had exacerbation, they have well documented COPD."
"The take-home is that, cardiovascular events was the cause of mortality. And in particular, especially nonfatal MI."
"Because when you're in the hospital seeing these patients, we often have data like troponins or cardiac markers. And so, it's very quick to see if there's any concern with MIs, or demand ischemia, or an indication that the patient has had some cardiovascular event."
"So nonfatal MI is very easy to determine by blood work. And if that's reduced, that's a big deal for some of these patients."
"I don't know what to make of that. I would think that with inhaled therapy and steroid, that you would've had some improvement on respiratory deaths with the product X."
"So I don't know why that's the case. I can only say, that's a good thing for the cardiovascular part of it, but it's odd that the respiratory didn't get any benefit."
"There was a low amount of respiratory deaths in general. I could see where pneumonia may not be an issue. But with COPD, the percentage overall is very low. So most patients, it looks like they don't really die from their lungs, they die from their heart. That's all I can say."
I don't know if I necessarily think differently. I think my clinical experiences at COPD is a significant comorbidity for CAD or CBD.
"And that treating COPD and giving them more stability in their pulmonary function and status, is going to improve their cardiovascular event rate."
"That if you treat these patients with this combination, inhaler therapy, that hopefully they'll, number one, unlikely be admitted to the hospital."
"Second, their lung disease is going to be more stable. And third, that they're going to have reduced risk of a cardiovascular event."
This is good that you have a breakdown on cardiovascular death in particular.
Yeah. It's huge. So I think just seeing the 62% underneath the 49% is very important.
"If I have a COPD patient with concomitant heart disease, which I have a lot of, I would want this patient to be in this inhaled therapy."
"Yeah. This is a great slide, because it's looking at pretty significant recent studies paradigm, and these are the most recent."
"And those number needed to treat were very good. So if you have this number needed to treat of 80, that's pretty impressive."
No. Just that number needed to treat of 80.
It's in line with very impressive recent cardiovascular studies. So I think what we found is the dynamic of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
"Especially, in particular, certain medicines that aren't for diabetes. And now we have something particularly focused on COPD. So it looks like there's a dynamic there that needs to be pursued."
"Probably this is not something you have, obviously. But it's important to have some safety data and long term, because you've got an inhaled therapy that involve steroids. Any potential long term side effect of the steroid would be helpful to see."
"But the way it looks is, I think there's a good potential for having these patients with COPD, especially if they're moderate to severe, having them on an inhaled therapy for the cardiovascular risk reduction, assuming that the long term safety data is acceptable."
"I believe so. I think inhaled is definitely better than systemic, or oral steroids, or IV, of course. But you still want to just have an idea that any potential long term side effects or chronic steroid use, even in an inhaled form, you want to make sure that that's trust."
"Yeah. I think when you're dealing with more advanced COPD, these patients really should be under the care of a pulmonologist."
"Because you need to determine why you're calling it moderate versus severe, and that's with pulmonary function testing, and things that really should be done in the care of a specialist."
"Yeah. So for example, I would put in my note, ""Patients scheduled to see their pulmonologist would recommend consideration of product X."""
"I don't think, certainly, pulmonologists are aware of the potential with the product X reducing cardiovascular events this much. So I think it should change their selection of inhalers."
"There's a lot of inhalers out there, they're very expensive. And I'm not necessarily aware of any significant improvements in mortality, certainly. So I think it would really... I don't know the cost of this. But it's combining three commonly used inhaler therapies."
Great. All right. Enjoy the rest of your day.
"So I'm family medicine trained, I'm board certified. Currently right now, I am working in an urgent care setting, so I see acute patients and also patients that might not be able to get into their primary care doctors. And I work in a group setting outpatient within the hospital system."
"I think in total, probably around 10 to 20."
"So typically, when I see them, they are usually coming in for new symptoms. So my job is usually to see whether or not they're in any acute exacerbation, and whether they would benefit from outpatient treatment versus going to the emergency room, or if there's something else causing their symptom flare up."
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). So typically, I check their med list and see what severity they are based on what inhalers they're using, and depending on if they're mild, modern, severe, or if they have a history of significant risk factors and they sound like COPD but haven't had an actual COPD diagnosis. I start with giving them rescue inhalers, and then I use steroids and also antibiotics."
"Yeah. Usually, I'll see them once and if they happen to come back a few days later afterwards to see me again, it's usually by chance or if I tell them like, ""Hey, I'm working this shift later this week. If you're not feeling better, come and see me again."" That's usually what I'll do, but there's no definite like, ""Oh, I want you to come back within a few days and follow up."""
"Usually, I don't start them on any sort of maintenance therapy. I usually, if anything, I might refill whatever medications they might already have."
"Sorry, I heard only half of it. What did you say the first half of it?"
"I mean, I feel like it's pretty convenient. That's the first thing I think of, because a lot of times patients don't even know what inhaler they're talking about. And I just think that it's probably easier just for one inhaler to use just for convenience sake with adherence. And I think that if they would benefit from it, they would be more likely to use that than three different inhalers of the same one. So."
"Probably not. Unless there was some other... If it was a huge cost, I think that would be the only detrimental side that I would think of."
"But otherwise I don't see why I wouldn't be able to recommend it, at least medically."
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). (silence) Okay. Yeah, I'm done."
"The main takeaway I get is that COPD affects a lot of people. Just based on the large numbers that are thrown at me, is that it's extremely common, there's a lot of resources being used and that's the impression I get. (silence)"
"Something that surprised me, but when I thought about it, it's not too surprising is that over half of patients with COPD are undiagnosed. And that's just because in my own practice, I feel like I see people that I feel like would have COPD, but they've never been diagnosed by it for whatever reason."
"And I'm like, ""Oh, I don't know why these people haven't been diagnosed with it."" But it seems like it's not just my population, it's pretty common."
"Let me see. (silence) So I don't know if this is something that you would necessarily call an improvement, but I thought it was intriguing that you listed the top three causes of death, but then you go from COPD and then to six and the nine, trachea and lung cancers, and then diabetes. I thought that was just a little weird to put the top five as... It's almost like a top five graphic, but you included number six and nine, so I just thought that was a little bit weird."
"Credibility? Well, credibility, I would say lower end, maybe a three."
"Well, I mean, I don't see any source of the stats, so I just don't know where the-"
"Oh yeah. Yeah. I see them now. Okay. I see them now. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Okay. Well, I mean, assuming that the sources are listed, then I would raise the credibility number higher. But that was just my impression, because I just didn't see where the stats were being quoted from, that's all."
"Yeah. I mean, I think I already am relatively more aggressive with treating people that I think might have underlying COPD that are not diagnosed. But when I see the over half of patients with COPD are undiagnosed, I think that I'll continue to do that. Because I sometimes question, I don't know if I'm being too aggressive with my management, but now that I see this stat, it make me think, ""Okay, I should try to be more aggressive because they might have undiagnosed COPD."""
"Well, main takeaway is that I'm surprised at certain countries that how high the mortality rate is compared to other countries."
"So. And then makes me think how the risk factors are and trying to piece together why certain countries might have higher than others. I just assumed for instance, well, at least in the US, a lot of it it's just from smoking, but I tend to forget that other countries, they might have more pollution or byproducts that might cause it too. So."
"Oh, okay. Relevance is probably a two or something."
"Yeah. Because I mean, I don't see myself going around the world doing medical mission trips or something. So I feel it just might be too big of a scope for me."
"I was really surprised that 50 to 70% of COPD exacerbations are not even reported. That's the one thing that I took away from this, that people are undiagnosed, and I wonder if the exacerbations aren't reported because they're undiagnosed."
"I don't think so. I think that was the biggest stats. Actually about the 50 to 70% of COPD exacerbation, that's more than every other one. So I felt like that was just a big number to me."
"Yeah, it just seems like it's one of those, it's illustrating that it's just like a downward spiral, literally. When you start to have one exacerbation and just gets worse from there."
"No, I think it's pretty clear and gets the point across."
"Yeah, it's mainly the 50 to 78%, because I think it ties along with whatever number it was that are undiagnosed. Because sometimes I tell people like, ""Hey, you should follow up with your primary care doctor to talk about getting PFT for instance."" And sometimes I don't always do that, or for instance, I don't always ask them about smoking cessation, but I feel like I might be more aggressive towards pushing for those things in my next visits."
"Main idea I get is that, after exacerbations, where people are in the hospital, sometimes their lung functions never really go back to where they once was. And just combined with that graphic from the other slide, it's like eventually over time it'll just go lower and lower."
"I mean, I would like to... I see the FEV numbers, but I would to see if there was any change in quality of life or reduction in function in addition to the numbers going down, just to correlate that, to see how it would affect patients."
"Well, I'm saying that just because, if they're in a lot of respiratory distress, when I see them in the office, I'm typically sending them to the emergency room anyway, and I won't be able to... And I usually don't follow up with them, so I don't really get to see if I...I never get the chance to reorder a PFT or see how they're doing after the exacerbation to really use the info in this graphic."
I still feel like I'm going to be more aggressive with my treatments for people that might not be diagnosed.
"Basically, there's a very high mortality rate that correlates with the frequency of acute exacerbations, definitely."
"I think the 80% with two moderate exacerbations within one year, that's a huge number. And also, how few that you really need. Because I feel like there are a lot of people that I know that might, at least during residency, they would have multiple exacerbations during the year. And so it makes me think about how they're doing basically, because it's been this many years since I left it, so. Or since I last seen them."
"Yeah, I think they are. I think mainly the, like I said, not necessarily the bolded numbers, but definitely the amount of exacerbations there, because there are several times a month where I send people to the ER and they do get hospitalized for their COPD exacerbation. So."
"Main idea is that other than just the lungs, there's also cardiovascular risk too, and there's a huge correlation with worsening COPD exacerbations and also other organ involvement."
"I think the 90% increase for up to a year was surprising. I mean, I always think that all these are related, so there probably is going to be an association to somewhat. But I think that the 90% increase definitely surprised me."
And the fact that it's up to a year after an exacerbation is surprising.
"Yeah. I mean, I think I was more drawn to the right side. But yeah, the left side just didn't impress me as much."
"I mean, I don't think it has anything too surprising. So I'm not too surprised with the numbers out here, just based on my previous experiences and everything. It's kind of, I feel like you just don't have only COPD. It's just people with the COPD usually have some kind of hard kidney metabolic disease too with it. So I'm not too surprised by this picture."
"Yeah. Mainly because, like I said, I only see them in the acute setting, so I don't really manage any of their chronic conditions, usually."
"So I feel like I'm not going to be treating their COPD and diabetes for the same visit compared to as if I was primary care and I was seeing them and making that adjustments like that, so."
Definitely that cardiovascular disease and COPD are pretty closely linked.
Confusing? Not really. I think their graphics are pretty clear.
"I would just say maybe the bar graph on the right, making the lung cancer and the cardiac related more different in the color. I just feel like they're really similar and so that's just one thought that I had."
"Actually, I'll lower that, I'm going to lower the credibility to a four or three."
"Yeah. Then I saw on the bottom though, the study was conducted between 1986 and 1989. And I feel like there's been a lot more in terms of development of new meds and changes in society. And I feel like there should be more up to date clinical data."
"Yeah. That COPD and cardiovascular disease again, are pretty closely linked, that you probably, if you do have COPD you most likely have some kind of cardiovascular disease in the mix there, so. And definitely they feed off each other pretty well and yeah."
"I think the shared risk factors one had me look at it a little longer to make the connection that those two graphics are the same thing. So if you were to just make it so that the flow sheet just had shared risk factors and then made those two underneath it, I think that it would be a better label for it."
"So basically, it's giving me signs of what to look for in order to optimizing their management. So in their history, have they been having a lot of exacerbation, then just their function level and also their lab counts it seems."
"Yeah. I never thought about it because when I see that, I think of like, ""Oh, asthma."" But I have had people that had concomitant diagnoses of asthma and COPD. So it does make sense, but it just never, what's it called? I never make that connection. Or at least they don't think about it like the first line."
"So definitely, it hammers on the point that, once you have exacerbations, you're more likely to have more of them."
"Definitely, the time between exacerbation shortens. I didn't know that it was shorten that much, but yeah."
That basically there's an association between worsening symptoms and then risk of having an exacerbation.
Definitely the one and two. That's basically 50% stats. So that's pretty surprising.
"Yeah. Again, I can say that it's using like, I just feel like it's using older data. That's all."
"That eosinophilia basically there is an association between like higher eosinophil account. Or sorry, when you control eosinophil counts to the number of exacerbations that you have. (silence)"
"...the eosinophil counts with ICS, there's an association between less exacerbations."
"I don't think it's too surprising when I think about it. But I was always... Well, I don't think it's too surprising when I think about it. No."
"Yeah. Because I feel like usually, when I see patients, I don't usually... If I see someone that I suspect has COPD, I don't think knowing their eosinophil count will have a huge change in whether or not I treat them for an acute exacerbation. Maybe, again, if I was in a more primary care setting, I might try to add on an ICS earlier if I saw that. But again, it doesn't really pertain to my practice setting."
"Yeah. I'm surprised that they're saying that a stepwise treatment progression is not really helpful it seems, just based on the graphic. That it pretty much allows for a disease progression."
"Yeah. Because I think I was taught mainly that it's kind of like a stepwise approach. Like, ""Hey, based on this gold criteria and the symptoms that they have, the exacerbations that you have, you benefit from a LAMA/LABA first. And then if they're moderate, then you add on the ICS. And then this is basically kind of going against that."
"Yeah, I mean, if I had to, I would consider combining things more earlier."
"Basically, there are a lot of things that we can do to help reduce exacerbations."
I'm surprising that smoking cessation is only at 22%. I thought it would be higher.
"That basically, COPD even though it's hugely prevalent, it's also underdiagnosed, and there's just a lot of mortality associated with that and that there are ways to improve management with medications."
"Yeah, I mean, I think I might, like I said, well, based on the last slide, I actually was surprised that pulmonary rehab had a higher chance even in medication. So if anything, I might counsel people to be more active or try to ask their follow up physicians if they are involved with pulmonary rehab. But overall I think that I'd be more likely to maybe even consider starting something on someone that wasn't undiagnosed as a maintenance medication."
"Yeah, at least in some areas, it seems like it does a lot back than the LABA/LAMAs. I think that there's some of the graphics that show similar efficacy with the ICS and LAMAs I think that they looked at. But definitely some of their  inaudible 00:51:26  are impressive."
"I think towards people that have a higher eosinophil count, they might benefit the most from it."
"Yeah, I mean, like I said, I don't really use it, but I don't see myself using any sort of maintenance inhaler right now. But I think that I would consider it if I were to think that, ""Hey, this person has undiagnosed COPD, they maybe are on the verge of having something mild after I acutely treat them,"" Maybe I'd consider this if I had blood work and I saw some recent labs that might show that they might benefit from it."
I would think that C probably fits that the best of these four.
"And then B, I don't think it's that compelling."
"A, I mean, I think that it's nice to see the stats, but I feel like the graphic on C with the downward spiral, I think it makes the point more clear than just stats."
"Yeah. And then D, I think that it's something similar. I think that if I were to rank it, it would be C, D, A and then B. And so I think that C is a lot more friendlier in the message."
I feel like I... Wait are H and I the same as the ones that I saw from above or?
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Let's see. I would say, O."
I think that I would keep that order. Yeah.
"Yeah. So I would say, starting on C, big picture is that the exacerbations pretty much results in a downward group decline and function. And that definitely, even mortality risk is higher with more exacerbations, and not just with lung function, but there's also cardiovascular risk and that each further exacerbation kind of comes sooner than the one before it. And in order to slow that down, you have to be pretty aggressive with the treatment."
"Yeah, definitely just because I think that it advocates for starting multiple ones at once, rather than a stepwise approach and waiting for things to get worse before you add something else."
"So I'm a Pulmonary Critical Care Physician. I work in a single specialty group. There are 10 of us in the group. We all do inpatient and outpatient medicine. I think our time is split roughly 70% on the inpatient side, where we work in the medical intensive care unit and also do a pulmonary consults in the medical wards. The other 30% is in our outpatient clinic where we see a typical mix of community pulmonary problems, including a lot of COPD."
"I have a pretty low threshold to go to triple therapy. I think it generally, the side effects are toxicity  inaudible 00:02:34  inhalers are pretty small. So I sometimes in other aspects of medicine, I think less is more, but in COPD I think more is more. So if they're still having symptoms, I escalate their inhalers until I get the triple therapy pretty quickly."
"Gosh, a severe exacerbation, I think lines them in the intensive care unit, either on a bipap mask or intubated, and I think a moderate exacerbation just lines them in the hospital on the general medical wards."
"I think so. I think, especially since it's been easy to put them in one inhaler, I've been using it more and more earlier on in their disease, probably."
"Well, they have different medicines, but for me practically, it's the availability of samples in the dosing regimen. And because of those two, I probably go to  Trelegy 00:04:06  90% of the time."
"Gosh, I don't know if there are any specific trial outcome differences. I view them as pretty interchangeable and do an equivalent clinical job. So in terms of outcomes, I view them the same. Again, the specific thing is that Trelegy, I can just tell them to take once a day whereas  Breztri 00:04:40  is twice a day. And since a lot of these patients compliance is very important, it's just so easy to say, ""Take this inhaler, take one puff once a day and be done."""
"Yeah. Kind of standing, my kids summer camp got canceled. So she's in the background and I'm making lunch for her, but-"
"I think the presentation's percentage reduction numbers are pretty impressive, 52, 20, 49. I'm glad they included the number needed to treat because I was wondering on some of that and how significant it actually is, but 80 is not a very high number, so that's good too. I think everything I see here is very believable and paints a good picture of Breztri. I guess, the thought I would have is a lot of it is comparing it to dual therapy. And the big thing is, how does it compare to Trelegy? What's the compelling reason to use it over Trelegy, given the disadvantage of the dosing schedule?"
"And I don't know if Trelegy has similar effects or not, to be honest."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's everything that I knew or believe."
"I could believe it, especially, 49% is a huge number, but then when you look at the depth percentage rate 1.4 to 2.6 and puts a perspective, and makes it more believable."
"Got it, so this is where I'm at a disadvantage. I don't know what Trelegy's numbers are in these metrics, exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality compared to the dual therapies. So there's a big black box. So I have to see what Trelegy does for these. So I don't know how the... And that's what I view Breztri's competitor Trelegy. So I don't know how Breztri would compare to Trelegy without looking up stuff on the latter."
"Maybe I would do it. I'd have to feel it out. So if I have someone who feels great, but then have an exacerbation, I guess, what I've seen here makes me think, should I put him on triple therapy? If I do, how long? Do I keep him on triple therapy for a year of exacerbation free, then knock him back down to dual? Do I just leave him on triple? So it's giving me something to maybe look up on. Should I be putting a different subset of patients on triple therapy. Anyone who has an exacerbation, do I stick them on triple therapy for X amount of time?"
"I would, probably from up to down, increase urgency... from one to seven, not rank one to three. I would say maybe a five or a six, an increased urgency to treat."
"Motivates me to prescribe Breztri, I would say four. And then the last one, I'd say a one just because it doesn't compare it directly to, as we said, Trelegy."
"Seven is always tough because it's... I always have a very difficult time giving the highest number to anything I come across in medicine, because it's all shades of grey. So right or wrong right off the bat, a six would've been the highest I could have given anything. And I would give it a five out of six because I'd have to look into it more. It's always very difficult for me to make a decision on hearing the drug rep pitch, which is what you had described this as. So to me, a five actually sounded pretty good where it definitely made me curious enough to look and see, should I change my prescribing habits? Which, to me, is a big deal of changing an ingrained practice I have."
"And I got four, motivates me to prescribe Breztri. I made it just a little bit less than five because that segues into the last bit. I have to figure out, well, does Trelegy have the same benefit or is it definitely Breztri alone that does this? That's why I gave that a little lower number. And then, the last one just because I still don't know if this is a Breztri specific benefit or does Trelegy have it."
"So again, it compares Breztri to the two dual therapies on there and it's describing mortality, but I'm trying to look at the graphs to see what exactly it's telling me."
"Cumulative incident. So this looks like all close mortality over 52 weeks over a year of... What's the patient population we're looking at? Got it. So I'm assuming this is just all commerce, all severity levels. You start them at time zero, you treat them with Breztri, LAMA/LABA or ICS. It looks like overall, the mortality rates of what you would expect, it looks like about a 2% for LAMA/LABA, a little lower for ICS if I'm reading the graphs correctly, which is odd."
"And then Breztri, which is the lowest. So you can decrease it from a two point something percent down to 1.2%, which, it fits with that 49% reduction. So it does tell you that you take a mortality rate that is low, but not insignificant and makes it better with Breztri."
"Yep. So this is telling you the same thing in summary format. And I forgot to mention, I did like the number needed to treat, which was useful because 80 patients is not a high number. So the best tell you that you can get your benefit out of Breztri quickly."
"Just look at Breztri, it does tell you that, especially since the toxicities of all these things are pretty low. I guess, the question I have then, well, no, I guess it's answered here. Breztri has those good benefits after exacerbation, but I guess, this slide right here is telling you that you shouldn't really bother with a dual therapy by going to triple therapy, you can get a benefit for your patient right away."
"I always have a tough time understanding Kaplan-Meier curves, but..."
"No, I like the other one better. To me it's easier to wrap my head around."
"To tell you the truth, I have to look up Kaplan-Meier curve every time I see it and how to interpret it."
"The top line, I'm not a sentimental, so that doesn't move me much. In the bottom, again, I think, obviously I don't have a huge stats background since I have to look up Kaplan-Meier every time, but there's certain statistics that most MDs know and number needed treat this one that's pretty ubiquitous. So no matter how you phrase the bottom one, I think most docs will get the right idea out of it. The top line is going to be, it'll move some docs I think, and won't move others and I'm probably in the latter category."
"""Comparison mortality across single inhaler."" Sorry. I'm just reading all this, taking it in."
"So I think I've wrapped my head around it. So the first three graphs are just giving you the all calls mortality, and the next is just a cardio protective benefit of these inhalers, I think."
"I'm not sure. It's giving you, again, that 1.2 absolute, I guess, the big takeaway is the ethos result of... I get it. So maybe you can try this, maybe connects it to Trelegy a little bit since impact is looking at Trelegy. So, you're cheating a little bit and you're not comparing Breztri directly to Trelegy, but if you look at each of those compared to LAMA/LABA, you get a better benefit out of Breztri. But what that means, I'm not sure. That extra 0.4% mortality benefit, if it's true and you can cross compare it or not. So I guess, the way I take it is that this does suggest or might be a benefit to Breztri over Trelegy."
"The second one. Definitely, no. Can you put the original back up real quick?"
"Okay. I'm ready to look at the other two. I think  Alt MC 00:22:19  definitely, no. And I think  Alt MB 00:22:22  is equivalent. It seems to have the same information as the original, without the graph. I don't know if some people will find the graph confusing or not. I liked it."
"So, gosh. I view the original and Alt MB as pretty equivalent, so I'd give them both a number... They're all pretty equivalent in what they do here. It's just how easy it is to extract the information from it."
"I'd want the original, so I'd say one, then Alt MB, then Alt MC."
"It wouldn't, I'd probably do it all the same. Because I think they convey the same information as just how  inaudible 00:23:27  to extract."
"I think this is a pretty well laid out slide. It's not very exciting and that doesn't have fancy graphics or terms, but it's a pretty logical way to present information that tells you if you have an exacerbation rate, these are the bad things that can happen."
"In general, I like the first slide better, but I don't recall getting 0.2 from the first slide of 50% of exacerbations go unreported. So I think that's the main interesting thing about this slide, but otherwise I liked the first slide better."
I like this slide actually. I think it's laid out well and it's pretty easy to get the information and I think it conveys all the information of the first slide in a easy to take in package.
"As a standalone slide, it doesn't tell you much but if you were able to shrink this graphic and stick it on one of the other slides, I can see it being, again, it does add a ton. No, but it's neat little graphic that hides everything together."
I like the specifics the other ones give you rather than a general up and down.
"I would say, it does add something  Alt UB 00:26:36 , because it give you that 50% exacerbations unreported. But overall, I like the improvement better. I like the original better."
I like that better than the original. I thought it gives different information just to me an easier... it internalized quicker in my brain.
I think sadly Alt UD gets forth out of all of them.
"And I think maybe four motivates me to prescribe Breztri, I'd say Alt UB would be number one."
"Original would be number two and Alt DC would be three. ""Differentiates from other triple therapies."" I don't know of any of them. I don't think I recall gleaning from any of those slides, whether it tells me whether to use Breztri or Trelegy. So that's a tough one. I don't know if I can only answer that well."
"If I had to pick, I would say Alt DC is number one. And then, I'd say Alt UB two and original three. The fact that numbers are shifted up a little bit, that was the answer I gave for differentiate from other triple therapies, and then one into motivates me to prescribe Breztri."
"No problem.   00:28:39 . Sorry, I'm just going in random order."
"And then, that motivates me to prescribe  inaudible 00:28:45 ."
"So it's using the moderate exacerbation rate as the marker we're looking and I think it's a... Well, I guess, it doesn't tell you what the unit is. So LAMA/LABA has a 0.95 maybe percentage, but it does show that Breztri, especially compared to LAMA/LABA has a better reduction in exacerbations, which is pretty significant because most people nowadays are doing LAMA/LABA instead of ICS/LABA. So an exacerbation rate has a good decrease."
"Because it seems like the main point is they're trying to talk about Breztri versus LAMA/LABA since that's a more market difference. And the first slide, since it has the graphic for ICS/LABA also, I think it confuses the picture a little bit, where it just goes straight there and you have the 52% and it lets you know the LAMA/LABA comparison is where the meat is."
"And you have the ICS/LABA there too, but it's put off to the sides to tell the viewer, pay less attention to this."
"I like this one. I didn't realize the number neater treat was three. I guess, I didn't do the mental mats in my head, but this is nice to have that right there for you. I put that in perspective if it's a pretty low number."
"Gosh, I think I'm not original to come up with my own, but of the three slides, I like the third one the best by far."
"I think, again, it doesn't have the ICS/LABA graph there, which I think confuses the picture that just puts the message right in your face. And I like having the three, the number needed to treat explicitly spelled out for you because it's a really low number. Makes it pretty obvious you'll get a benefit in your patient population pretty quickly."
I think both the improvement over the original.
" Alt DA 00:32:46  number two and original three. And I think I did the same for, ""Motivates me to prescribe Breztri."""
"And again, just because I have such a tough time with the differentiates from other closed triple therapies. I'd probably give them the same answer just because I like the slides in that order."
"You can reduce the hospitalization rate, but the 16% and 20% sound good. It doesn't tell you whether... It tells you that the 16% is not significant. It doesn't tell you if 20 is significant or not, because it's pretty small numbers, 13% versus 15 versus the absolute percentages are all pretty small. So I don't know if they're going to be significant or not."
"I know you got the P value in there, but the P value is just telling you if you're seeing a relationship between the two and not how significant it is when you look at the lines."
"All right. I guess. All right. So versus ICS/LABA 20%. And what is this on the right telling us? Both duals. Anyway... Okay. So the thing of the last is straightforward. I can't quite tell it's a thing of the right is telling us because it says the Y-axis is exacerbations, but then it's talking about hospitalization. So I find the graph on the right a little confusing."
"Got it. So then it's a little confusing, but then it sounds like with that they're using severe exacerbations and hospitalizations interchangeably. Okay. So then it's telling you there is a benefit from Breztri versus both duals."
"I like this one for reasons I've stuck on other slides, it gives you that number needed to treat and it focuses on the meat of the message, which is ICS/LABA."
"So that's a pretty impressive number. The 64%, the 0.047 versus 0.131. So, this is a pretty easy to understand slides, it's comparing two different trials, but it gives you good numbers to look at for breast three."
"It's nice to see it across different trials. It always makes you wonder if you're just looking at it as whether I should do it, why do they quote two different trials? Why not give this information from the same trial?"
But it's not unbelievable. I would for sure believe it.
" Alt HB 00:38:30 , no, because it's adding in a different variable, but there is different trial that all the original did not and  Alt HC 00:38:37 . No. Also, it confused me on that right side."
"I've done for sure. Yeah, I think it added something."
"Increase urgency to treat, I would say ALT HA number one. Then I'd probably say Alt HB number two, Alt HC number three and original four. Motivates me to prescribe, I would probably say the same order. And differentiate from other closed triple therapy, I'd switch over on just a little bit. I'd say Alt HB number one. Alt HC number two, HA number three and original four."
I like this point. It does part in one of the earlier slides that 50% of exacerbations were not reported.
So I'm trying to wrap my head around the graph on the right.
"Okay. They're all on the right side of the rate ratio. Again, since my stats knowledge fails me, I'm not sure what I'm looking at. The graph on the right."
It does just because it tells me with the numbers what I'm seeing.
"So it definitely helps seeing what that means, the graph on the right. So there's a 52% relative risk reduction and so forth with those. So it is helpful. It would be good if they just took it one step further and put the number needed to treat instead of making me do the math, but I like that they put the arrows there. It helps."
"I think so. I think that's a good point that even if you don't have a reported exacerbations, you have these patients who will still benefit from the effect of Breztri, even if they seemingly don't have exacerbations. So I think it's a good message to give."
"It could be because then this is the thing that makes me wonder, should I be doing breast Breztri instead of Trelegy and make patients go through the little bit more hoops of a different dosing schedule."
"So my alternatives are down below, right?"
"All right. I think based on the first slide it is talking about a patient who's definitely exacerbated as the warning sign, but I've changed it to now. It's not just reported exacerbation. It's pretty much anyone because you can have these silent exacerbators. The second slide doesn't change the overall story a whole lot. It just tells you're going to get a benefit in your patient population quickly from prescribed inhaler since includes the number needed to treat."
Original age. Could you slide it over just a little bit so I can see the whole-
"The third set of the third column, I guess. Original H it's kind of cut off on mine."
"Same thing. It doesn't change the story. It just makes it more easier to wrap your head around, but including the number needed to treat."
It looks like original  inaudible 00:45:44  is the same   00:45:46  for both.
"It definitely changes. I think from just people who have had an exacerbation, you should think about Breztri to really old colors, because you can have these silent exacerbators who would benefit from it. So I think it vastly changes the patient you should think about to do Breztri."
"No, not glossed over, but again, I think me and most just really want it fall out to us. How does this compare to Trelegy? I don't know if that'll ever be done because it's never done in pharm therapy directly comparing. It's always non-inferior but I think that's... It'd be nice if that was able to be done."
"No, I didn't get an email with the link, and the initial email didn't have a phone number to call that I see here."
Yeah. I got an email saying to expect an email with a link and I just never got it.
"Sure. And I spoke to them as well, so they're aware."
"Yeah. I'm a staff cardiologist taking, care of patients with cardiovascular disease."
"Yeah. I work in an urban area, in a large hospital, and take care of a range of different cardiovascular diseases."
"Sure. So patient demographics are a mix of low income, rural and privately insured patients, I take care of patients in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. And cardiovascular conditions include myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and then see and evaluate new patients with range of conditions, including palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, those types of things."
"Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, concomitant lung disease is something we see too."
"Well, it's hard to say which one's most concerning, it depends on the particular patient. It depends on what is most uncontrolled for that individual patient."
"Well, diabetes is certainly emerging as an area in cardiovascular medicine that we're primarily focusing on. So currently we have new medications that can improve outcomes for patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, those are typically like SGLT2 inhibitors, and so I'm prescribing those more frequently. But I would say in terms of their blood sugar control, and hemoglobin A1C, and other microvascular complications of diabetes, that, in my practice, still lands with the primary care physician."
"Yeah. So for example, if I'm seeing a patient with congestive heart failure and they also have diabetes, I will see them, if I note their diabetes is... I note the presence of diabetes, I might identify a therapeutic that because they're diabetic, they might benefit from being on from a cardiovascular perspective and prescribe that medication, counsel the patient on heart healthy lifestyle factors, trying to optimize them from a cardiovascular lens. But of course diabetes has multiorgan effects, and so I'm really just focusing on the cardiovascular aspect of it."
"Non cardiovascular comorbidities. Well, I guess comorbidities in general, ownership of hypertension, I would consider that a cardiovascular comorbidity, I'd have ownership of that, hyperlipidemia would be the same. Those are probably the two comorbidities that I would say we take most of ownership of in cardiology."
"Well, typically a patient seen in cardiology clinic, we'll start with an EKG in addition to physical exam. So physical exam focusing on listening to the heart and lungs, evaluating for elevated filling pressures, evidence of swelling, and based on that can narrow our differential. Obviously in cardiology, two of the things that come to mind often are congestive heart failure or potentially an  inaudible 00:11:46  with equivalent with shortness of breath. So history, physical exam, EKG are really the starting points, and then depending on what that shows usually proceeds to additional testing often, including blood work and an echocardiogram."
"Well, I think given the fact they're in cardiology clinic, of course cardiac causes are probably on the forefront of what we're looking at, but of course the overlap between respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease is there. And so if signs don't point to it being cardiovascular nature, then certainly we consider respiratory etiology as well."
"Usually we'll get our pulmonary colleagues involved. Maybe we'll try expedite by getting things like pulmonary function to... Or go ahead and ordering pulmonary function tests. But usually, if the etiology appears most consistent with respiratory we'll get pulmonary involved."
"So if their physical exam isn't consistent with congestive heart failure, there's no elevated filling pressures or swelling, symptoms aren't really consistent with it. And then if blood tests like a BNP is within normal limits, the echo is within normal limits, those would be things that would be less likely to point towards something like congestive heart failure and make us look in the direction of potentially pulmonary causes."
"Yeah. In terms of trying to identify a pulmonary cause. I think a big help there, when the pulmonologist sees the patient, is that the cardiac workup is complete and thorough. Because on their end they're probably needing to consider cardiovascular causes too, so I think it helps them a lot knowing that the heart disease has been has been evaluated thorough."
"I suppose I'm considering it in patients that have known respiratory disease and known cardiovascular disease and they're having worsening symptoms, and trying to tease out what is the primary culprit of their symptoms. That would be the scenario that comes to my mind as most commonly considering that."
"You know, sometimes we'll communicate with their pulmonologist and make sure they're optimized from a COPD standpoint, or if they think there's more that can be done to optimize the COPD, of course from a cardiology standpoint, looking at their volume status and filling pressures and trying to make sure they're optimized from a cardiovascular standpoint. A lot of times, or occasionally for these patients, they need invasive hemodynamics to better characterize their filling pressure. So a right heart catheterization may be needed."
"Either pulmonary, if it's a more advanced form of COPD pulmonary is often involved, or internal medicine or the primary care doctor."
"The things that come to my mind if I'm dealing with a patient with pulmonary disease, is occasional only the use of beta blockers may need to be considered. In terms of other medications, antiplatelet agents, ticagrelor for example, may have an adverse effect of shortness of breath, it can muddy the picture so that's something that may need be considered. Those are the things that come to my mind from a treatment perspective."
"I would say I don't personally... I'm not the primary on their COPD regimen, in terms of their inhaler regimen and that sort of thing, that's not my area of expertise, but I am comfortable managing their cardiovascular disease when they have that existing comorbidity."
"As internal medicine training would take care of patients with COPD, and prescribe medications for that."
"I would say it depends on what their... It certainly is an increased risk for them just having adverse clinical outcomes. So for example, if the patient has both congestive heart failure and COPD, I am concerned that patient is it higher risk of hospitalization or other adverse outcomes. And not only because they're dealing with heart failure, but they also have COPD."
"I don't think it changes how I manage their cardiovascular conditioning, because I'll still try to optimize that and manage it as closely as possible, but perhaps just making sure they have good close follow up and a good care plan for their COPD, in addition to what I'm doing."
"Look and make sure they have followup appointments scheduled, there's recent notes that outline the care plan, that sort of thing."
"Talk to the patient about it, I suppose too."
"Yeah, absolutely. I think one, from a patient functional status and symptom standpoint they're certainly related and might combine and make a patient feel worse, or make it more cult to understand whats the leading ideology of why a patient isn't doing as well. I think from a physiologic standpoint, one of the things we probably see most commonly is patients with pulmonary hypertension related to underlying lung disease. And so that's probably the most clear example of where there's a physiologic relation between the two."
"Yeah, I do. I would think that well managed COPD in the setting of cardiovascular disease, back to the example I gave of pulmonary hypertension, one of the main stays of treatment is trying to improve the underlying lung disease as best as possible so that helps the underlying pulmonary vascular pressures and reduces hypoxia, and that sort of thing."
"Yeah. I think probably all, in my mind, circles together and that if their cardiovascular disease is well managed, that's going to help their underlying lung function from a cardiopulmonary standpoint, that might improve their functional capacity, allow them to be more functional access, more lung capacity, that sort of thing. So I think it works together."
"Yeah, I could think of examples where patients have both congestive heart failure and COPD, and if their congestive heart failure is not well managed, they have increased filling pressures on the left side that exacerbates shortness of breath, that then contributes to the downward spiral where their COPD is flaring up more. So I can certainly think of examples where uncontrolled heart failure is going to worsen the COPD situation."
"Yeah. And vice versa, where if their COPD is uncontrolled, thinking back to what's required to get control of COPD, so patient comes in with acute COPD exacerbation, they're going to likely require high doses of steroids, inhaled breathing treatments, all of these type of treatment. Modalities aren't necessarily favorable if the patient also has underlying cardiovascular disease. So it's not ideal."
"I think, as I look at the bar graphs, there's definitely variability across each study. I think the main point is that respiratory related causes of death is not usually the main driver, although there's two studies in which it is the main driver. And so the point seems to be that cancer related and cardiac related deaths are something that is an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COPD."
I guess my first reaction is not surprised. That's something that's consistent with my understanding of this patient population.
"No, I wouldn't say it does. I think that's pretty consistent with what I would think about when I think about COPD patients."
"So I'm just processing these bottom two columns, COPD alone, CV condition alone. So main takeaway is that having both COPD and the cardiovascular condition, ischemic heart disease or heart failure, patients do worse if they have both compared to one or the other."
"This fits with my current knowledge. I do note that obviously, or based on the data presented here, that it looks like versus COPD alone, adding heart disease in the mix you get higher risk of mortality, compared to adding COPD into the cardiovascular condition."
No. No. This would be consistent with my impression.
"The acute short term risk of myocardial infarction and stroke after COPD exacerbation are elevated. And that is data that I'm not as familiar with, so would say that is somewhat new information. I could understand that a patient, after any acute health event, I wonder if you'd have the same data for pneumonia or something else. Any acute health event, their risk of acute cardiovascular event goes up."
"That it's a... Patients with COPD after an acute event, are a vulnerable group for adverse cardiac vascular outcomes."
"I think again, just keeping in mind these patients are vulnerable after an acute event, and need to be monitored for these conditions, like MI and stroke."
"Yeah. I don't really know what that means, if moderate means requiring hospitalization or moderate means requiring IV steroids or supplemental oxygen, so that's probably my main thing, is not knowing exactly what is meant by moderate."
So it did have a indicator that I could look at the bottom.
"No, I think that's probably what I would think moderate would've meant. I suppose it... A question that comes to mind is, does that exclusive exacerbations, what does the data look like for severe exacerbations, why just moderate? Or is it moderate and greater, or what that might be?"
"Intuitively it would be higher, but maybe there's competing risk there, where severe exacerbations   00:32:16  Sorry, I was hearing an echo when I'm talking there. Okay."
"Yeah so intuitively, the data would be worse."
"Again.   00:32:45  Yeah, I think it just goes back to, a patient with COPD who's not doing well is at acutely increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. So that's important information."
"Product X had a significant reduction in all-cause mortality, versus the long acting muscarinic antagonist and long acting beta agonist. Any reduction and all-cause mortality to that degree over a 52 month period is certainly notable and definitely an improvement in outcomes for the patients who received that product."
"To me, all-cause mortality of course, is the ultimate endpoint, and so the data are very compelling. To me it looks like product X basically added an inhaled corticosteroid to the LAMA and LABA. So something about adding that inhaled corticosteroid was certainly beneficial to these patients."
"Well, it seems that this... Not having expert knowledge of the current treatment modalities available for COPD, superficially, seeing this would seem that it would be a welcomed addition to the treatment modalities available to these patients."
"So when looking at the primary results in subgroup analysis, it appears that cardiovascular causes of mortality are really the main driver behind the results of reduced all-cause mortality for product X. This sorts it out, where apparently there was also an arm with inhaled corticosteroid steroid and long-acting beta agonist that had somewhat similar outcomes. So I don't think on the previous side... Maybe I did, maybe there was. Yeah, the previous slide did have that arm, but it looks like they had comparable in terms of cardiovascular event. So that, again, points to this inhaled corticosteroid being the main difference."
"It makes me... I'm speculating here, but what comes to my mind is the is being inhaled corticosteroid reducing inflammation that's leading to lower cardiovascular events. That's the first thought that comes to my mind."
Maybe these patients are obviously at an increased... I would imagine they have an increased baseline inflammatory level and there's some benefit to reducing that.
"The overall numbers of respiratory deaths are just low, and so it's just going to be hard to detect a... And it goes back to the data you showed earlier where... That's not what these patients are dying of. Typically, they're most commonly dying of cancer or cardiovascular disease, so it's just going to be hard to demonstrate a difference in respiratory death when the etiology for death is infrequently related to that."
Yeah. And maybe there's just not a meaningful difference in the products.
"Yeah. So confirm MACE, MACE is composite cardiovascular outcomes. Higher percent of patients there, you see that MACE is higher with LAMA/LABA, versus product X and ICS/LABA. Notably product X is a little bit higher than just the ICS/LABA arm. Then you dig in further to nonfatal MI, non fatal stroke and cardiovascular death. And looking directly at cardiovascular death, the product X and ICS/LAMA or ICS/LABA are equivalent there."
"No, not really. I think it's... No. It does make me wonder, again I don't have a lot of experience with COPD treatment regimens, but is there already something available that is ICS/LABA and you seem to get same outcomes as product X, which may be a new, more expensive product."
"Yeah. And I think maybe more so it's that, LABA/LAMA should not be the standard of care in these patients, and that adding an inhaled corticosteroid into whatever the patient is receiving is beneficial in whatever way you do that."
"I think you're just adding that subgroup information and showing that the curve is driven by cardiovascular deaths predominantly. So when I just look at all-cause mortality in a condition like COPD, you do wonder, are we talking cancer, are we talking cardiovascular, what? And this just highlights that the driving outcome was cardiovascular death."
"It's compelling. Yeah. I think it's compelling. Now that I've seen the other slides, it does make me... Notably absent is the difference between LABA/LAMA and ICS-LABA, if that was an arm in the trial, there's no data there."
"Oh, maybe it is down here. Yeah, nonsignificant reduction in death. Got it. So it is nonsignificant, versus ICS/LABA, so that is stated there at the bottom but I missed it earlier."
"Again, being not on the forefront of cutting edge COPD regimen, it makes me wonder what is standard of care right now. Is LABA/LAMA standard of care, or his ICS-LABA standard of care? And is product X novel and new, what should it be compared to? Those are just questions I have."
"Yeah. I that's important information, because I think it just gives more context to the all-cause mortality data."
"That's exciting. That's good news for patients. Obviously would need to better understand what we just talk about, what are current standards of care and all that sort of thing to give more context to these data. But in theory, in concept, a COPD medication that significantly reduces cardiovascular death is a good thing."
"Yeah. I see the message being displayed here, and it's compelling, and I think just demonstrates that this inhaler for COPD patients provides similar cardiovascular benefits to landmark studies and in the field of cardiology."
"I think it's compelling. It certainly gets my attention, that in a way it's almost similar to the early SGLT2 inhibitor trials where you see these cardiovascular event reduction in a medication that wasn't initially intended for that, and so it's compelling in that way. I would have to think more about, are we comparing apples to apples here? These cardiovascular trials were done in patients with existing cardiovascular disease, but actually one of those might be a primary prevention trial, but anyway, that's just one thing that comes to my mind, is thinking through that. But overall, I think it's compelling and the that absolute risk reduction numbers are comparable to very convincing cardiovascular trials."
"Well SGLT2 inhibitors, I think the one thing been done in that space is they've gone on to do outcomes trials in patients with cardiovascular disease, regardless of whether or not they had diabetes. And so as those trials have come out there's certainly been increased uptake of the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for our patients."
"I think the information presented today has highlighted the link between, to me... I'm not surprised that most patients with COPD have a high mortality risk related to cardiovascular disease, I do think new pieces of information are the acute risk in patients with COPD exacerbations. And then the potential for a medication aimed at COPD, an inhaler, it's compelling that an inhaler can have such convincing outcomes with regard to cardiovascular outcomes. So that's new information, and I don't think something that is thought about or talked a lot about in the field of cardiology."
"Initially, my reaction is that I would see myself being hesitant to prescribe an inhaler, just because that's not a modality of treatment I typically prescribe, and it's usually within the realm of pulmonary to do that. But I might also would've said, several years ago, the same thing about diabetes medications or injectable cholesterol medications. So I do acknowledge that that could change, but initially my thought would be that that would probably still be in the realm of pulmonary to identify and establish standards of care for improving outcomes for patients with COPD."
"Yeah. If I'm seeing a patient and I know a product like this is available, I presume my pulmonary colleagues would also know a product like this was available. I would see initially just bringing up that conversation about... I would probably, in a way, defer to them on, ""Is this the way we're going in treatment of COPD? What do you think about these data?"" They're interesting to us from cardiology perspective to would want their perspective too."
"Yeah. Again, if the standard of care is LAMA/LABA, and we know that patients with COPD have high rates of cardiovascular events, and we have a new therapy that can reduce at risk of cardiovascular events, that certainly would meet an unmet need."
"Yeah. My specialty is in pulmonary medicine. And my office is located in a suburban area, actually in the State of New Jersey. The practice has been around for many years, over 25 years. I've been involved in, most of those years in the practice, about 22, 23."
"Yeah, it's a single-specialty small group, and we serve the community in the area. We're not academically a facility. However, we practice the kind of medicine where... We're located about maybe less an hour away from two major academic cities  inaudible 00:04:55  and there's high expectations. With the  inaudible 00:05:00  business, people can go and get the best care in the most available and most up to date treatments and diagnostics available."
"So we have to stand up to those levels. And I'm proud to say we do, we meet with key levels all the time. We're early adopters, so that's better medicine we do. That's it."
"Actually, maybe about, you mean altogether or on a monthly basis or how many do   00:05:46  practice?"
"In a month time, in a month time about maybe 180, maybe 200."
"Yeah. So by virtue of my specialty, a lot of times I don't, maybe I don't see many of the mild COPD. A lot of those sometimes are treated by their primary care physician in their..."
"So, when the COPD come to me most of the time, he's already at a moderate level. Not that I don't see mild but I do see milds too, but those are usually a lot of times, a lot of them are self-referred or they come in because they do feel symptoms. They want to see pulmonologist right away. But when they come to me already at a stage two, three, or four, lets assumes more advanced, first thing I do is make sure I assess... I take them in, I take it very detailed."
"My first visit is always a very detailed history, just make sure that we narrow down the symptoms and whatever the patient is going through to try to classify the patient, according to the severity, try to elicit every comorbidities existence, and try to eliminate other possibilities that there may be other causes for their symptom, which is very common in patients with COPD. And then from that point I, of course I establish a set of diagnostic, which is really part of the assessment of how severe the patient is. Get whatever is necessary what is next way, long screening CT scan, of course, pulmonary function testing. And then last underline is establishing, tailoring a treatment protocol for the..."
"So, like I said the first thing we establish is, the treatment is mainly dependent on, I would say two factors: where the stage of the COPD is, according to GOLD and then the comorbidities are a very important factor in determining what kind of treatment the patient is going to..."
"Well, when I talk about comorbidity, the main factor is essentially... I mean, there are other ones that are important obviously, but the main one is going to be cardiovascular disease. You're talking cardiovascular disease, and also to some extent obstructive sleep apnea which I like to take care of, but it's the cardiovascular disease is the most important. And I tell you how that plays a role at this point. The first recommendation, I guess, would be to start psychotherapy after one if a COPD comes in a mother or whatever comes into you either they have one, ER visit exacerbation or two outpatient exacerbations, I guess that's what we follow in mind."
"But that's... I... We have, I mean, I guess anyway, maybe not to sound pretentious, but some experience sometimes allows you to maybe think outside the box a little bit. So yeah, that's good if you're following a cookbook, but I'm not just going to probably wait for that second exacerbation to happen before I start someone on a triple therapy, that's kind of silly. I'll give you an example. If somebody has already has Coronary artery disease, already had like a stent placed or established Coronary artery disease continues to smoke, or has AFib or any issues like this, I'm just not going to wait for that second."
"As a matter of fact, sometimes I don't even wait for the first exacerbation to initiate triple therapy. Some patients are just can't wait for triple therapy because that's an established fact. It has... It reduces mortality mostly from cardiovascular causes, and it reduces rate of exacerbations the way I approach my COPD patient is that I see it as a battle, as an ongoing battle with COPD with the patient and myself on one side, COPD on the other, right? The minute you get one exacerbation, it's already one battle. We lost that first exacerbation is the last battle that should not happen. That definitely should not happen."
"Yeah. So I try to prevent... The goal is to try to prevent exacerbation, because with every exacerbation you're increasing the risk for heart disease, including cardio infection, more cardiovascular problems in the future, reduction in their lung function. So why should we wait for that? So if we have a patient that has already a set up for a moderate that is bound to get worse  inaudible 00:12:10  therapy, otherwise I may stick more rigidly to those rules."
"You know, it depends on the companies I guess. Some of... They don't... Of course they try to some, maybe some companies try to make their product stand up, per se, as being the good product or the best product or associated with less mortality and whatever else it's all in the way you present it. But the bottom line is it's really, it's more of a triple therapy. It's kind of a classic recommendation regardless of the product, the partner, or what is you using the combination of product or fix those products? It's the triple therapy concept that is important more so than the fact that all three come in one device or whether one device is better than the other. Now that's the concept to me as a treatment pulmonologist. So the concept is having is that psychotherapy is the best therapy for these therapies of patients moderate, severe, regardless of what the product is, that's how I look at it."
"Are they talking about device? Of course they are. I mean, they are talking about devices, they're talking about best ways to deliver that triple therapy to patients. So they try to emphasize a point, which is very valid. And I do agree with it. So there's two products right now, right? So they try to emphasize a point, which is valid, which is the fact that if the patient needs to receive the triple therapy it would be much easier for the patient to just use one device, to get all, any medications in one device, which is definitely a valid point. Right?"
"And at that point it becomes between the two products, one being the DPI, one being an MDI, the point becomes now at that point the point of contention, I guess, if you want to point it becomes, which is a better device for delivery."
"And each one will try to make the point about maybe their device being a better device than the other. And the truth is no one is a hundred percent, right? No one is a hundred percent your own. There are definitely some good points to each one of the two products that are available on the market. And there's no doubt about it that each one of them tried to make... Try to push for those important points to make their products look like a better choice."
Do I have any hesitation? Is this what you asked me? I'm sorry maybe I didn't hear you all.
"No, I don't do we have the ideal product out there? I'm not sure. Maybe, maybe not. Hold on a second."
"In terms of fixed, I think fixed-dose therapy is a better way to go than... In general, Okay? In general is a better way to go than a mixing of different devices and different doses."
"For one main reason, which is as regardless of the products, all the companies can advertise whatever product they want. The bottom line with me as a healthcare provider, is the single most important factor in determining... In making a choice for that patient that you need to start on treatment, and that factor is called compliance. You have to make sure that you are going to... You have to make the choice as conducive as possible to that factor called compliance. Because at the end of the day, you can do what you can, whatever product you want, and you think this is the person, this is whatever, this is the ultimate. If the patient is not using it who cares? It's really doesn't matter at this point. So, you have to choose your product that you, as a clinician, knowing the patient that you're treating, you have a feeling that this product is going to be the best choice for the best compliance with this particular patient."
"My overall view... I mean, that's a very accurate depiction of what COPD is. I like it, I like the setup, it's clear, it gives the most important tragic points about COPD and most importantly, it puts it in the right perspective in terms of, I like the fact that they put it as a third leading code by itself, separately at the bottom in a way that sends out more than any... Than all the other points."
"No, I mean, I'm kind of pretty much familiar... The very aware of the readmission rate, not surprised about the fact the only, maybe surprising factor is that over half patient with COPD undiagnosed. It's not... It is both surprising and not surprising, I guess in a way that the most of the diagnosis unfortunately still takes place at the primary care physician level. And a lot of time, if you're saying undiagnosed, it means equivalent to that term is delayed diagnosis, which means that it has been, undiagnosed for many years. Right? And there is a lot of delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment for that matter. So, I never put a number to it, but over half being undiagnosed is definitely a very impressive number."
"Motivating me to think differently than the way I think now already. I mean, maybe not really. I mean, it's, I would say four."
"And that's exactly, I put it on purpose in middle of the road, because it's not a critique to the slide itself. It's really, again, you made a point about being relevant to my practice. In terms of my practice, the reason why it does not make any change is because I'm mostly aware of this, so it's not going to make me, oh my God, I never did this before, now I'm going to start doing it this way. So, I am really mostly aware, however, this definitely it's a very strong, and it could be extremely relevant maybe to different kinds of practices. Again, like I said, especially internist, so it's an extremely impactful slide, I really like it and it could be extremely relevant to different practices. Yes."
"Yeah, it's interesting looking at the world map, I mean obviously the comorbidities that are listed there, I guess I'm starting from the bottom, from the end, rather high BMI, hypertension, increased blood glucose, raised cholesterol, low physical activity. These are the comorbidities that are always looked for that can make your COPD presentation. Whether it makes COPD worse or it is associated with higher incidents with patients with COPD either way, it's always there. I mean, it's very commonly there and I always look for them in my initial assessment of the patient. Going back up exposure, pollution, smoking and occupational is again one of the main, most important things that we look at, but going back to the map itself it's very interesting how you see the population of the world being affected differently. And there are some definitely very surprising areas there that I was looking at that I'm, that I was wondering why is that the case?"
"Some area, as you can tell like for example, you take Mexico, Central America. I'm not sure about the level of pollution there. We not hear of it being that high of course in Mexico City maybe, but the other sides of it maybe it's associated mostly with smoking is this maybe why it is associated with a higher mortality rate? And again, I'm assuming this is Greenland, I think was a very high mortality rate in Alaska. So it's these are certain areas that are a little surprising in terms of why the mortality rate is that high. The other thing that is surprising is Russia being so low again, I wonder whether this is an underdiagnosed area, which falls in that initial category that we talk about. So, these are just some things that kind of stand out, but..."
"Very much so. I mean, it would be extremely interesting to try to delineate those factors."
"So the... This... If the point of the slide is to bring out the low, the association of low social or economic status with COPD, I'm assuming that those areas with the highest prevalence are the ones that have the highest, I mean, the lowest social economic status."
"Which I guess it is, I mean, again those same area... I mean, I can understand Mexico or Central America or South America, most of Africa being affected by this, of course, obviously the Indian continent."
"I guess I give it a good maybe a five for sure. Maybe even a six, just because of the importance of bringing out that socioeconomic status to the equation, not just the medical factors that's definitely important."
"Beautiful, it's a beautiful slide. It's really all... It's really the core of what the moderate COPD is all about, is about preventing those exacerbation. Again, the point it's extremely important on that, I love that slide there where they say that 57, 58% of COPD are not even reported. That's why... When that's why, when I had mentioned to you in the past that I'm even tending to everyone that are diagnosed as a moderate, especially if they are on, if they have ongoing you risk factors, continue to smoke, or they have a social cardiovascular disease, even if they didn't have that quote unquote first exacerbation yet who cares? Am I going to wait for that first exacerbation to happen for them to have a decrease in lung function?"
"Plus the fact that it's very important patient may have had an exacerbation before either they forgot about it, or it happened two years ago, or it happened maybe you don't want to count it two years ago at the beginning of the year, and it was already 11 months ago, and they forgot, or it was mild enough they didn't even think of it as an exacerbation that they should report. And some patients tend to minimize their concept. So it's extremely important that the aspect of not reporting this COPD exacerbation and then the impact of those exacerbation on those patients on all those levels, for sure."
I love that down downward spiral that connects everything together.
"You know what I would like? I think it's too many important informations all crossed up on one slide. That's one thing on the side, it deserves a slide on its own, honestly.  00:35:06 "
It's really validates in a lot of ways. It validates the way I've been thinking in terms of being more motivated to treat those patients as early on as possible with triple therapy. With the consideration that up to 78% of exacerbations are not even reported.
"Very busy slide. All right, exacerbations can reduce lung function, yes. And disease progression, correct. Very true. Following exacerbation lung functions may not recover to pre exacerbation levels of course. Weeks, moderate, severe leading to an accelerated lung function decline. Yes. Very true. Extremely evident. Again, it's something that validates... That's one of the points that I try to make to my patients when I try to convince them that they need to change their medication. One of the things that we always face in those patients who are, who feel... Wrongly feel, or they're in denial of some sort that, oh, why should it be, why should I change medication? I've been on this inhaler for years and everything's going well, I only felt short of breath once here and there. But again, this there's a lot of, is some tendency at some point in a lot of patients to minimize their symptoms, or to feel like they don't want to make any change."
"They don't want to rock the boat. And one of... That's one of the fact definitely what I code to them a lot of times is the fact that if you ever get one exacerbation, things would never be the same after that. So it's a very important concept for patients to understand. And then the deterioration from that point becomes again, another downward spiral. So the chance of them getting more exacerbation, according to the slide before becomes even worse. So you just don't want to be... You want to try to prevent that first exacerbation as much as possible."
"It doesn't motivate me to think different, again it's validates. So I'll give it maybe like a five or six."
"The first thing that came out of my mind is that it's a busy slide. I mean so, but the content of it is very simple and very through the point. I'm just suggesting that..."
"I'm not sure. Maybe reduce the amount of disclaimers at the bottom. That kind of makes it a little busier. I mean, I understand for whatever, maybe legal purposes, you have to do it, but maybe you can put it all on a different slide. That's number one, that's all I'm saying is that slide is already busy enough, you don't want to make it more busy. That's number one. Again, number two, maybe I understand the point of putting them side to side, but sometime maybe that's making it a little too complicated. That first slide by itself where you have that lightning bolt right in the middle, it is very impactful."
"And then the other one can the other one, I'm not really getting the... I understand the point is to try to bring out the fact that the mild to moderate are the one who suffered the most from that exacerbation. So I... But it's so is the severe, so it's the only one that seems to be not impacted is the one that's very severe. And that's really cause of the fact that they don't have much to do too much to lose anymore at this point. So, I don't know how relevant that is. And especially with the fact that it takes a little away from the more important slide, which is the first one. So I would say maybe discard it or maybe put it off to another slide."
"Yeah. Very strong statements. I'm not sure if I was aware of the exact numbers in regard to the risk of death. The one I was aware of is the five years at 50%. The 50% at three years over three, I'm not sure I was aware of that. The 80% with two moderate exacerbations with one year. I'm not sure where that came from. So the risk of death was increased by 80% with two moderate exacerbations within one year, which kind of, I'm not sure how you consign that with the other one that says following two exacerbations, 50% are dead within five years. Here we think risk of this was increased by 80% within one year."
"I'm not sure how to consign that. It sounds... There's too many numbers, too many statistics that seem... That you bring, it's very strong, the first two statements I'm not sure which one to believe which one is more credible. Are these two different studies? I'm not sure what is the difference between the two that are at the top there following one or two, and then following more than three, you have those, and then you have the other ones on the side, on the left side that give you different set of numbers. So..."
"I see what you mean. So it's, the 50% is the cumulative in five years. So the risk decreases initially 80%. Okay. Got it."
"No, I don't... So I don't want to put it down it's maybe the way it's presented it's could be a little confusing, but it's all extremely important, extremely relevant. The 80% is extremely impactful and it has to be brought out to the communication between the physician and the patient. So that's... So that these are relevant facts, not just for the physician to know, but also for the patient."
"Yep. Again, very important data, I'm already aware of most of it, and extremely important factor that a lot of physicians and patients like I'm not aware of, especially the cardiovascular community the impact of COPD exacerbation on cardiovascular events. It's pretty much at the same rate as many of the other diseases that cardiologists spend so much time treating and preventing like hyper leukemia or hypertension or other things. So, it's extremely important for cardiologists to be aware of this kind of data. And for me, this is extremely important. That is one of the most unknown effects of COPD exacerbations in general. I would say in my opinion, In one of the most impactful one that needs to be absolutely recognized yesterday before today."
"No, it's kind of clear. I mean, it's... The only thing that I was just noticing is that there's... I guess we're trying to differentiate the combined events of cardiovascular or basically a MI and stroke and the first one on the left side and the one on the right side, it only has the icon of the heart, which really we're intending for say that those statistics here that say it's four time risk, and first days 90% increasing for up to one year, these are only related to... It's the intention seems to be that it's only for heart attacks or MI's."
"So I'm not sure is this the reason why they only put the icon of the heart there rather than icon of the heart and the brain? But then again, underneath it says, CV events consist of CV's, MI's, stroke, angina and transient ischemic attack, which is a brain event. So, is this relevant to the four to the four time risk in the first 30 days? And the 90% increase for up to one year? Is that thing that is listed in the box? Is it more relevant to those two things or is it relevant to the whole slide or together? You understand what I'm trying to say here?"
"It seems that we're trying to differentiate on top by putting one area there where it's two icons, heart and brain, whereas the other one only heart, and then going on to list, whatever here is living is related to both heart and brain on the other side is only what's relevant to the heart, but then we're including in that little box there at the bottom brain even, so I'm not sure. So it creates a little confusion. Is the 90% increase is related to all cardiovascular events, including stroke and my MIs, or is it just for brain or just heart events?"
"Relevance, seven. What's the second one? Credibility is six and motivation is six."
"Motivations makes me think differently, not differently, but more, I wouldn't say more differently, but again, I always use the word same word as validation of what I'm really convinced on to continue doing what you're doing. It's motivation, I guess, to change or to make, bring more awareness to other communities and always remind myself of the importance of that. Sometimes you're used to just focusing on COPD so, and because cardiovascular is part of a different specialty, you feel like sometimes you don't need to adjust that. And it's extremely important that you make that point right from the get go. So, yeah, I'll keep it safe."
"So again, it's a little more detailed, it's not already know about. What you already know about the association of COPD and heart disease. And I'm familiar with a lot of those statistics in terms of the association with heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, maybe not diabetes, but that's, I think is new to me. But again, brings out a very important point about the importance of recognizing that association and addressing it as early as possible."
"No. I mean that, I like that the... Where you have the COPD alone in the middle, and then all the other Associa... I like to set up of that slide. It's very clear and I think themselves, and again, that's a point I have, I brought to myself when I was, when I first became familiarized with that association, whether they bring the association with COPD, ischemic heart disease, that being between 40 and 140%, I just did not understand that range. It's not a very impactful range to present, especially that if you look at the data with COPD alone, which is not mentioned here, but I'm familiar with it's about 30 to 40%, I believe, or 32 to something like that. So there's some overlap in the numbers, which makes that impact of COPD alone compared to COPD with ischemic heart disease, not very clear, and the same goals for COPD and heart failure with COPD alone is also kind of 30 to 40%."
"Whereas the other one is 30 to 90%, but there is the range is so wide that it's hard to make an impact with those numbers being such a right interval. As opposed for example, 56% with COPD and atrial fibrillation is just, it's 56%. It's just one number. And it's very impactful, even though it doesn't reach the 90% that you have with heart failure, but being that it's sets a fixed number with increase the risk even by itself, it makes it more impactful than the range that we have in the other ones."
"The impact on quality of life, increasing dyspnea is again, goes without saying extremely important to bring up all the time. And that's one of the things that you always have to be aware of when the patient comes to you with shortness of breath that you bring up that point. My thing on this is seven, seven, and I'm going to say seven again cause   00:53:29  it's motivating to always bring those points up when I'm initiating my assessment."
Be interesting. That's definitely something I was not aware of.
"It's a statistic. I mean it's not confusing. It's just surprising a little bit. So, patient's with moderate COPD are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than patient's with severe COPD. I guess, percent is..."
"Very interesting point with that thing. I'm not surprised about the mortality, it's something that we keep talking about over and over and over. The high rate of mortality and was probably about 39% is at least even under explanation in, I think in other studies, but it says you're whatever... I'm not maybe I think its I'm thinking maybe of different statistics, 39% is probably right. I'm thinking of what the reduction of mortality by using triple therapy  inaudible 00:55:41 . But anyway, this is interesting, but definitely a new point of view that I was not aware of is the fact that moderates are more likely to  inaudible 00:55:50 . So again brings up more of a point of treating those moderates as early as possible with triple therapy because that's the one that is, has been associated with triple therapy has been essentially associated."
"The benefit of triple therapy is to reduce the events of cardiovascular disease. That's really the bottom line. And so which in view of that slide there brings out the extreme importance of starting those patients with moderate disease on triple therapy, more so than the severe disease, which is not really the general trend that it's going on right now. Most people say, oh, once they become severe, then you can put it on triple therapy. Well now it's too late. So, going back on the ratings is definitely seven, seven, and a good, strong seven on the last in terms of   00:56:42 "
"CV testing events are potentially driven by  inaudible 00:56:53  on the impact of his exacerbations. Okay, hyperinflation hypoxia tachycardia yeah. Of course, that's very important slide, it kind of shows the connection between the two at some level, which is that like little square there with small writing, which I would suggest to make it bigger, bold and brighter because these..."
"Hyperinflation   00:57:47  tachycardia. Right? I think this is really, the missing link or the magic link, rather whatever you want to call it between the... Is it two seemingly separated areas? Like a lot of times you wonder what is actually, why is the COPD exacerbation causing an increase risk in cardiovascular events? It's important to recognize those factors. They are... These are the driving factors that lead to those cardiovascular events. So they extremely important to bring forth. And that will help you understand why treating the COPD, whether it is a perceived exacerbation or not whether the patient is relating in exacerbation or not. It's extremely important to prevent those things from happening. Because again, it's about prevention. Once the tachycardia happens and the cardiovascular event happens, it's too late, already at that point. So it's all about prevention."
"Seven, seven, yeah. And again, seven it's always pointing out. Maybe I'm not changing anything, but it's motivating me to do more in terms of bringing force that bringing out that risk of cardiovascular disease among patients in the community and everyone else. So three sevens."
"Patient counts, not on ICS, of course, very important point. That last one seems to be a little bit at odds with the other ones, but it's extremely important to recognize that's something that I do as part of all my COPD patients to try to identify a subset of people who may have for all that matters right now. There's no other denomination that we use, but eventually in the future, I'm sure there's going to be a specific denomination for those patients with COPD with high eosinophil count. Right now, we're calling ACO, right? As my COPD overlap, whatever, but it's for lack of better than the denomination I try to identify those patients right from the get go, even though they don't present as asthmatic we get a cell count to try to identify whether they have a high eosinophil count or not."
"And for some of those patients, they may be candidates if they have a high eosinophil count. And I classify them as ACO I try to initiate them on maybe biologic treatment. If I feel that this is something that they may benefit from, especially if they've been, if they have potential of being steroid dependent, or if they're symptoms are otherwise not well controlled. So it's extremely important point to bring forth relating, regarding those patients with high eosinophils, but the least you can start with is make sure that you put them on ICS, but again, am I just restricting the inhaled corticosteroid to those patients? Absolutely not. It's important to identify the eosinophils, but not so much. I disagree with the fact that those are the ones that need to be put on ICS as opposed to other ones maybe do not need that. That's not the concept that I want to be understood from that slide."
"It almost puts on exclusivity or maybe a more important point to put those patients who have a high eosinophil count on ICS, but most patients who are already at moderate with one exacerbation, regardless of what their eosinophil count need to be on ICS or that's part of triple therapy. So, I'm not sure about where that stands. I think to me, the more important point about the people who have a high eosinophil count is the fact that they may be at the clinicians discussions, they may be candidate for more therapy that may be traditionally directed towards asthma. Like I said, with the use of biologics and stuff like that. But again, very important, best predictor of future exacerbation. It goes without saying increased breathlessness is with higher exacerbation risk. Again, very important, very known points."
Same point that was brought up in the slide before the interval becomes shorter and the severity becomes more severe. Relevance is seven. The second one is also seven. Change or motivation to change maybe more at five. I'm not sure if this is maybe have a strong impact on me changing my treatment.
"Patients with increased breathlessness at higher risk of exacerbation. Again, same point that was brought up before in two slides in that sequence, very known that breathlessness sometimes we call it exacerbation or not well controlled. Whatever name is going to be is given to that breathlessness sensation, but we treat it or I consider it a poorly controlled COPD. That's what I call it anyway. And then, and basically treat it as such. So I consider it to be seven, seven, and five."
"Goes without saying the presence of eosinophils. If you go without, in that particular... I'm not aware of that slide, of that study, but I'm definitely not surprised with the fact that there is an asymptomatic time, I'm very aware of the fact that some of the COPD patients do have a high eosinophil count that makes them more likely to benefit from the use of steroids inhaled corticosteroids. But again, I made my point already before that these are, to me, it's beyond just being on ICS, is about maybe being on biologics in the future. So I would say seven, seven, and they're all sevens, all those every single one of those is relevant. Every single one is what's the second category?"
"Treatment may allow for disease progression. Yeah, it's a very unfortunate slide, very sad slide. And that's almost like basically everything, all the points I've been making here and there throughout our conversation about the importance of starting aggressive treatment very early on, not waiting for that. A single moderate exacerbation may almost double the rate of decline. So that's exactly my point. I think I said it to you before, once that first exacerbation happened, you already lost a very important battle. So it's all about preventing that first exacerbation and the current guidelines don't bring that point to the importance that it deserves unfortunately. They're still telling you to wait for that first ER admission. Why? It's not... That should not happen. That's not how you... That's not the point where you should change your therapy. Your therapy should change way before that. So it's extremely important point. That's a seven, seven. And I'm going to give you seven on behalf of everyone else, because that's something that should motivate every single physician to be aware of that."
"Yeah. Treatment optimization across 40 areas can help to transform the care. Identification early diagnosis, quantification of future risk through phenotype of patients identify those are yeah. Very nice algorithm. The one, two, three, and four are very important points. Each one of them is relevant in its own way, but they're all extremely relevant to how we manage a patient with COPD. A little confusing. I'm not sure I'm getting the... At these percentages relate to the reduction in exacerbation. Are these, what are those 22% 42%. 30%?"
"In falling in a mortality. Yeah, I think the only thing I have on this is that this, the 30% doesn't really seem to have the impact in terms of the importance of triple therapy. That 30%, I don't think it's, it does justice to the importance of triple therapy in the symptom of COPD."
"Because the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events by adding triple therapy, if I'm not mistaken is over 50%. And I think this is, it's important to bring forth. I just don't want to minimize the impact of what it, what triple therapy has on..."
"Take away. The extreme importance of starting that... I think that slide before last is the, was the most important one in terms of the message that needs to be brought forth."
"With that whole situation, which is the importance of preventing that first exacerbation from happening. So,   01:11:43  is prevent that first exacerbation from happening at enterprise."
Out of the four that are on my screen right now?
I would choose I for sure. And I would choose... And F. F and I.
"O, and all right. Yeah. But you said compelling and concise. It's O."
"Okay. So, okay we can go back up. So I think the first one I would choose is K."
"Okay, perfect. So K would be number one, I would say C remains where it is after that. D would I mean, is that, D or I'm not sure what..."
"Yeah. I would keep D where it is. So we going next to, right, right? Is that the order we're going in?"
And then after that we're doing F would remain where it is right now. I would remain where it is. J would remain where it is.
"You know, I would put O right after F actually   01:18:22  And then move everything down. Yep."
"Interesting. Yeah. Seems to have the highest mortality. Okay. Let's go. Most important impact is in cardiovascular disease or cause total definitely deduction, but it seems to be mostly in cardiovascular disease and without the reduction of that from respiratory that's interesting. Okay, next. Yeah, okay next."
With higher eosinophil counts. Okay. Seems to be bringing...
"I mean, again, it brings out, it brings forward everything we know already about triple therapy. A couple things that are interesting in the sky, not necessarily in product access, the fact that the reduction and mortality is most related for the vascular events and not necessarily related to respiratory events. So, by reducing this little center area that I was telling you about in that one of the slides where you have the hypoxia tachycardia and one more factor, it's extremely important. That's, what or seems to be, even though we're not reducing the mortality from respiratory issues, but by reducing the incidence of hypoxia tachycardia, we are reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events. So very important point that's number one. Number two, product that seems to be standing out from, from the crowd, a little bit of triple therapy product, by bringing forth that importance of that eosinophil count, almost single handedly in the world of COPD at this point, which is very interesting in, and by itself, the fact that eosinophil count is being brought forth into the COPD battle is extremely important."
And I'm very glad about that because that's been unrecognized for very for a very long time. And it's about time for that subject to be put front and center at this point.
"I would say, yeah. In a few words, you said?"
"Oh, I would say you have to try to identify your COPD patient as early as possible for risk of patient. And those patients need to be placed on triple therapy to prevent a high rate of mortality that can happen from cardiovascular events and also for the treatment of the possible underlying eosinophilic component to the COPD that may benefit from that triple treatment. But the key to this is to stand out, to make the key to this is to make the work as early as possible stand out in that whole, in that..."
"Okay. We have the doctor on the line. Mindy, you may go ahead."
"I am a general internist. I've been in practice for 28 years. I see 18 and older, but mostly really 65 and older, more geriatrics in my practice. I'm in suburban, Maryland. I'm part of a large primary care group practice, independently owned."
"Mostly Medicare. Mostly, like I say, over 65. Some are younger, but they've had tobacco use either ongoing or in the past, that was significant. Mostly  inaudible 00:02:36 , to upper middle class."
"Well, it's pretty easy to do now, because there's two inhalers that we can just prescribe one prescription. But usually, it's something when they've already been on chemotherapy, and still having exacerbations or still having symptoms that interfere with their quality of life."
"Well, of course physical exam. We used to do PFT's in the office, but with COVID, we're not doing any PFT's, because of the risk of spread of droplets. So, physical exam, history, chest x-ray if needed, and then treatment to... A lot of times it's just by history, you can tell what's going on, history and exam."
"No. If we think they're needed, we would refer."
"You don't always need it. Sometimes you can just tell. I mean, if they have a significant tobacco history and there's nothing, they don't have edema, their lungs, they're just wheezing, the x-rays clear, you kind of get a sense of what's happening."
"Most of my patients are not first time I'm seeing them for shortness of breath. So, they already have an established diagnosis, a majority of the time."
"Okay. So yeah, physical exam, history, pulse ox on everyone. So, that helps. But mostly, it's history and exam."
"Sometimes. I mean, it would depend. It depends on how severe their symptoms are, if they're not improving with what I give them. Right now though, there's such a delay in getting in with a pulmonary doctor, that we tend to do most things ourselves."
"At least  inaudible 00:05:40 , or even second, third line, before we send them to pulmonary, because it takes months to get in."
"We do. If that's part... If their blood pressure's high, if you hear fluid in their lungs, they've got edema. If they're tachycardic. I mean all of that's part of the initial history and physical. So, yes."
Yes. Correct. An EKG in the office. A lot of times atrial fibrillation will present a shortness of breath.
"Well, treat whatever the underlying cause. I mean, if I think it's ischemia, we have them see a cardiologist. If it's AFib, and they need cardioversion or they need something more. Most of the time they get sent to a cardiologist, because they'll need an echo, and we don't. So yeah. Usually if it's cardiac,  inaudible 00:06:56  they almost always get to see a cardiologist."
"We usually treat. Prescribe something, treat, follow them."
"High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, depression."
"I would say all of them, but probably high blood pressure and diabetes."
"I usually manage all the comorbidities. There's very few that I would send out to a specialist. I mean, if they're suicidal, they'll see a psychiatrist, but almost all the other comorbidities, I'm managing."
"No. I mean, that's what I do. Like, that's what I do every day."
"Not that other than what we said, the cardiac reasons, atrial fibrillation with a rate over 150, they're going to the emergency room or it would depend what the situation is, but usually,  inaudible 00:09:33  what I would do."
"You kind of consider it all the time, because it's usually, this is an age group that's at risk for that."
"Well, you just don't want to aggravate another condition by treating the underlying problem. I mean, you take everything in consideration."
"I mean, you don't want to give them, like with COPD, you don't want to give them something that will cause tachycardia, if they already have that. You don't want them to be using albuterol every four hours, because that's going to make their heart race and they already have tachycardia. So, you kind of have to... You look at the whole patient, and try to make it based on everything going on."
"Yeah. I mean, because again, just like you're looking at the whole patient, whenever you're prescribing the medication, what's the reason for it?"
"Risk factors for heart disease? Is that what you're asking, or risk factors for what?"
"High blood pressure, smoking history, high cholesterol, diabetes."
"The ones that have no coronary artery disease, are usually followed by a cardiologist too, but usually they're stable. It's rare that both their heart and COPD flares at the same time, although it's certainly possible. But, usually those are patients in an inpatient setting. They're being admitted. It's trying to tease out which one's causing more of an issue. But in the outpatient setting, it's usually... They're usually followed by, like I say, a cardiologist if they have coronary disease, but we can do the EKG. We can look at their blood pressure, the physical exam and treat accordingly. We usually have close follow up so we can see, sometimes there are both conditions flaring at the same time and we just adjust medication treatment accordingly."
"It just depends. I think at this point, it depends on how they present, and what's going on when I see them."
"Well, I mean, if their heart rate's fast already, I'm thinking atrial fibrillation, tachycardia. I'm not going to give them something that's going to make their heart race even more. Blood pressure's high, or they're diabetic and their sugars are already 300, I'm less likely to prescribe prednisone. I mean, it would just depend on the whole patient, and every patient's different. So, it just depends on what's in front of me."
"Yeah. I use dual therapy pretty often. It doesn't matter if they have cardiovascular disease or not. I think, if it's COPD, I can to use dual therapy pretty often if I'm seeing them with shortness of breath from COPD. So, I'll use that, almost on most people I'm seeing in the office, with an exacerbation. Then, the triple therapy, some of it comes down to insurance and formulary and cost, and it just depends on how well they're doing on dual therapy."
How does... I'm not sure I understand the question.
There's no difference. It wouldn't matter.
"Well, if there's any concern of ischemia. If there's any tachycardia. If they have Af Ib. If there's a reason that we need to do an echo or further testing, a stress test, they see a cardiologist."
"They usually send us their notes, or we discuss it. But, it's usually, they treat the heart and we would be treating the COPD."
"Usually with our notes. We share the same electronic records, so everything's visible to everyone. So, they can see what I've been doing, what I've been prescribing and I can see what they're doing."
"I mean, it's the age group that most of these people, especially with the smoking, that these are conditions that you're likely to see both, because they have the same underlying risk factors that contribute to this."
"Not usually. I mean, because we see probably more separately than together. At least I do in my practice."
"Well, it could because there's less stress on the heart. You're less likely... If you're breathing better, you're putting less stress on the heart. You're less likely a right-sided heart failure. You know, certainly you want to optimize both conditions."
"No, I don't really see that being a big difference. I don't think it really makes that much of a difference."
"We don't typically look at it that way. So, I wouldn't say that it's their COPD is worsening their heart disease. I would say no. I don't look at it that way. I would think that they could be just having a decline in both, but I don't really think of that triggering the worsening of the heart condition."
"That it looks like even in COPD cases, that heart disease plays a significant role."
"It's not surprising, because again, these are patients that usually have smoking history, so that it's not unusual that you see both of these conditions together."
"That we do see these together. It doesn't necessarily mean that COPD is triggering the heart disease, or vice versa. I think we just see these two conditions together often, because of the underlying risk factors."
"Again, I mean, that's typically what we see. Usually heart-related conditions is what triggers most deaths, regardless of what else they have going on. Even if they have cancer, it can be a heart attack is what eventually is what's written on the death certificate. So, it's not that un-... Most people, especially if they have significant COPD, they've been smoking for years usually, and that also leads to heart disease. So, it's not that unexpected."
"All right. That's kind of what we... The more that's going on with the patient, usually the higher risk of more serious illness and mortality. That's not surprising information."
"Well that if you do have COPD and heart disease, you have an increased risk of dying from those conditions and that's typically, that's what we see. So, I don't think that's surprising."
"Not necessarily, because I also think you would see the same data if it was like diabetes. If you have diabetes and  inaudible 00:25:17  more likely to have an issue increased mortality, than if it was just the heart disease alone, but most people with heart disease do have comorbidities, so it's very unusual to have someone just with heart disease."
"Okay. So, that's new information for me, because I would not... I haven't seen this before, that you have increased risk with an exacerbation. So, are they defining a moderate exacerbation as one that is hospitalized for, or is it one that's treated   00:26:12 ..."
"Let me see if I can see, the risk of   00:26:22 ..."
"Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's new to me, and it could be just the stress on the body from difficulty with breathing."
"Clinically, I do not see this, like in my experience. I haven't really seen people having heart attacks with any exacerbation. I mean, typically I've seen this in hospital settings, but those are more like a severe exacerbation, not someone that we're seeing as an outpatient. Most of my outpatient patients that we're treating with steroids or antibiotics. Usually, we're not seeing them back with a heart attack in a few days. So this, I think this is more likely with the severe exacerbations in the hospital setting. I have seen that, but those are more hospitalized patients, that are at that acuity to begin with. I don't think I've had a patient with a stroke within 10 days of a COPD exacerbation, in my whole career. So, I don't know."
"I know I've had a few people with MI's after, when they were hospitalized with COPD, but again, they were the severe exacerbations in the hospitalized setting."
"Certainly goes against what I see clinically. The MI, I have, but again, it's been severe exacerbations in hospitalized patients, so yeah. But, it would be interesting to look more at the data that's behind this to see. Yeah."
"Yeah. I'm surprised, because that's not what I really see in my years of treating COPD patients."
"Again, that you would want to prevent the exacerbation, if this is real."
"Okay. So, the triple therapy is much better than the dual therapy, it looks like on the graph. So, that those with moderate to severe COPD, we should be using triple therapy to reduce the risk of death, it sounds like."
"I'd say it's compelling. I mean, this is a good visual. You can see how definitely there's a decrease with using triple therapy."
"Not really. This is kind of... I am surprised that there's so much of a change. I would think it wouldn't be that significant, but I'm surprised the LAMA/LABA combination, is not comparable to the steroid/LABA combination, that there's such a... At a year, there's such a difference."
"Well, again, you want to prevent the exacerbations, is what the key is and it sounds like the triple therapy does that best, by reducing the risks long run."
"Yeah, that's impressive. I think it's compelling."
"Okay. So, it's kind of similar that even if it's not mortality, you're looking at your endpoint. You're having less cardiovascular events. So, it again, supports using product X."
"Well, it seems like what the first graph shows, the LAMA/LABA combination, has the worst outcome, which is what we saw previously. Then, I think it does look like product X and the ICS/LABA combination are similar, in with some of these other or cardiovascular conditions."
"Well, again, it's another reason to use it."
"Right. Well, right. Certainly it's more impressive showing that the LAMA/LABA combination, isn't as helpful."
"  00:34:51 . Because of the way the data is, it's showing that real isn't as effective."
"Inhaled steroids, I use those quite often."
"It's just oral steroids, I'm hesitant if they're diabetic, out of control or if something else is happening. An inhaled   00:35:30 ..."
"I usually don't look at this, because I think it's too busy. I like looking at the graphs, better. Like if I was shown this, and I really didn't even pay attention to that. So, I prefer looking at the graphs, because it's more visually appealing, and makes more sense."
"Now, I think it correlates to what we were saying, how the LAMA/LABA combination, is not as effective, and so that I think is what's more impressive with this data."
"You know, it's hard to say, because it goes along with what we've heard before, that when you have a COPD exacerbation, you die for another reason. If you're going to, you're going to have other issues going on with your heart, and that's kind of what this is demonstrating."
"Not to use as much of the LAMA/LABA combination, in those with moderate to severe COPD, which is actually what I do now. I use it more in mild cases."
"I use it more in mild cases, yeah. I don't usually use it for moderate COPD, that alone."
"Usually the inhaled steroid/LABA or triple therapy, if it's, if they're having more exacerbations."
We just confirmed what I'm already doing.
"So yeah, this is similar to the other one. So again, it shows   00:38:38 ..."
"Okay. It just confirms that the triple therapy really is standing out, like what we've seen before."
"Not really, because the curve itself, you can see that there's a significant difference. So, I mean you can put it  inaudible 00:39:27 , but I think most people can take that away from just looking at the graph."
"That makes sense, because if you're not straining the heart by having an exacerbation, then that's going to help. So, I mean, the goal is usually to prevent exacerbations and maintain optimal respiratory status. So, this goes along with that."
"All right. So, I'm not... So, I'm not really quite sure what the difference between product Y and product X are."
"Okay. So, but they have the same ingredients. So, you would think they should be similar. So, it's just your studies, I guess, on the different drugs have shown a difference. Then, it's talking about other drugs and what they can do in preventing death."
Yeah. Yeah. Some of those are  inaudible 00:41:56 ...
"I wouldn't be able to tell you the specifics, but yeah. I mean the other drugs are ones that we're using commonly."
"Well, that product X is more effective than product Y, and it's similar to the paradigm data, it looks like."
"It's impressive. But even product Y is similar too, to some of the, it's still giving benefits, that's significant as well."
"Again, that it's effective, that it's a reason to use it."
"I think it's helpful to show this, that it does. Again, it's looking at the whole patient, and that this can and really help. Yeah, I think it does."
"Because you could see like the graph itself, that this is really helping prevent deaths, from other reasons."
"I think it's compelling. Yeah, I think it's good."
"It's impressive. It seems like that product certainly can help with reducing death, and probably should be used more often, I would think, even at the first exacerbation. The goal is to prevent exacerbation."
"It's more complicated than that, because it comes down to insurance coverage. It comes down to what the patient has to pay for, so I do use if I can, but a lot of times it needs preauthorization or problems that it's more difficult to get than just writing a prescription."
"Yeah, it would be used more often, because I think it is beneficial."
"Just that I don't usually see a lot of like the vascular deaths following an exacerbation, but I'll have to pay attention to that, and probably be more aggressive in treating."
"Well, it's just useful information and, it would be useful to use this. Having it in one inhaler is convenient, but a lot of times patients have already been doing this with multiple inhalers. So, some of this has already been... You know, we've been doing it."
"Oh, it's convenient. So, especially with most of these on multiple other medications for their illnesses, this is much more convenient."
"Well, I'm in a private practice with a few other practitioners in a large urban setting. I'm Family of Medicine Board Certified. I mean, nine years, practice, so we have a variety of patients, and certainly adult patients. COPD is part of the encounter. And so, we hardly send them to anyone specialized such as pulmonary or cardiology. We try to manage our patients. There are a lot of options as far as pharmacotherapy."
"Well, it made good sense. You got three medication two long-acting bronchodilator and corticosteroid, and generally that's the combination. Either open or you can combined. In the market, in the U.S., there's two triple therapy all in one. "
"The idea is to make it convenient for the patients. Less confusion. Easy to use. One time a day. And study has shown   00:03:34  ... Study has shown that there's roughly less exacerbations over a year, compared to non-triple therapy."
"Well, yeah. The patient's still symptomatic. Oftentimes, have to make sick visit trip to the ER. Then you've got to manage the medicine better and maybe they-"
"Well, yeah. With a triple, you have less. You have a steroid added to it, compared to just LAMA-LABA. So studies have shown that there's less exacerbation of symptoms. And so,   00:04:43 , it makes good sense-"
"Yeah, as well. A triple is better than the double, in general. "
"Well, severe, obviously they end up having oxygen given, maybe hospitalized. They could be given IV steroid or a short burst of steroids."
"In a moderate, they may be symptomatic. From roughly able to, I mean, conduct daily activities to a point now where they're short of breath easily and coughing excessively and having chest tightness. Overall, their impact of the daily living is really impacted. "
"Yeah. Yeah. The moderate, they may not need to go to hospital."
And maybe their pulmonary function is decreased from the usual. Maybe ox saturations maybe less than a normal baseline.
"I think especially if they have been on a double either ICS LABA or LAMA-LABA combination and is not doing well. Maybe they're making trips to doctor's office, to urgent care despite they're compliant on the medications. "
"So symptom-driven, the threshold as far as maybe now they should be on a triple combination."
"Well, in our country, I think Trelegy come out first."
"And so, I'm more familiar with it. I mean, the chemical is different. I personally have written more Trelegy Ellipta   00:07:57 -"
"Now, I'm not familiar with the second one that you talk about. "
I don't really know the difference. I think Breztri has been lately been pushing their product. Lots of visit to the office. They show data that they might have a 20% reduction in annual exacerbation compared to the dual therapy. I don't know how the head to head they compared with Trelegy. 
"So I can't put a two, and say one is more superior than the other."
"I think they're trying to communicate to me is that they have, study has shown the reductions of exacerbations of patients. That's all that I remembered."
"Well, it highlighted a lot about risk of death. I think that was all right in the beginning. Maybe one out of five people with exacerbation, they die within a year. And so, with Breztri, you can reduce that risk up to, I believe, over 50% relatively compared to the other dual combination. "
"And so, overall the overall, the idea is that the closed triple therapy is reducing hospitalizations, reducing exacerbations, compared to your standard dual LABA-LAMA or ICS LAMA. "
"Well, I'm not going to ... Yeah. I think it's credible because it's done through studies. I'd like to look at a study and how it was defined and how many patient involved, and what is the primary outcome measure. And so, when they give you a percentage, sometimes it depends on how you determine the primary outcome is. "
Yeah. (Silence). Does this reduce the risk of exacerbations? Is that the question?
"Well, yeah. Even before the triple come out, the closed triple, using the dual and added an ICS. So now the triple come out and they get much simpler for the patients. And so, it makes good sense that all of these ... Well, you've got an antiinflammatory added to two bronchodilators. That's the backbone of treatment. It should be the standard of treatment now for COPD."
"Yeah. I think that now that you've got two triple that maybe they can be compared head to head. Just that personal experience, just maybe start learning more to use Breztri and see how patients perform. I don't have any negative about Breztri, I just don't have much clinical experience in using it."
"But with the data provided, it make good sense to try. "
It's compelling. It's compelling. And I do have rep come in and I have samples. So it's just waiting for an opportunity. It's not   00:19:45 -
Yeah. It talked about reduction of exacerbation. They talk about reducing risks of death and reducing all cause mortality by 49%. Those are compelling information that the triple should be your standard. 
I'm going to lean toward maybe as a class effect. 
"Well, this is differentiated because it does not compare to, let's say, even the open triple. It only compared to dual combinations."
"You cannot then measure and say, ""Well ..."" Obviously the triple had more  inaudible 00:21:46  leave it behind reduction of symptoms, but if you are going to convince the reader and say, ""Hey, look. This is the best triple out there."" Well, then, do a triple combination comparison study. Then convince me and say, ""Look, this is the outcome."""
"Seven, because you're talking about a product. "
"I would say this would be the middle, a four. "
"Well, I think it highlights the risk of COPD exacerbations, including death. And also, give you very alarming statistic, one out of five people die within the first hospitalization. We need to take this tremendously seriously. We got to get to it and provide the best treatment. "
"No. No. I think it's very right to the point. Why are you treating COPD with the best option? Well, because of these compelling statistics. Death, certainly alarm people, and myocardial infarction. Twice the amount, the rate, so that's very compelling, and say, ""Look. This is the problem."" And following that, that may be the solution."
"Personally, I like the first present option. It was more clear. "
"Well, this one also mentioned on the last line there, high bullet font there, the first one didn't say that. That COPD's the third leading cause of death and remaining on the rise. This is like a red light flashing at you and, ""Look, hey. Don't think just cancer, heart disease. Think of COPD is the third leading cause of death."" "
"Well, I think visually, having bar graph   00:26:54 -"
"No.   00:27:23 . It's stated right. It's not too wordy and it's easy to read. You can look at that and 30 seconds and done with it, so I like it that way. "
"Yeah. Then they talk through it more. It's about, it's not just the symptoms of shortness of breath and cough, but there are other further negative down the stream is they could have twice the risk of heart attack. That mental health is three times more affected with depression and anxiety. "
"Yeah. That reason that you should take this problem and take care of it right at the beginning because if not, the patient is going to suffer all these other consequences. Not   00:28:41  only do they have to deal with more chances of getting a heart attack and then they're depressed and cannot function. And then, they have increased hospitalizations. Well, yeah. There are a lot of unmet needs and this piece state about it. "
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). (Silence). Well, yeah. You get the idea. You look at it and look at all the risks. So, yeah. I got it. But I mean, if it's in a busy practice and you come in with a iPad with all these pages, I don't know. Do I have all the time to read it? "
"Well, this one talk about the increased risks but it does not talk about, let's say, what amount of risk. Whereas, the other piece, talks about two times risk or MI. Okay?"
"20%. 20% more hospitalizations. Three times more mental health problem or cardiac like issue. Or this one only say, ""Well, there, you're going to have these risks,"" but I don't know the quantity of it. "
No. No. I thought I'm looking at the box that say original U. I'll give it a two. 
"Well, it also mentioned at the bottom line, is the impression, if your patient needed treatment, it goes beyond better briefing. Well, you have all these identified risks here. Well, by getting a better treatment, you're going to mitigate some of these high risk, twice to three times more of certain conditions."
"Well, it show that Breztri, a triple therapy, lower the risks of exacerbations. Whether you compare it to LAMA-LABA, or ICS LABA. And so, we kind of expect it, we just don't know what the percentage of reduction is."
"Well, this one talk about ... The bulk of it talk about over half reduction of severe exacerbations versus LAMA-LABA. This is clearly talking about the comparison of Breztri versus LAMA-LABA combination. They write 52% reduction is symptoms exacerbation. Well, I get it. Okay?"
"Well, we understand it because it's purely talking about Breztri. They're not talking about a triple therapy study here, where you see Breztri versus your unknown LABA-LAMA combination. "
"So I don't take that away from it, to say, ""Only Breztri."" But going back to originally, they convinced me that only Breztri triple have these attributes compared to dual therapy. I say, ""No. I gave it a four,"" because I don't have a triple combination comparison here."
"That other triple combination might also show some reduction. Don't know their numbers, but I suspect that it will provide a reduction of exacerbations compared to a dual therapy. "
"It's kind of confusing. On the left side on the graph. Generally I'd be more familiar with graphs going up and down, not at left and right, and right to left. "
Yeah. That's very significant. Only one in three. That's a very significant small numbers that indicate Breztri is effective. 
"Well, on the left can we not have the prior one that showed it going down arrow, rather than this sideway one? "
Yeah. I think both is an improvement. Yeah.
"I would say ... (Silence). Two, one, and three across. "
"Oh, no. I'm sorry. Two, three and one. Sorry."
One. I'm sorry. Three. (Silence). Two and one. 
"Yeah. I think the number intend to treat, I think that's very unique. At least, that's what Breztri is trying to claim. And so, I would believe that's true and so I think that may be unique. "
"Oh, yeah. It talked about reduction only compared to ICS and LABA. We had to reuse that way, and if you don't reach into the middle, and I caught it a few times, that it's not significant differences compared to LAMA-LABA. But they're being truthful about their study, and so we had to take it the way it is. Okay. It's still better. You're ICS LABA combinations, 20% reductions in hospitalizations. So the intent to treat is one out of 31 people. "
"Oh, yeah. That's still not a high numbers. 30 people get the benefit of it. I mean, one person will be prevented from hospitalizations out of the 30 that you treated. That, in itself, saves a lot of money. "
"Well, yeah. They say that, a few times, compared to a LAMA-LABA is not significant as studies show. The reduction rate. Yeah. "
"Well, no. It's not inferior, number one. I'm not doing anything that worsened the problem. And maybe even the number may be treated a little bit differently, it might show some improvement. So I'm not doing any harm. Number one. In my mind, a triple therapy probably is better than a dual combination. Right? Especially those on ICS and LABA. "
"I'm not following the last line there. I'm not familiar with that, Type One Error Control. Is there an explanation? "
Yeah. I assume these are acronyms for the study.   00:47:10  ... E-T-H-O-S? KRONOS? 
These are acronym for the study or the trial?
"Yeah, I mean, this one is confusing to me, is they talk about reduction in the hospitalization versus dual. Yeah, standard dual LAMA-LABA or ICS LABA. But yeah, if you read the smaller font line, it's saying, ""Not significant."" Both of them, ""Not significant."" What is it they try to communicate to me? They've got a down going arrow, a 20% on one side, the other one versus LABA-LAMA, 64%. But yet when you read the footprint, and they say, ""Not significant."" "
"Well, if I wanted to be convinced that Breztri is a good option, I would rather see this piece. "
"Well, you talk about protecting one with 30 patient treated. "
"Well, to the right with a bar graph, it did not ... At least, I didn't see any footnotes saying, ""Not significant."" The T value. That one is more convincing. "
"Well, because they talk about the patient that ... These group of patients that tend to be more severe. These are more life-threatening cases. And so you, maybe selecting out even the sicker patients and it still showed these reductions, then I'll be more convinced."
"Yeah, because it showed that hospitalization  inaudible 00:51:28  reduced they intend to treat one out of 31 patients. I think that trumps just the dual therapy."
"I would say, two. Three. Four. And a one."
"Well it did show the Breztri shows reductions particular, I'm talking about death, particular with comparison to LAMA-LABA. Almost 50%. Couldn't draw much conclusion versus LABA and ICS because you could say that it is not significant. "
"And so, yeah. Somebody on LAMA-LABA, you have to think about getting them on Breztri because it helps people have reduction of death. "
"Well, it's a larger number of patients needed to be treated but I'm not going to take away ... It's not significant to ... You get many patients with COPD, and so randomly somebody's death reduction is going to happen. "
Right. This one focused versus the LAMA-LABA. 
"Well yeah. It's clearly stated. Compared to LAMA-LABA this 49% reduction of death. And one out of 80 patients intend to treat, will be prevented."
"No. This one's trying to put a little bit of a humanistic feeling to it, but as a provider, I mean we're not cold hearted, we understand. Every death is significant to every family. Is that going to convince me that this is a better way to state it? I'm not convinced. "
Let's read the hard science of it. Not to spin it with some emotion. 
"A very busy slide, but on the left it looks like Breztri still performs better in the  inaudible 00:59:18  study in the percentage of just the  inaudible 00:59:25  reduction. Well, they might stretch it out. Make it large differences, but you read the absolute number on the bottom, it's what? Less than a 0.5 differences compared to the impact study. "
"Well, but let's still not take away that Breztri is not better. It's just not as a significant difference when you just glance at the bar graph. "
"Yeah. You're going back to the beginning about hospitalization reduction. You talk about twice the number of MI on compared to a standard treatment. Well, this is maybe the proof that you have cardio protections-"
... and you've got a breakdown of the study and even compare the standard open triple therapy. 
"Oh. Well, yeah. I think this one needed to be, the additional slide should be included because none of the previous slides talk about cardiac protection."
"Well, I think it just we construct similar data that was presented earlier in a different way, particularly on the left side. To the right, you say, well, you favor Breztri. But-"
"Well, but that's why we say, going back, that you need to provide a patient the best option right in the beginning.   01:04:43 . Why wait until an exacerbation to start them on triple."
"Well, yeah. This one stated the  inaudible 01:05:23  on the left. More than 3/4 percent of the people, even without prior exacerbations, might have exacerbations within three years, so don't wait until they have exacerbations to think about triple. "
I think I would give it a six now. It does including a comparison with an open triple as far as cardio protection. I don't believe the other product talked about that.
"Well, it's certainly much better in performance compared to your LAMA-LABA. Not so much compared to your ICS and LABA in some of the studies as far as reduction of hospitalization. But they also had the cardio protection study to it. And so, it's compelling that way. You reduce death. And then tend to treat, it could be a range from one to three, and one to 80, which is still, luckily, small numbers. It has several trials even with the sickest patients, and it's still showed reduction. So I think it's convincing enough."
"Yeah, so I'm a cardiologist. I'm in a private practice. I practice outside a major city. It's kind of a mixed demographic, middle aged to elderly, a lot of vascular disease, a lot of hypertension, a lot of heart failure, both systolic and diastolic heart failure."
"Yeah. Probably, it's about 70/30, about 70% in outpatient and 30 inpatient."
"Yeah, absolutely. Those are familiar terms."
"Yeah, I mean, I think those groups have been teased out in some of the studies and in some... So there are people that don't have traditional ejection fractions under 40% or significantly reduced, and they're not...50's considered by a lot of people to be kind of still in the normal range. So you have that group that's in the 40 or 45 that are sort of, maybe in a... You say that they have mildly impaired heart function, but in general they don't really fit squarely in deed, the other category."
"Yeah.  inaudible 00:03:24  look at it, those are sort of, again, numbers that are floated around sometimes in that ballpark."
"So probably, I'd say, 80 are impaired or HFrEF, maybe 30 are HFpEF, and then the other 10 might be in that kind of gray zone."
"So, I mean, there can be a continuum and it might be that what you're seeing when you initially evaluate someone for heart failure and their heart function is still intact, anatomically, that they're on a continuum where they will remodel into impaired heart function. And there may be various factors that may contribute to that process. Or there may be a subset of people that had their own unique manifestation of heart failure, in the setting of preserved heart function, where the ability of the heart to relax and the diastolic filling parameters and relaxation capabilities are impaired. And those people may not necessarily go on to carry the same pathophysiology as a HFrEF patient. So there probably two distinct types of patients. And then there may be a continuum, and maybe some of those patients in the middle group, may be in transition towards a HFrEF."
Yeah. And a lot of the patients that have impaired systolic function will have relaxation problems too. But they do have a different pathophysiology for cardiac indices and high prone pressures. And they are unique as compared to the HFpEF patients.
"Yeah, I think it can certainly be. I mean, I think, a lot of the patients that you see with HFpEF are, some of them have other comorbidities or poorly controlled comorbidities, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, sleep apnea, some of them have valvular issues. But I think that, in general, they may have issues that are driving... Some of them may be elderly and have very, what are called stiff ventricles. So that group has specific kind of driving variables to cause relaxation problems and filling problems. As compared to the other group for which the heart had some insult, whether it be most commonly coronary disease that's caused heart damage or in some circumstances an intrinsic cardiomyopathy, again, occasionally valvular issues."
"In general, it is. I mean, I think generally you've got a lot of different contributing variables for heart failure and there are groups within the two subset groups that define some of the pathophysiology and reasons people get into heart failure."
"Yeah, so I was making reference to that. So patients with poorly controlled hypertension, sometimes very elderly patients that have had chronic hypertension where their hearts become what are called stiff, obese patients may fit that category. Sometimes diabetics get stiff, their hearts become what's called stiff, the ability to, the heart's to relax and what's called negative dP/dt comes altered in regards to relaxation criteria. And then you've got patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or hypertensive cardiomyopathy. Those are two groups where the ability of the heart to relax during diastole become impaired. So all those things can lead to, at the end of the day, some elevation filling pressures during diastole that lead to heart failure."
"You do. I mean, I think that generally, the group that's most worrisome is the patients with an impaired, the HFrEf patients are prognostically a more worrisome group. You know, that group has a very poor prognosis. And so that group generally there are a number of therapeutic options, medications that are designed to improve outcome. And those are standard care. Those patients we go looking for reasons why their heart functions are impaired. And we go looking for potential targets to improve their heart function. So they get careful evaluations for ischemia or coronary disease. And they get evaluations in regards to their rhythms, and they get evaluations in regards to valvular issues. And they get evaluations sometimes for secondary things that can cause heart functions to impair."
"And then they get placed on these medications that have documented prognostic value. And in some circumstances, these patients get devices to improve their outcomes and survival. And they may actually help their hearts to function more efficiently. So, so the HFrEF group, historically, got a much more kind of established treatment algorithm and course and things that are standard of care. There are things that are adding to the list of options. There's SGLT2 inhibitors, and there's new classes of medications, recently, that are for decompensated heart failure. So we're sort of expanding some of our options. But again, these are established means to, sort of, improve what's a pretty dismal prognosis for those patients."
"And the patients with preserved heart failure, the HFpEF patients historically have a better overall prognosis. They're not as apt to die within five years. They're not as apt to die of arrhythmias. They're not as apt to have hospitalizations and decompensations. Their quality of life can be impaired and that's a definite target. And historically there have been meds that are beneficial, theoretically, and then improve people's quality of life. More recently, there are a few things that are now, received FDA approval, looking into FDA approval for HFpEF. Entresto, being one that does have now approval, and has some outcomes to support that it improves the natural history. So we're sort of evolving to some treatment options, but, historically, the treatment options have been very limited to things that, theoretically, improve relaxation and improve symptom and quality of life."
"So I think that's a focus and that's an ongoing story. There are studies that have recently been released showing a trend towards improvement, maybe, not of the magnitude of what the drugs do for HFrEF. So that's a story that's evolving, kind of a work in progress as it were. But one where there's a lot of interest and one where there's certainly some activity."
"Yeah, they're not quite there, but again, there's a ground swell, and some studies ongoing that probably will define whether they have a more prominent role. At this point, it's still more information to be collected I think. But some preliminary studies do support, they may have that value for that group too."
"My sense is for that, it probably will be, some data to support value, probably not of the magnitude that you achieve with... Just because when you're doing a study, the more morbid your study group, the more likely you can alter that outcome. So when you're starting with the group that doesn't have a high mortality, you're not probably going to be able to alter cardiovascular mortality. Maybe other parameters, quality of life issues, or six minute walks or things that frankly correlate with subjective improvement. But, again, I guess, we'll find out."
"Yeah, so this is a patient that's, I think, in their mid 50s, type 2 diabetic, overweight, someone that has had hypertension, difficult to control and symptoms of probably class 2 heart failure. Overall heart function is lower/normal, diastolic filling parameters are abnormal for impaired relaxation. I think they have a grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. And clinically are short of breath to moderate activities above and beyond daily living, suffer from some fluid retention and leg edema. And so this is an individual that has heart failure, but has never had a heart attack, has never had severe LV dysfunction, but suffers from elevated filling pressures and heart failure."
"The New York Heart Association, so class 1 is, breathing difficulty with extremes of activity. Class 2, is shortness of breath and functional impairment with activities above and beyond kind of daily living. And class 3, would be daily living breathing difficulty. And class 4, would be at rest."
So somebody that was sent probably for functional impairment and breathing difficulty and having risk factors that have been outlined. And some primary care doctor sent this patient-
"Yeah, that's okay. So this was probably from a primary care doctor that established that this patient was having these symptoms, was high risk and wanted us to evaluate the reasons for their symptoms. And whether they had vascular disease and wanted us to follow these patients."
"I would say a proportion. I would also say there's a proportion that we see through hospitalizations, where people are hospitalized for symptoms and that we treat, and then we continue to follow. So I'd say maybe it's 60% are outpatient, primary care, and maybe 30 to 40% are through hospital admissions."
"Yeah, I'd say less commonly, we may see a patient for clearance for a surgery where there's a EKG abnormality, or someone may be having a procedure for some other reason and run into trouble as an outpatient. And then we see them. So those are the most common. I mean, occasionally, the emergency room will identify patients that have active issues and will not admit them to the hospital, but will set us up to see them to follow-up. So those are other examples of outpatient types of referrals."
"Yeah, they were concerned. They, sort of, made the correlation that diabetics have heart problems and breathing difficulty might be a manifestation of a vascular problem. I can't remember, if the EKG had some issue that raised a question, but they wanted us to evaluate this particular patient for that reason."
"I mean, I think this person's diabetic, but they may have like grade 1 or 2 kidney disease. And I don't think there were any other abnormalities that I can recall that were pertinent for this patient."
"Okay, I'm sorry. Yeah, no major lab abnormalities."
I don't think the primary care doctor had done a BNP. I think we performed the first BNP.
"I think if the patient's in the emergency room, it gets done. I think if the patient is coming from a primary care doctor, usually not."
"Well, I think we order them. I mean, I think if it's not been done, we order them. I mean, I think the issue with diastolic heart failure is, that the BNP may not necessarily be as accurate a predictor of elevated filling pressures and diastolic dysfunction, as it is in HFrEF where it correlates much more effectively with end-diastolic filling pressures."
"Well, it may not be as impressive. You may have a BNP that is borderline or normal or it's mildly elevated, and you may not make the connection that's reflective of heart failure. BNP doesn't, again, it's not as likely to be as deranged in a HFpEF patient."
"So this patient ended up having an echocardiogram, the BNP was done, I think, further labs were ordered, thyroid function, urinalysis for protein, the glycohemoglobin, this person had a sleep study, and had a stress test with nuclear imaging."
So we do the echos the day patients come to see us.
It's part of the initial evaluation and the information is immediate. And it oftentimes will guide the next steps. And it will help to give us an idea as to what problems we're encountering so that we know the urgency of our treatment.
"I think it's unique. I think a lot of practices have an arrangement where they need to schedule their... I mean, we do them in the office. Some of my colleagues don't, they schedule them at the hospital. And they need to follow whatever availability, they may be able to negotiate doing something urgent, but in general, I think, they need to follow some schedule that's put forth by the institution."
"... of the ventricle. And this patient had grade 2 to 3 diastolic dysfunction in their filling parameters. So, sort of, suggestive of impaired relaxation and impaired filling."
"So, I mean, I think each piece adds another level of diagnostic certainty. I mean, HFpEF is not as, it's not as defined as HFrEF, where you see the heart is impaired, you probably have the privy of higher BNP levels that support heart failure. For HFpEF, you take each piece of information and you add it to the diagnosis to come up with a clinical diagnosis. So the clinical story, obviously the echo's very important because those clues where the heart's thickened, the heart's not profoundly impaired from a systolic function standpoint, the diastolic filling parameters are helpful, but those are preload and afterload affected. So you can't hang your hat on those alone. A BNP is helpful but not always diagnostic. And then the final piece may be your response to therapies, which I'm sure we'll get into, but sometimes how patients respond to, in diuresis or to being on medications that help their filling parameters, may also tell you a lot about whether they have HFpEF."
"Yeah, there is. And I think that, you may, for all the world, believe that someone's problem is related to HFpEF, then maybe later you find out that there's more to the story. I mean, some of these patients turn out to be anemic, and they're short of breath and you think that HFpEF's the problem, and they're anemic, and that's why they're short of breath. Sometimes you find coronary disease and that's why they're winded and that's why their symptoms are more prominent. You know, sometimes they've got other underlying, either they've got asthma or some underlying non-cardiac reason to be winded. So there's not a 100 percent correlation with finding these abnormalities and being 100 percent certain of the diagnosis. But usually it's a combination of clinical suspicion, exclusion of other things, and diagnostic clues to data that you're able to accrue."
"So when you may have some conflicting pieces, you may have someone that has parameters that where their heart functions are within that norm, and they have some diastolic filling abnormalities. Their BNP may not be elevated. I mean, maybe that is something that you don't have to support your diagnosis, but you still have HFpEF even in that setting. Maybe you've done a stress test, and the stress test isn't a 100 percent perfect, maybe there's some abnormality on the stress test that doesn't exclude the possibility of some concomitant vascular contribution. Or maybe that person has a valvular issue and maybe they've got some degree of mitral gurgitation. And maybe to some extent that is contributing to their contributing to their symptoms."
"Or maybe you've got somebody profoundly deconditioned and they just are getting pooped out and short of breath because of that issue. Or they're overweight, they've gained weight, someone's gained 20 pounds and they're short of breath. And you've got some parameters that raise the question of diastolic heart failure or HFpEF, but the fact they gained weight may be why they're symptomatic. So there may be a lot to the story that, again, could contribute to the symptoms that we go down that pathway and we may not be as secure that that's the only problem."
"Well, no, I think, yeah, you go through each thing and you may have very definitive data that show it's not the other nine things on your list."
"So a slam dunk would be someone with a real thick ventricle who has markedly impaired diastolic filling parameters, and the BNP is elevated, and they've got classic heart failure symptoms, things that, elevated neck veins or other parameters that would really be consistent with a diagnosis of heart failure. And they respond to the appropriate treatments for heart failure. And there's nothing else going on that you're aware of. So those individuals, you have a lot more confidence going into it that that's what you're dealing with."
"So, I mean, you try to be as, keep it as simple in layman terms as possible. You may point out that there are circumstances where people have... That the heart's responsible for processing blood and it receives blood from your periphery and then pumps it out. And under some circumstances, the pressures required for the heart to function appropriately can become elevated. And that can happen sometimes when the heart's not functioning effectively. But there are other circumstances where the heart simply becomes very stiff. And may use some analogy, like a balloon that's being blown up for the first time versus a balloon that you've blown up 50 times and how much more pressure you need to use in your lungs the first time to open the balloon. And that transmits back to the lungs where the blood is being sent to the left ventricle, which is the pumping chamber, so that those pressures get back transmitted to the lungs, and that's where the symptoms of breathing difficulty may occur."
"Yeah, we use the term heart failure. We say, ""You're in heart failure, but this doesn't carry the same connotation as somebody who has a very, very weak heart. In your circumstance, your heart failure is based on the ability of the heart to fill with blood, not so much the ability of the heart to pump out blood. And that the ramifications, albeit different, can lead to similar symptoms. And this is how we address it."""
"So, I mean, historically, the treatment approaches have been medications that are effective to improve relaxation and diastolic filling, so medications that may have negative chronotropic and inotropic effects may be of value. Things like, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers that have negative chronotropic effects, medications that have negative inotropic effects may be helpful for patients with hypertrophy and impaired filling. Diuretics may be useful if there's elevated filling pressures. And then more recently, obviously, medications like, Entresto, have value by lowering filling pressures basically."
"I mean, in the long run, absolutely. I mean, I think that there are some effects that we have that are, some things that we do that are more immediate. And so for example, slowing down the heart, which allows a longer diastolic filling period, will change those filling parameters immediately. And so, if you're able to take a heart rate that's 90 or 100 and make it 70 or lower and allow more time for diastolic filling, because if you look at the filling, you look at the diastolic filling parameters, the more time you have with impaired relaxation, the lower the pressures will be. So that would be very valuable."
"Some of the other meds may work both immediately and longer term. Regressing left to right hypertrophy and improving diastolic filling parameters you may take some time, if the means by which you're doing that is to regress hypertrophy that could take weeks or months. But controlling blood pressure, again, we were making reference to those diastolic filling parameters being affected by loading conditions and afterload conditions. And so, if you have a huge afterload, it's going to put a lot of strain on your heart. So lowering your blood of pressure and getting it within range is very, it's valuable. And, again, choosing medications that help to slow the heart rate and improve blood pressure are effective."
"Yeah, so again, at the time that we submitted this info, they're not on Entresto and they may be on Entresto going forward, but this patient has not been on Entresto. I think, again, this patient was started on some of these meds before Entresto, the FDA approve for diastolic heart failure. But may very well be on it in the future."
"Well, if somebody, say somebody responds quite well, or the blood, as you were saying, their blood pressures were horrible. And now they're, they used to run 170s, now they're 130/120, they've lost 20 pounds, might be another issue. You know, their heart rates are better, their diets are better. There may be, like I said, other variables that generally the patient is able to, maybe they had sleep apnea and it's been treated. They may have improved significantly. So that might be an indication where you don't have to necessarily be as proactive  inaudible 00:41:14 . But there are, like I said, outcomes, data with Entresto. So I think that for all intents and purposes of people who remain symptomatic are  inaudible 00:41:22  try to transition if they can afford it."
"Yeah, we would start them on Entresto initially."
"You know, I think it might very well be the recommended... I think it may very well be something that we would use. Again, and this patient's diabetic, which gives you more ammunition that you might be getting more value. So again, I think we're close to circumstance where those things may become standard of care. Still waiting for a little bit more, in the way of, information."
"For... I'm sorry, one more time. Somebody who..."
"Oh, okay. So they're getting... Yeah, so you have to look at what they're on and say, well... In that circumstance, you'd probably start the Entresto. And that circumstance, again, you may look for, retrace your footsteps for other things that could have caused them to get worse and revisit it. Could their vascular disease have changed. Is their renal function worse? Is their diet not good? I mean, what's happened that they've decompensated above and beyond the fact that your treatments aren't working anymore. And then you look at your regimen and you would up-titrate things. If you needed to be more aggressive with beta-blockers, switch to like the Entresto, maybe consider a SGLT2 at that point."
"Yeah, I mean, that doesn't change your... That's just a number, you're still in that same diagnostic category where it doesn't necessarily change how you're going to view this patient because their heart function is still, I mean, 50's normal."
"Yeah, so 50% ejection fraction and 60 are both, they're both normal."
"All right, so now it's 40. So now, you're actually, talking about maybe a HFrEF patient. Now, you're thinking where you're, you've got data from SOLVE and data from some of the other studies that suggest that you're a HFrEF patient. And so now, you're going to be very aggressive with the ARB and you maybe add, you may even add a mineralocorticoid inhibitor like, spironolactone. And you're entering into a different pathophysiology and all those things that we mentioned that are established for HFrEF. Now an SGLT2 becomes a bit more conventional and, again, some of the other medications that may have available for you for HFrEF."
"Yeah, you have logistically now. And you would go on, somebody went from an EF of 50 to 40 is worrisome. What's caused that to happen now? So you that patient may need a heart cath and see what their arteries look like. Or they certainly needed an ischemic workup. They may need to have some things done."
"That's right. That's more worrisome. I mean, it's a more worrisome direction."
"So I think this patient, again, they had a stress test that didn't show anything that needed intervention. Most of the medications, I think were up-titrated at some point. I think that this person got onto some regimens that actually were beneficial. This patient actually ended up on Jardiance for other reasons, which we've helped indirectly, because it's an SGLT2, but they ended up on that medication. Should have been listed. But in any event, this person has gotten, is improved. I think they lost 22 pounds and their symptoms have improved. And they're walking routinely and sort of got the message. So this is someone that was able to actually improve their condition through combination of issues, the right medications, better blood pressure control, and some behavioral stuff which is not always the case. I think they're on a CPAP now, too. They have sleep apnea."
"It was at recently, I think they were switched from, I think, Gliclazide to Jardiance by the diabetic team at our request."
"Well, we usually make it in the office. So usually they have the echo when we go over it."
"Well, it depends. I mean, if we starting them on two meds, we may go like a few weeks, we may go through an entire dialogue regarding their... When we see them initially and we're treating them, we start them on new medications, we usually will go within two weeks. Give them a list of things that they need to report. And then, depending on how they do, they may be an up-titration. It doesn't always mean you need to come back to the office each time sometimes we'll communicate with phones. And then once they're kind of stable, I would say, for someone like this now, maybe four to six months."
"Yeah, I would probably see them, no less than once a year, but maybe twice a year."
"Depends. I mean, I would say that it depends who the primary care doctor is. Sometimes they want to do it and they do a great job. Sometimes they want to do it and they ignore it. Sometimes the patient ends up seeing a diabetic specialist and we'll let them obviously run that part of it. In circumstances where it's being ignored, I'll do it. In circumstances where it's being managed, I won't."
"Yeah. I mean, I don't have any inhibition to start an SGLT2 or to start somebody on a GLP-1. Or to start them on medications that are, again, historically considered to be hypoglycemics that have value for their cardiovascular conditions. And, as opposed to, saying, ""Oh, this might be a good idea."" And then six months go by and they're on the same meds as before. So I don't have a lot in the way of concern about doing that. You know, I let people know, I don't do it in vacuum. But my vantage point, a lot of people do consider those medications to be heart medicines that have some diabetic properties."
"Yeah, there are guidelines and there are circumstances where you keep doing echos every time you see someone. People don't like it. I think, if you have a change in clinical status, you do an echo. I think if you are evaluating the response to a therapy that's designed to affect heart function  inaudible 00:52:11  a repeat echo is appropriate. For example, say you start someone on Entresto with HFrEF, and after a time period, you want to see... Say they're on the fence for getting a defibrillator. And that's totally appropriate at the end of a 90 day period to reassess their heart function, to see whether they qualify. I think if you have somebody stable, that does not have decompensated heart failure and they're on appropriate standard care medicines, and they're doing great. There's not a necessity to be doing one. Again, unless you've got a clinical suspicion or concern, something that's going to change your treatment or your outcome."
"So the BNP has some value longitudinally, in the hospital actually, it's useful because if someone comes in with elevated BNP and you establish that you've been able to lower it during the hospitalization, it confers a better outcome. We can use it longitudinally to gauge the ballpark as to how patients are doing clinically. And sometimes it's the most reliable indication that there may be some alteration in someone's heart failure status even prior to them reporting that they're not feeling well. So we will do them when we, we will add it to all our heart failure patients maybe at least quarterly or twice a year when they do the standard CMP levels for their kidney function and their sugars and their cholesterol and maybe their thyroid. And we'll also do a BNP. Probably don't, we wouldn't use it, necessarily, exclusively, in a vacuum to treat someone, but you would use it in that context to follow somebody's status."
"No, I think it is encouraging to see that diastolic heart failure now has some avenues. Historically, throughout my training it's always been well, diastolic heart failure, we'll use these meds with good intent and hope for the best. But having some ongoing data and clinical trials that show that we can alter diastolic... Because it's not benign, it's not, maybe, not quite as morbid as systolic, but it's certainly not benign to have diastolic heart failure. And so having mechanisms to alter the natural history are encouraging."
Great. Thank you. I'm glad we could connect here. Have a good   00:55:20 .
"Hi, and thank you all so much for waiting. We have the respondent on the line now.  Diane 00:00:01:39 , you may begin."
"I'm a family practitioner in a midwestern state in the United States in a rural area, I would say. We have a single specialty practice with eight physicians, three PAs, two nurse practitioners. And we see people of all ages, and we do OB so we're a pretty full spectrum practice."
"So I would probably be first point of contact for most people with COPD, with initial diagnosis and evaluation and initial treatment."
"Probably at least one a day, so 30 in a month or so."
"So I would say when we're diagnosing them, we would get full pulmonary function tests to evaluate how severe their COPD is and their baseline lung function, and like you said, smoking cessation. And then we would determine need for inhaler therapy, basically. And so inhaler therapy can involve different types of medications and we would just evaluate their need to those different types."
"Yeah, if we're doing initial therapy on it, usually it's an anti-muscarinic  inaudible 00:06:51  or similar medication. And then we might add on a long acting beta agonist or an inhaled corticosteroid if they're more severe, like a moderate severity."
I think that it's good therapy and it oftentimes makes people feel better and slows the progression of things. It's just very expensive for most people.
Patient symptoms. Objective worsening on pulmonary function tests would prompt me to intensify therapy.
"Yeah. After having more exacerbations and subjective worsening on patient report, then I might. Especially if it's been over a year, I might get repeat pulmonary function tests and see how things have progressed."
"Yeah. All of these things are on the table. But yeah, if they have a severe exacerbation, I'm definitely considering increasing therapy."
I would say number of exacerbations in a year.
"I wouldn't say there's a set number, but more than two per year I would probably increase therapy."
Probably not very many of those. Maybe 25% of those around one inhaler that provide it.
They'll probably give you data about decreasing exacerbations and preservation of current lung function. And then their main selling point would be probably increasing compliance with the inhaler. Since it's in one inhaler it's easier to use and patient compliance increases.
They're just talking about the incidents and prevalence of COPD and the burden on society that it causes.
Probably the thing that matters the most to the healthcare community is the 40% that are readmitted.
"Because that's where all the money is, hospital readmission. So hospital admissions cost a lot of money."
I would say that 40% number was surprising.
"Just the amount of money that it saves to adequately treat COPD. Because obviously that's a main point in the United States is healthcare costs, so they should be showing me how it saves money to treat it."
"Yeah, it doesn't really raise any questions for me, I would say."
"Oh, the motivation is not a lack of information for me. That the motivation is cost, essentially, for most people. If I had an unlimited amount of resources, I'd put everybody on a triple inhaler. But it's mainly about cost why physicians don't prescribe it more probably."
The thing is trying to tell you the things that makes COPD worse.   00:17:53 .
And just where the burden is as far as people affected by it.
"Maybe just the countries that are affected, I guess. In seeing the heat map on the left side there, and which countries have the most is interesting, I would say. But otherwise not much else."
"Oh, I just know this information. This is just known information to me."
"Like we said, everybody knows what causes COPD and what are the risk factors, and so it's fine to rehash those risk factors because repetition is always good. In this country, I wouldn't say the heat map is all that important to emphasize because we're only treating people in our country, and so maybe just the rate in the United States, but that's it."
You always hammer smoking with it and that's the most important thing is to get people to stop smoking. But all those other risk factors are important too.
Another... That's probably a seven. I don't question anything on here.
"No knowledge. And like I said, it's not that I don't want to treat it more, it's just about cost."
"They're trying to get you to treat exacerbations more, saying that they're more common than you think."
"I'm not sure about the data on that. So as far as credibility of data, I'd say this is a five maybe. I would say, yeah, they're probably right that most people don't come in for every exacerbation."
"Maybe about 50% to 70%, 80% of exacerbations are not reported. I'm just not sure on that number. It's not that I think it's wrong necessarily, it's just I would need to look that data up further."
"I believe that, yeah. I think that's probably pretty accurate."
I think all of that's true. Yep. I don't disagree that any of those things happens when you have a exacerbation.
Maybe just hammering the point home that by lowering the frequency of exacerbations is very important because then you're preventing future exacerbations and you're decreasing exacerbations that you'll never even know about.
Yeah. If cost wasn't an issue I'd say this would be a six motivating factor. It does tell you that you're probably missing some exacerbations and treating it would be important.
That exacerbations are causing long term damage and that's why you should treat it more.
"Probably the decrease in FEV1 with an exacerbation, the chart on the right."
That with each exacerbation you're losing a significant amount of lung volume that's useful to you.
"I would say it's something that we're aware of, but we probably don't think a whole lot about. So yeah, it's known, but it just drives the point home a little bit better."
"Yeah, I think that it says the same thing, it's just giving more of an average, I would say."
"Well, it breaks down the numbers a little bit more on the right. The people who are mild have more lung to lose so that's why it's a bigger dip, I think. They both tell the same story though."
Just hearing the point that with each exacerbation you're losing more lung function and making COPD worse if you don't treat their exacerbations and prevent them.
Saying that the rate of exacerbations is an indicator for how likely they are to die in the future.
"Yeah, I think it's just a marker. The more exacerbations you have, it's just a marker of severity, I would say."
Probably that the pie chart on the left there that say the risk of death was increased by so and so percent with so many exacerbations.
"Yeah. I like that graphic a little bit more. But the line chart on the right tells the same story, basically."
That's just showing you mortality over time with how many exacerbations you have per year.
"Maybe with the amount that your risk of death is increased by with three exacerbations. That's a pretty staggering line that's going down pretty quick. So yeah, that'd be surprising."
That the amount of exacerbations is an indicator for how severe they are and how much they need treated.
Probably   00:31:13  that they need to be treated more with appropriate inhaler therapy.
"Just the rate of death, because you're trying to save your patients. So, seeing that line go down pretty fast, it motivates you to treat it better."
The increasing aggressiveness of inhaler therapy.
Saying that other problems can happen after COPD exacerbation besides lung problems and basically cardiovascular problems.
"I need to look at the data more on this too, because cardiovascular events are increased in general in people with COPD mainly because they share a lot of risk factors like smoking and kidney dysfunction and hyperlipidemia. And so, I would have to look a little bit more at the data on this one, but I suspect it's because they share a lot of those risk factors."
Probably the 40% increased risk of stroke is the thing that draws my attention on that side.
The 90% increase for up to a year after an exacerbation of having an event.
"It just shows you that if you have an exacerbation then you need to be thinking about cardiovascular events for a long time after that. And it's not just an acute exacerbation, it's a long term problem."
Nothing is surprising here. I think it's all well known that these things share risk factors with each other.
"No, I'd just say a COPD exacerbation, even once you get through it, it can cause problems down the road or puts you at risk of having other problems."
"I would say because these things are... It's known that these things share risk factors, and most of these patients are already going to be on medications to help prevent cardiovascular problems anyways, and so it's not really going to change practice, I would say."
"Well, maybe it's just because I wouldn't pay as much attention to this page because I already know that I should be treating these risk factors anyways. Yes, these patients are still in my practice and I see them and it applies to them, but it's just not something that I would pay as much attention to."
"Once again, if you have cardiovascular disease these things share risk factors and it increases your mortality if you have both of them."
I would say the cardiovascular disease being higher prominence in severe COPD patients is known just because they share risk factors. So it's not new information to me.
"Yeah. Once again, the more problems you have, the greater your mortality goes up and usually these things go together just because they share so many risk factors."
I would say it's pretty easy. We're just talking about your mortality risk and how much higher it is if you have two conditions rather than one. And so I think it's pretty clear to me.
"Yeah, I think that those are probably accurate."
"I would say that if somebody has COPD, you need to be treating the cardiovascular risk factors too, and doing the standard things to prevent heart events as well."
"Yeah. The thing I was delaying on was I was just trying to understand what was going on on the right side graph and what we're trying to say here. It's a little bit more confusing. They're saying that patients with moderate COPD are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than patients with severe COPD. Not sure that's an accurate statement. So I'm not sure that that graph on the right is relevant because they're saying that of the people that die that have COPD, what are you more likely to die of? Lung problems or cardiac problems? And I would say it's just because their lungs are not as severe, that they are more likely to die of heart related problems. It's not necessarily that there's a thing that you need to treat in moderate COPD that's different. And so, I just don't think that that graph on the right is relevant at all."
"I believe that a lot of COPD deaths are from cardiovascular disease instead, yeah. I think that the graph on the left is accurate."
"Just prior to that, cardiovascular disease and COPD go together, so you need to treat both so that... Treating both helps each condition."
I would say less relevant. Probably a four.
"I don't know. I just don't think that the graph on the right is telling me anything that's important, and the left one is already known, so it's not any new info to me."
"I think it's probably credible, it's probably accurate, it's just not relevant. Yeah. So probably a five on credibility."
Probably a three. It's probably the least motivating one so far.
I'd say it's just not telling a story that makes me want to use more inhalers.
It's just that exacerbations are affecting your cardiovascular system and how the exacerbation leads to cardiac events.
"That little box on the right that says it increases cardiac afterload, decreases ejection fraction increases pressure, increases risk of rupture. Those are all accurate things, I would say, and that is probably the most important box on the page."
"Yeah, exacerbations do cause those things, and that's why you get more cardiac events with exacerbation. So I think that's definitely a link that's true."
"I'd just say the lungs and the heart are connected and when one system fails it's going to make the other system perform poorly. And so that's why you treat both, to help both things."
"That exacerbations are a key indicator that you need to be looking at, and the different risk factors that people show when they're going to be more likely to have an exacerbation."
I would say the more interesting one is the eosinophil count one.   00:48:45 .
"It's just probably the least known one out of this. Yeah, I would say that's why it's more interesting."
"Yeah. I would say that's pretty common knowledge, the other two."
Yes. That would be a point to drive home on this page is eosinophil count may be a key indicator or marker as well.
"Probably a four. This is not a real motivating slide, I would say."
"Yeah, most of these, it's just not going to change what I do because I already know that these things are true."
That exacerbations lead to more exacerbations.
"Just that what I said prior, it's just that more exacerbations you have, you're going to have more. It just leads to more."
"It's a little difficult trying to... That bar graph is probably the harder one. I like the triangle graph on the right just showing that each exacerbation lowers the time to the next one. But the one on the left is just confusing because you're trying to say, well, one exacerbation leads... Well, it's just saying people with COPD... I don't know what it's trying to say there."
I don't think so. I think that the right graph is the one to go with there.
"Yeah. I know that people who have an exacerbation are going to have probably more, and I'd say the more driving slides were prior showing the mortality decrease. So it is motivating, it's just not as much as the prior slides."
"Your subjective feeling a shortness of breath. The more subjective feeling you have, the more likely you are to have an exacerbation, which I would say is common sense."
"Not really telling me anything new here, I would say,"
"I would say most doctors know this, yeah."
"Yeah. If you feel you're more short of breath it's probably because your lungs are worse, yeah."
That your eosinophil count is a marker of your exacerbation risk.
"It's probably true. I'd have to look at the data on it, but it's probably true."
"I look at it in glancing and if I see that it's high I might increase treatment intensification, but it's not something that is the main marker for me."
"Yeah. Emphasize the point that eosinophil can be a marker, and if they have a high eosinophil count, then you should probably treat it with an ICS."
"I would just say it's a surrogate marker that people may not pay as much attention to, and so yeah, it would probably need to be elevated more for people to pay attention to it more."
That they're trying to sell you on the point that you need to start triple therapy earlier.
"I'm not sure that this is accurate, because I would need to look at the data as far as treating with triple therapy earlier, if that is helpful or not."
"I'd be looking for things from the Pulmonology Associations or my own Family Medicine Association saying that you should start triple therapy earlier as it prevents lung function worsening better, and that it's cost effective to do that."
Yeah. Most people do this stepwise treatment approach.
"Yeah, I'd have to check in on that one. I don't know if those are accurate."
Yeah. I would say we need more data to support early triple therapy.
"That would probably be a six, because if it's accurate then maybe I should be doing triple therapy earlier, and so that'd be very relevant to my practice. As far as-"
"Yeah, if it's accurate it's probably a seven motivator for early treatment, but  inaudible 01:01:56  accurate."
"Yeah, I would say all this information is known."
Yep. I already do this. The only thing I would say is different is they're emphasizing triple therapy treatment in the pharmacological treatment section.
"Similar. We would have to see if that is effective, or if it is cost effective to do that."
Everything on here is pretty well known to physicians. I wouldn't say that anything needs to be highlighted more than the others. This is a general overview of what you need to do with COPD people.
The point they're trying to hammer home is triple therapy early in treatment course of COPD would decrease the exacerbations and mortality.
"Like I said, I have to see more data on it, because most people do stepwise treatment approach to it and we would just need to see data that is cost effective and effective to do early triple therapy."
"I'm not sure what the challenges would be outside of cost or supply. If you have enough triple therapy inhalers, I'd give them all to everybody, because the cost is the main challenge."
That maybe we're being too slow in treatment and that we need to escalate treatment quicker.
"Yeah. If the data's accurate, I would want to increase therapy to triple therapy to decrease exacerbations and mortality."
"Yeah, it's trying to sell you on this triple therapy product X that early therapy with it is going to decrease exacerbations, improve mortality in general."
"Yeah, I would just have to look at the data more, but it is compelling if it's true. Yep."
"Yeah. I would say it sets it up for why you should consider the new product, yeah."
"Well,   01:09:40  anybody with COPD that you should do this initially. So there wouldn't be a whole lot of exclusions from potentially doing this product. So it's basically anybody with COPD."
I can just go through them real quick and tell you. So I would keep D.
"Yeah, just because it's an overall summary. Sure."
"I would say people with COPD, you need to prevent exacerbations as the more exacerbations increases utilization of healthcare and mortality. Early therapy with a triple inhaler would prevent more exacerbations and is indicated early in treatment, and that early triple therapy is the best way to decrease mortality and exacerbation risk."
"Nothing else than what we've talked about, really."
"  00:00:03 . But of course everything is completely confidential. We speak to a lot of different healthcare professionals, like yourself, and patients, and so the results are just reported in a aggregated format."
"And the only other thing is adverse events. If anything comes up in relation to one of the sponsoring companies' products, then we just have to report that as a standard procedure for market research interviews."
"But yeah, hopefully nothing will come up. Apart from that, basically the topic of today is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction."
How do you mean? It's a difficult condition to manage?
"Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah, that's what we're interested to hear, right? All of your challenges, your experiences, and really we want to understand the journey that patients take from when they first experience symptoms through presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and followup an ongoing care."
"And I believe in your role, that's going to be mainly in the inpatient setting."
"Cool. Could you tell me a bit more? Tell me about your role, your practice setting."
"And you mentioned, you see a lot of heart failure patients, right?"
"Yeah. Okay, okay. And approximately, of all the heart failure patients you see in your practice, what proportion are with preserved ejection fraction versus reduced?"
"It's okay. I hope everything's okay, right? If you-"
"Okay, okay. Yeah, 60% preserved. And do you consider a middle group, like a mid-range or mildly reduced group?"
"Okay, okay. And how do you define these different groups? So, what's the cutoff?"
"Yeah. Okay, okay. And how do these patients compare? The reduced versus the preserved, are they different?"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative), mm-hmm (affirmative)."
And you already said you see slightly more preserved ejection fraction patients anyway right mow.
"So by that then, is it the case that the preserved patients end up in the hospital more than reduced?"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). And is that something that you see quite regularly, that kind of-"
Okay. Do you think there is the same urgency to act with reduced versus preserved?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, is it that people are not diagnosed because their physician is not aware of the diagnosis or-"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative), mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay, okay. And just quickly, do you think there is any difference with severity of the two conditions? Preserved-"
"  00:17:16 . Yeah, is there any difference? Is one more severe than the other? Is one more serious?"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative), mm-hmm (affirmative)."
"Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Doctor. This is really, really interesting stuff. What I want to do now is just share on screen with you the pre-task that you very kindly completed for us. So, hopefully you can   00:19:26 ."
Okay. Hopefully you can remember these couple of patients. One of them was   00:19:37 -
"Yeah. Okay, cool. Cool. So on the left-hand side, within the last two years, 75... Well, older than   00:19:46 -"
"We did, we did. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. And on the right-hand side, the two years... Well, over two years ago. I think, yeah, we asked for two preserved ejection fraction patients. So, based on the-"
"Okay. Cool, cool. So, that's   00:20:11 -"
"Let's just talk about the patient on the left-hand side, yeah? The preserved-"
"It's okay, it's okay. I think the other patient is going to be interesting to hear a little bit about as well. But let's stay with the   00:22:28  patient on the left."
"Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. I'll stop sharing this just   00:22:52 . Let's keep that patient in mind, right?"
You mentioned they didn't have a close relationship with the physician.
"So it is the case that when, like you said, your students and other physicians, when they see the ejection fraction is normal, then they think it's no problem basically? There's nothing   00:25:35 ?"
"Okay, okay. And the patient that we just had on the-"
" inaudible 00:25:52  patient. When you said, ""The relationship with the physician,"" is that the primary care physician?"
It's actually okay. The gender is fine. It's in Germany   00:26:12 .
"Okay. Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. It makes sense. And I want to check. The patient that we had on screen, was she already diagnosed prior to-"
"... seeing her? Yeah? Okay. So, she was diagnosed as an outpatient?"
"Okay. So the first time she was admitted, what was the   00:29:45 -"
"So, sorry, the first time she was admitted, when you say nothing was done, she wasn't diagnosed or she was?"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). So as a result of that, she ended up back in the hospital?"
"So, when she is discharged from having seen you-"
"Okay. Okay, cool. So it really depends on the hospital the patient is admitted to, right? In terms of their aftercare."
"Okay. And can you just tell me about when she was admitted and you saw her, tell me about what happened. What tests were done? How long was she there in the hospital?"
"Okay, okay. So before she was admitted, she already had a cardiologist and a primary care physician?"
"Okay. So now, she has a new care team. Is that correct?"
Okay. The nephrologist. Was she seeing the nephrologist before as well or was that-
"Okay, okay. So in her case, she was already diagnosed somewhere else and she was admitted-"
"Yeah, okay. Okay. So, they don't follow up the patients as closely and-"
"... they don't keep an eye until it gets very acute, and then the patient has to-"
"Yeah, okay. Okay. Do you also see patients that are admitted, and then you diagnose with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction?"
"So, you read this echo report, and for you reading it, you would see heart failure with preserved?"
Mm-hmm (affirmative). And was he labeled as something else? Like you talked about earlier-
"Okay, okay. So, who actually diagnosed him? Was it you? Was it   00:39:30 ?"
"Yeah, okay. Is there any cardiologist involvement in that or is it just-"
"Okay. So only once they're discharged, and then they see cardiology as followup?"
"Yeah, right. Okay, okay. So in this case, when the patient is actually diagnosed as an inpatient, how long roughly are they expect to stay in hospital? Is it a week as well? Similar-"
"Okay, okay. And in that time, obviously, they see you. You run the BNP, the   00:42:03 , and diagnose them, and then go to cardiology and they see them as an inpatient."
And then what do you need to see to be able to discharge them? Just for them to be breathing normally. What else?
"Okay. Okay, okay. You mentioned the milestones to allow them to discharge. Who kind of writes the discharge letter? Is that-"
And what is there in relation to the diagnosis of heart failure with preserved?
What is included? Is there a diagnosis code?
"It's okay, it's okay. I don't need to know the code."
Okay. And then who decides the treatment plan? Is that yourself? Do you put that in place?   00:44:55 -
"Right. Okay, okay. So this is back to your original point, which is the patient's not being correctly labeled right."
"Yeah, I see. So, the incentive is obviously to keep patients out of the hospital. Can I just quickly reshare this again?"
"So obviously, the patient on the left-hand side, the treatments that they're on, they were decided by... Was that by yourself and the cardiology?"
Okay. And how about the patient on the right-hand side? The mildly reduced patient.
"Right. Okay, okay. Yeah, of course. Of course. Because there's an option. I'm interested. Obviously, they use Entresto in this patient in the right-hand side. Do you see preserved patients also being treated with Entresto?"
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). But on the reduced side, do you see   00:49:38 -"
And what are the perceptions of it as a treatment? What do you think   00:49:46 -
"Yeah. Okay, okay. And you also mentioned Jardiance being used with some type 2 diabetes patient."
What about preserved? What about patients with preserved ejection?
"Yeah, okay. And Doctor, we're almost out of time. I just want to ask. You mentioned quite a few typical issues with preserved ejection fraction. I think particularly physicians missing or not appreciating the condition. What do you think could help? What do you think could help with these problems that you've identified?"
"Okay. Thank you very much, Doctor. It's been great to speak to you and I look forward to listening to your podcast."
Okay. Thank you so much. Take care. Have a good rest of the day.
"Okay. Well, I'm a solo private practice and I've been doing this for about 25 years. My primary interest is in diabetes, metabolic diseases and of course the associated cardiovascular problems, including hypertension, coronary heart disease and hyperlipidemia. So, my patient population is very often unhealthy, a lot of very high incidence of obesity also with COPD. Many of these patients have COPD because they're either many of them are past ex smoke and a few of them continue to smoke now. So these patients they often have many comorbidities."
"No, on triple therapy okay. All right, now, okay so on triple therapy at this point, because unfortunately been using more triple therapy. So I'd say probably now maybe at least 40% are on triple therapy and that number grows."
"Okay, mild, I'm going to say about 20% and probably 60, 65% moderate and the remaining are severe."
"Okay. Well now, so the algorithm, at first when a patient is first diagnosed with COPD, which sometimes is not so easy. I generally start, I mean, it used to be, we started with maybe inhale corticosteroids, something like that, but I don't do that. I start with LAMA/LABA because we thought, some years ago we were starting with LABA and ICS, but now find LAMA/LABA is better and it doesn't involve the use of steroids, which sometimes is not entirely necessary if there's not much inflammation. So we'll go to that point."
"Now, at some point, the patient may have either some exacerbations or on poor control or so on, and then finally you wind up with triple therapy. Which these days is been made much easier because we have the two triple products available. So, it makes it easier to transition the patient from dual therapy to triple therapy, without causing actually any extra burden or any extra devices and so on. So, it's reasonably convenient."
"I'm sorry. Repeat that, the 30% who received?"
"Okay, well these are patients who again, who are on dual therapy and have an inadequate response. All right so how do I tell? All right it's-"
"Okay. So in other words, you're asking, how do I make the decision of who needs triple therapy and who doesn't?"
"Okay. So, every time I see a patient, the first question, how often did you use the rescue inhaler in the past month? And if they say, I use this every day well, clearly they need something more. So, we are not getting ... But if they come in and they say, I don't use it at all. Okay, so then they're fine, they don't need to go up. So, I find that's a convenient way of doing that because I can also quantitate it. How many times did you use your albuterol in the past month? So there's a number, there's a number I can attach to it. So it's less subjective."
"Okay. All right so the first thing is actually history, physical, naturally listening to the chest and so on and so forth. And getting accurate smoking history, and probably a non-contrast CT, which is the recommendation now to check for any neoplasm, something like that. Then go on to spirometer because that's really how the diagnosis is made. Because some people they really don't know what exertion is, what shortness of breath is because some of these people, especially older people who may be retired so, they don't do too much. And some of the people actually hardly move."
"So I say, ""Do you go out for a walk every day?"" I don't do this and so on. ""And so are you short of breath?"" ""No, I'm not short of breath."" but I say, ""Okay, what about when you go up the stairs?"" ""We don't have stairs."" So you understand what I'm getting at?"
"When they do try the stairs, they're short of breath, they're huffing and puffing, okay?"
"So, then we've got some history, so that's all part of the workup."
"Well, of course. These patients all have had routine EKGs. They've had obviously lipid profiles. And obviously if there's anything more, we go on further, maybe get some further imaging, echocardiogram or in some cases, a stress test, so whatever needs to be done. Because when someone is short of breath, okay, so I explain to the patient, look, the first thing you come in and you tell me you're short of breath. So, I'm thinking about, well, this could be a cardiac situation because, shortness of breath is, at least in the short term is less lethal than having being shortened of breath from a cardiac point of view. So, we have to make sure that's not the case. So in that case-"
"Okay. Well, okay, so then the patient goes through-"
"Okay. Say we have a patient who has a positive stress test. Okay, so something needs to be done. They may need a catheterization, so on, so forth. So obviously these patients are referred to a cardiologist. If those interventions are required, then that's done."
"Well, okay, so the patient, again, who I diagnose COPD with the spirometry, well, then we initiate treatment."
"No, I mean as far as a pulmonology referral, it's very rare."
"Okay. Well, first and most common of course is hypertension. Number two would be hyperlipidemia."
"Well, again, because the comorbidity there would be cardiovascular disease. "
"And both of these things, both hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or cardiovascular disease."
"Well, also peripheral vascular disease. So I ask a patient, can you walk? Well, okay, do you go for a walk every day? No, I can't walk so far because after I walk a block, I get leg pains. Well, okay, so then we think of that."
"Well, so I refer to the cardiologist because the cardiologist is going to be an interventional cardiologist. So, if the patient needs a catheterization, well, obviously I don't do that. So catheterization will be done. And then the patient returns to me for follow up and for maintenance and so on."
"Absolutely. No, absolutely. The patient is not handed over. It's a shared thing. The cardiologist will make that diagnosis. And then the patient comes back and I continue to see the patient."
"Well, remember, number one, generally speaking, these are not asthma patients, the COPD patients. So these patients are, they're not young. They all have comorbidities of one sort. Remember I said 90%. That is certainly something, that's the first thing. And that would be the first comorbidity, because this is what goes with COPD and heart disease are very closely connected."
"Known, wait I'm sorry. What percent have known risk factors? "
"Okay. Well, okay so I'm going to say probably about 30%."
"Yeah, of course. So in other words, these patients are being monitored for two things and we monitor for their COPD and also for their cardiovascular status."
"Well, okay. Assuming that they've had a proper cardiovascular workup and we know that they may have chronic heart disease, but if it's stable, then the most common thing would be hypertension or hyperlipidemia."
"Yes. Renal disease. Of course, remember some of these patients are diabetics or they've had untreated hypertension for years and so many of them will have renal insufficiency. Now renal insufficiency is again, that's a contributor to coronary heart disease."
"No, concurrently. Remember the patient comes in and I don't say well, okay, today, I'm going to monitor your COPD and well, next visit we'll talk about the heart disease. No, they have both problems they get monitored at the same time."
"Again, we have to be sure that there are no drug interactions."
"Well, yeah. I mean, sometimes for example, a patient has comorbid cardiovascular disease. So they may be on a beta blocker. Now some beta blockers are worse than others, as far as their interaction with COPD. Some of them can exacerbate COPD so you have to be cognizant of that."
"All right. That's an excellent question. No, I keep them somewhat apart. In other words, so look, if a patient is with cardiovascular disease and they're on LAMA/LABA, and if they're comfortable, they're not using their rescue inhaler and they're able to exercise and lead a good quality of life, then that's fine. Now, obviously, if there's an exacerbation or something like that, or if it's not adequately controlled, then we go on to triple therapy"
"Yes. Cardiovascular increases, it's been shown to increase the risk for increases in COPD morbidity and mortality and vice versa. A patient without severe cardiovascular disease, once they have an exacerbation of COPD that increases their risk for cardiovascular complications."
"Okay, all right look, in my experience that the cardiologist isn't too much interested in the COPD. They focus on what they do. So if the patient say has an arrhythmia, let's say the patient has AFib. Okay, it depends on their kind of AFib and the heart rate and so on, so forth. So a lot of this, they're on anticoagulants and then they're being treated say for rate control. And so if they need further therapy, if they have an uncontrolled heart rate, so something like that, then the cardiologist can help that. Say they cardioversion, well, then that's again, that's what the cardiologist does."
"Well, I mean is the patient a respiratory? Yes. But the patient is essentially is referred to the cardiologist, when that is necessary. When it's not necessary, the cardiologist will say he's your patient, treat them, whatever."
"No in fact, very often the cardiologists will tell me, listen, how is this fellow? I know he has COPD how is he doing on that? They have no suggestions to that. They stick to what they do."
"Okay, all right, a good question. Usually, you stick to the comorbidities that they have. And usually I am the one who will stay and remind the cardiologist that and also so this patient is say being treated with triple therapy for COPD."
"Of course, because then again, you run the risk of drug interaction. So this way, the cardiologist understands what the patient is being maintained on, what COPD drug, the medicines is he using, so he can consider that when he makes a recommendation. Or in the case of any kind of procedure that he wants to do, it's very important that they know the pulmonary status."
"No, of course they're related. Yeah, because what happens again, so patient is COPD but then what happens, it also increases their risk for the heart failure. "
"Yeah, so what happens untreated COPD rapidly can become low output congestive heart failure. So no, of course it needs to be considered. They have to be considered together."
"Sure. Because as I said before, patient who has an exacerbation increases their risk for cardiovascular complication by many times. I think it's like 6, 10 times something like that. It's much more than most people believe. So, they are definitely not isolated comorbidities, they're intimately linked."
"Well, okay, yes that's true. Now, particularly if a patient has shortness of breath and should we say okay, and the shortness of breath, well may not be pulmonary, maybe it's cardiovascular."
"Sure, well it does. So, someone has chronic congestive heart failure. Well, these people can be chronically short of breath. So, when the heart failure is managed better or is better controlled, then obviously a patient's shortness of breath decreases."
"No, you were just talking about the shortness of breath because of cardiovascular disease."
"Look, it may not resolve it completely, but it's going to help."
"Sure. Yeah. That's true, that is very true. Particularly the patients who have either congestive heart failure or incipient congestive heart failure, for one reason or another, maybe they're not so compliant with their medications, perhaps diet whatever. But yes."
"For, sure. Because again, it puts a stress on the right side of the heart so there's no question, it contributes to congestive heart failure."
"Okay. And respiratory related. So, I see very different results here. The cardiac related deaths in the LHS trial are lower. The cancer deaths extremely high compared to the others. So they're not really all the same. And yet when we go to uplift, uplift has the highest percentage of respiratory deaths. So, I'm not quite sure what to make of this."
"Well, yeah no it's true. I mean, it goes along with what I know. The only comment I was making is that these studies have markedly different results."
"Yeah as far as the text, that it says up to 39% due to cardiovascular causes, that's absolutely true."
"Yeah, because when someone has even moderate COPD that increases their risk for cardiovascular death for sure."
Increase the burden. Yeah. Excuse me  inaudible 00:32:00  this means. This is all-
"Well, the sentence at the top, COPD people have a twice greater risk of having cardiovascular diseases. I think maybe it's even more than that, but it is much, much higher. I think what this points to clearly is that anyone who is diagnosed with COPD needs to have a thorough cardiovascular workup."
"No, this is what I do. I mean, if someone has COPD, well we have to make sure that the cardiovascular is okay. You know? Many patients don't understand that. Don't understand that this is a very significant comorbidity."
"No, in other words, so if you're employing that, so any patient on who might diagnose COPD I refer to cardiologist no, of course not."
Absolutely. They get worked up coronary disease of course.
"Right. That's a good question, okay. No well, not necessarily. Look, say someone is a patient say who has been active, a never smoker. Who's had no respiratory symptoms. Do they need to be worked up for COPD that needs  inaudible 00:35:04  they need this and that? I don't think so."
"Okay. In other words, these patients, well, it depends if they have a risk factor for it, if they have some symptoms, if they have ... It depends on the patient, depends on the lifestyle. It depends on the smoking history. These are the things that would make me do, look, if they have a smoking history, they have a sedentary lifestyle, then I would consider working them up, even if they don't have significant symptoms."
"But most of these patients, you can tease out the symptoms, with a careful history this can be done."
"No, because these are synergistic. Definitely no."
"Goes beyond the lungs. Well, it sure does. 40% increase in the risk of stroke with, what is this?  inaudible 00:36:43  MI doubles. Yeah, no this is what I was alluding to before. Someone has even a moderate exacerbation, their risk of vascular disease, whether it's cerebral vascular disease, cardiovascular disease goes way up."
The risk of MI or the risk of a stroke goes up. 
"If someone has a complication, has an exacerbation of COPD the risk for both of those things goes way up."
"What? I'm sorry, just repeat that please? I don't, I don't understand it."
"Why? Well, okay. So, COPD puts a strain on the cardiovascular system clearly, right? Because these people they're not getting proper oxygenation, so they're not getting good tissue perfusion. And so consequently the brain and the heart suffer."
"Well, yes it does. That's an excellent question because most people would say, well this happens with severe. Yes, severe we understand that. But actually it's important as an educational principle to understand that this happens even with moderate exacerbations. Because most people think exacerbations has to be really, really severe and so on and so forth, but it does not. And I think that's really the takeaway from this slide."
"Causes mortality in LAMA/LABA, okay. Well, yeah, sure does. 48%, 49% risk reduction. Yeah, okay, that looks good."
"Well, okay, so although I have a question here. So product X, now we're talking about a LAMA/LABA patient who is well controlled or not well controlled, so that they don't state. In other words, so if someone, as I said before, if I have a patient who's on LAMA/LABA and is perfectly content, does not need rescue inhaler, when we come back I say, ""How many times in the past month?"" He says, ""Zero."" And so the question is then I don't know why I would increase to triple therapy. So I don't think anything has shown that in patients who are really well controlled on LAMA/LABA, that we need to go to triple. Of course, what the implication is, is that many patients on LAMA/LABA are not so well controlled. They may be moderately controlled, they may be using rescue medicine, say a few times a week, which is not great control. So those people can benefit for triple therapy."
"Well, as I said, one question is not answered here, is this for LAMA/LABA patients who are well controlled or not well controlled?"
"In other words, it's difficult for me to answer that, as I said. In other words, the patient on LAMA/LABA who never has to use rescue medicine, okay, will he get that 49% benefit? I don't know."
"Yeah, then I agree, then this is important and these patients should be on triple therapy."
"No. The only thing is again, I would clarify this slide by saying that these patients are not 100% controlled."
Well the difference between the treatment arms here? I don't-
"Actually, the graphs actually begin to separate very soon. In other words, you don't have to wait months here for this to separate. So, it seems that the addition of the steroid really makes a difference right away. So this is an important thing and these patients who are not controlled are at an increased risk for mortality. And by changing them to triple therapy, we actually decrease that risk a lot."
"The majority of mortality difference between ... Okay. Yeah, again this all makes sense, with what we've been saying, this fits in just right."
"Well, the difference between cardiovascular death is quite dramatic and again, so too the respiratory death and COPD death. Yeah it's better all down."
"Well again ... So, there's obviously less of a difference in the respiratory death as a whole because remember you have ... Well probably because of the pneumonia, because that seems to be about the same, you know? So in other words going to triple therapy does doesn't seem to actually reduce the risk for pneumonia. It goes off, wait a minute."
"Actually wait a minute, no I just looked at that wrong. No, the risk of pneumonia is down, so it helps with everything."
"Okay. Yeah, so pneumonia death actually are lower."
"Okay. Well, yes, wait all cause deaths, okay. Yeah because also, yeah respiratory deaths don't go down quite as much because probably the pneumonia or whatever. But it's all cause death, that's who we're talking about and in which case-"
"Well, okay that requires some more thought. I think, well, remember respiratory, you got pneumonia under there. So pneumonia differs by it lowers a little bit, but not as much. And COP probably my guess would be, is because the mechanism of COPD is already there. So these drugs they treat COPD and lessen the cardiovascular burden, they improve the quality of life and so on. But as far as actually altering the course of the disease, they actually don't."
"Yeah. So let me see, okay. So cardiovascular death. Well, it certainly cuts down the cardiovascular death, but  inaudible 00:50:08  talking about product X of course. And let's see The non fatal. No, it's makes a huge difference, yeah."
Showed a reduction of cardiovascular disease versus-
"Okay. So in addition to the 49% reduction in mortality, it also reduced 62% reduction in cardiovascular deaths. I see, yeah, again, quite striking."
"Yeah, actually that is quite a significant number, 62% is ... That actually means that we have to ... So look, the bottom line here is that anyone who we suspect is not really, really well maintained on a LAMA/LABA certainly needs to progress. "
"I think what happens is that a lot of these patients maybe, they may be started on LAMA/LABA and they just keep using it because get the prescription refilled and so on without being thoroughly evaluated to see what's happening."
"Well, the benefit is huge. So, when indicated, it's clearly, it's something that it's not question of an option, it's a question of this is what needs to be done."
"Well, I believe I'm doing this right now, but it motivates me to be absolutely sure that anybody who's on LAMA/LABA is 100% controlled. So if they're not 100% controlled, then we need to step up."
"That's right. I mean, it would be yes. No of course it is. Of course. Because also you see, this is another thing stepping up from dual to triple therapy is actually very easy because there are no side effects, it's very easy for the patient. There's no essentially, you're not increasing the medication burden. So the device will contain three drugs instead of two, that's it. I mean, in other words, there are no side effects involved. So in other words, actually the patient doesn't even know if they're taking two or three."
"Yeah, so it also makes it very acceptable. So I say to the patient, we're going to go up to this, three steps. So what does that involve? Well, not much."
"Okay well sure. Whenever you have a single device, I mean, look, a couple of things are obvious. First is that compliance is assured, I don't have the other inhaler. I ran out of one, not the other. And I didn't have both with me, I don't really like using two devices, so all of that. It seems is when you use the three in one it's things seem to work better. "
"Than a combination, than a mixed combination. Look, single inhaler is always better than, for example, look if you have something, if you have say hypertension, that's been control by two medications, well you're going to get a better control if it's a single combination medicine. And that's true with anything."
What? I'm sorry with comparison between what?
"Okay, all right, product Y yeah well sure, because in product Y you've got different devices, you've got two devices and then again in product X, you've got the single device. So, of course that has to be better. Because the other thing too, is that these inhalers, whichever system it's using, it needs patients still have to actuate these things properly. And some patients actually, no matter what the device is, they, they're not a 100% either comfortable or they don't do it properly. Which is why I have them bring their inhalers periodically so I can actually watch them do it and make sure the technique is good. Because people they tend to sort of forget and get sloppy in the techniques."
What? You're saying that product Y is a single device?
"I see, okay. No, I see what you're getting at. Well then clearly, then obviously one is a little bit better."
"So, I think now that could be for a couple of reasons. It could be the character of the device, it could be the deposition in the lungs and that can vary and can also be with patient technique."
"Yes, no I see that. So on the left, it's the risk reduction in the study, so yeah, I'm familiar the EMPA trial and so on that with the SCLC twos. So they all have significant risk reduction, but you know, as you can see ... So, I'm not quite sure what you're getting at."
"Yeah. No I see there, it's the risk reduction with actually, well obviously product X is much greater."
"Well, it reinforces the fact that if we get COPD better controlled with a triple therapy, it really reduces cardiovascular risk and reduces it by a lot."
"Yeah, the connection is not entirely clear. Just say it again, please?"
"No, it's actually not only is it validating, but it's extremely compelling. "
Yeah. It makes it even more compelling than one would realize. 
"Well, it's that COPD and cardiovascular disease are intimately related and the risk of morbidity, mortality go hand-in-hand."
"Well, I'll have to be 100% sure with a cardiovascular patient, 100% sure that the COPD is again, 100% controlled. And as you mentioned earlier, so with the cardiologist, they're not that focused on this and that may be also to reinforce in my dealings with the cardiologist that about the COPD control. And I think the cardiologist actually knew needs to be aware of that."
"Yeah. In other words to make the conversation more than by the way, Mrs. Jones has COPD. No, it's not a by the way. See, that's the point."
"Well, in other words I'd be more likely to escalate to triple sooner."
"Nothing. No,  inaudible 01:04:31  I mean, it's going to be the same device. "
"I don't use multiple devices. So it's really not, it'll be a different brand name or some this and that, but as far as from their point of view providing it's covered by insurance, there's no issue. "
"And which usually it is. And if it's not, we get it covered. So that's, that's not a problem."
"Wait, so it's muffled. Just say it again, please?"
"Yes. Because it shows actually that risk reduction here, when we get some risk reduction for COPD and look, because it's always been drummed in that, well look we give statins,  inaudible 01:05:59  SCLC twos and so on and to achieve cardiac risk reduction, but are we achieving and also make sure we achieve the really good risk reduction we can get by optimal control of COPD?"
"No, that's fine. No listen you're very interesting. Your questions were very thoughtful and I appreciate it."
"Sure. I'm part of a two man private practice of pulmonary and sleep medicine. I've been in practice for 21 years. We are a nearly 100% outpatient practice in an urban location of the Southeastern United States. See a lot of bread and butter pulmonary medicine. My patient demographic is middle to lower middle class and I would say that about 20 to 25% of my practice, being a community pulmonologist, would represent C-O-P-D."
"Pretty much as it's described in the GOALD guidelines. Perhaps somebody who was on dual therapy and needed a step up in therapy because of increased rate of exacerbations or perhaps a step up in therapy due to increased symptoms. And perhaps on a rare occasion, sometimes a patient might come in de novo, naive to therapy, and we diagnose them with really quite severe C-O-P-D, and they have a history of hospital, one severe exacerbation, or maybe two moderate or less. I might start them on triple. That would probably be   00:03:13 "
"Moderate exacerbation, I believe is defined as basically outpatient therapy, an outpatient exacerbation that would perhaps be treated with a round of oral corticosteroids. Severe would be either an ER visit, or more likely a hospital admission for an exacerbation."
"Yes, that's kind of what I just did mention. If a patient comes in to the office de novo, naive to therapy, new diagnosis, history of maybe had a hospital admission or has been having multiple outpatient exacerbations, I might start it."
"They both are...it's nice to have them. Obviously there's differences, subtle differences in the profiles. The Trelegy being once-a-day, dry powder inhaler. The Breztri being twice-a-day in a traditional meter dose inhaler. There's some additional efficacy measures in terms of reducing exacerbations that Breztri has that Trelegy does not."
"Gosh, I don't remember any. They might have mentioned something to me about mortality. I don't know that it's statistically significant. It might be like a secondary endpoint kind of situation."
"No, it stopped in the video. Everything stopped.   00:08:11 ."
"""Mute all sounds."" And then what about ""unmute attendees?"" What do I do with that?"
"It's been a while since I've seen the rep face-to-face and gone over the detail piece, but to my memory, it's very similar to what I've seen already. And as I've said, this is some data that I don't believe Trelegy has. And so that was kind of what I had mentioned when you asked me up at the beginning."
"No, I think it's not new news for Breztri, though Breztri is relatively new itself."
"Oh, no, it's very credible. They couldn't present it to us if the FDA didn't allow him to do it. So it's pretty credible."
"Again, it's not new news to me, it's certainly some strong support for using the product. I can't speak for everybody in my field, but that data about exacerbations is not new news. Right? It just speaks to the importance of using, of preventing exacerbations and thus the need for using a triple like Breztri."
"Yeah, no, it's a relative risk reduction, but nevertheless, it's still statistically significant. It's only versus LAMA/LABA, but still it's data that the competitors don't have. I think, at least for me, whenever I treat a patient for any disease, it's always the best efficacy measure that somebody could put in front of me is mortality data. It rarely happens, so it's really nice to have."
"Yeah, absolutely. Again, because the competitor doesn't have this kind of data, the majority of patients that we're putting on the triples are the ones that are high risk that are at risk for exacerbations. And so yeah, my use has been steadily increasing for that reason."
"Yeah. Particularly in those patients where they come back after having an exacerbation on therapy, that's really, I think, where there's value in choosing this product over Trelegy, because the data's there. For a patient that I might be trying a step up, or just because of perceived symptoms, that's a very difficult thing they alluded to in the detail aid here, that sometimes having symptoms can be a marker of a risk for an exacerbation. My argument in that regard is unfortunately it's an incredibly subjective measure, and all of these patients are symptomatic and I rarely ever see a day where they're not or a visit where they're not. I think I might not necessarily use Breztri in a situation where I'm just...it's a patient that always complains and I'm stepping up therapy just to humor them, just to see if it might help with symptoms, but maybe not necessarily a true risk for an exacerbation."
"So the statistical significance of the 20% reduction in risk of hospitalization of Breztri versus ICS-LABA. So, reading through the lines... At the addition of LAMA therapy is what gets you that statistically significant reduction... Numeric reduction, but not statistically significant when you step up from LAMA/LABA to Breztri, i.e., the addition of an inhaled steroid... Kind of surprising. Honestly, I would've expected the other way around. It would be nice if it, to step up in therapy, resulted in statistical significance in both arms versus both of the two different dual meds, but nevertheless, there is some statistical significance."
"So different numbers. And again, it looks to be...oh, let's see here... Confusing. So if I look at the left side, ""down 64% in hospitalizations versus LAMA/LABA and KRONOS statistical significant, but not statistically significant versus ICS-LABA. And then ICS-LABA in ETHOS is significant."" Okay. Oh, I see what you're saying. So, they did two different studies, and in each study they were able to achieve statistical significance and step up in therapy against the other, the different tools."
"Okay. So I get that. Okay. So they kind of addressed that concern I had on the last slide, but yet on the other hand, they did the two studies and the opposite arm didn't achieve statistical significance in each study. But again, what are you going to do? It is what it is. Nobody else has data. So..."
"Yeah, I think so, because it would address that concern I had on the last slide. But someone who might be...if they were to read the fine print, might ask the question or raise the issue that I just did. Right?"
"Interesting. So that second... The bar graph on the right basically addresses this issue as to why it didn't achieve statistical significance versus LAMA/LABA. And it raises the issue that maybe there was an over tendency to admit patients to the hospital because that can be skewed based on medical, legal. I understand that. Our institution... I always say that if you're a C-O-P-D patient and you show up to the Emergency Room and you look at them funny, they're going to admit you to the hospital. And so this kind of addresses that issue and raises the question as to what, that may have been the reason for why it didn't choose statistical significance in the LAMA/LABA arm.   00:23:53  Very good. You know, very good."
"I think I find a lot of value in this too, because we don't sit around in a detail and ask what the number needed to treat is. And so having it kind of presented right to you is helpful. Makes it easy."
"No, yeah. I mean it's like subgroup analysis really and yeah, I do. I mean, I think it addresses an issue where a doctor might bring up, raise a question as to why it didn't achieve statistical significance against both tools."
"So if you can... I think what I'm getting at is I'm comparing the data on the left side of the slide to the right side, and the left side of this slide there's the bottom bullet point, there's not statistical significance. But on the bar graph versus LAMA/LABA, is this statistically significant reduction?"
Yeah. I think they're raising the question as to whether regional practice differences were the cause of that.
"Yeah. I mean, it might require...it might raise some questions from practitioners, but it still would, I think it would address... If I were only presented with the data on the left, I might ask about a second bullet point. Why, would be my question. And then if you present it in another way, well it does. And I guess it... Ultimately if they use this, the rationale that it may be due to regional practice differences, that might be explainable."
"Yeah. Again, maybe someone might find some criticism in the bullet point, but I do like the fact that the number needed to treat is just kind of presented-"
"Okay, so I'm comparing them all to this one?"
Actually I would say yes to all three. I'm good with them. All of them.
"Oh, so I got... In each column should be a one, two, and a three?"
"Increases urgency to treat H-A, H-B, H-C in order   00:28:47 "
"I gotcha. I think that I like B, H-C is the first, H-B is second, and H-A is third in terms of increasing urgency. Yeah."
"And I would rank them the same for ""motivates me."" I think, ""differentiates from other close triples,"" I'd probably put, H-B is one, H-C is two, and H-A is three. Sorry, it took me second to kind of grasp the concept."
"Again, relative risk reduction and risk of all-cause mortality versus a dual LAMA/LABA."
Okay. Could I see the original? I'm trying to-
figure the   00:30:46  Okay. So it's the wording? In the-
"The way it's worded, the bold face, I think it kind of sends a stronger message."
"You know, it's saying the same thing, but with the less wording, and maybe the way it's worded is a little bit, I don't know, a little bit more stronger statement. And the bullet, I mean the bold face, makes it a little bit of a stronger statement."
"I think that the wording, this wording is even better. It's still fairly succinct. So the term that they use is prevention. Prevention, or prevented, is a real...has a strong connotation to it. The bold face again, strong, strong message, honestly, best of them all."
"I'm not understanding the cardiac protective treatment studies, but commenting on the triple therapies? Yeah. I mean, the argument that they're trying to make is, and it makes sense and sounds like the data supports it, that if you're going to prescribe triples to achieve some of these endpoints, you're going to achieve them with a higher likelihood of success in a closed, a fixed dose triple versus an open, because of all the, in the different devices, the multiple inhalations the data one's going to achieve, you're going to lose compliance."
"And so, yeah. I mean it's really good data because the argument could be made well, ""I could, why can't I prescribe triple therapy open?"" Right? Well, here's why. Again, I don't, I'm not sure I understand what's going on with the cardiac protective treatment studies that estimated in order protection."
"I don't understand the graph on the right, what they're trying to achieve or what, what that's... Oh, I see. I know risk reduction. I see. I see, it's the statement on the bottom right that explains the cardioprotective treatment studies."
"Yeah. I mean, it's good data. It's a good, I think it's good data to show, to support the use of the product."
"So alt M-B, I think we would give ones in the  inaudible 00:35:22  column, alt M-C two in the whole column and original  inaudible 00:35:31 ."
"Again, this just highlighting, what the subsequent risk of, for a patient of having an exacerbation. Again, well known in my field, but it's...that's why we treat patients, so it's good to comment on it."
"Yep. Kind of says the same thing, different, different illustration, but I've seen similar illustrations. Not exactly the same, similar though."
"Yeah. I mean, it's kind of like a snowball effect in a way, it's like a downhill cascade, if you will, where exacerbation just kind of continues to lead to a downhill spiral."
"So am I comparing it to the last one? Or just, just in general?"
"Yeah. I guess that there's more to preventing exacerbations than preventing exacerbation. There's other endpoints that one can achieve by reducing exacerbations other than... I should say, there's multiple endpoints to achieve by preventing exacerbations."
"Actually saying the same thing in a different way, without any illustrations, a new statement with the third leading cause of death and remains on the rise, that's new, a new statement compared to the one previous ones you've seen. Right."
"It depends on which ones you're having me compare. I'm sure you'll show me. Compared to the past two, I'd probably like this one the least. It doesn't really have...there's no illustrations at all."
"No, but I mean, I find that sometimes the illustrations create a more impactful, are more impactful than-"
"Oh, okay. Oh, just the way it's worded. They're just looking...yeah. I mean, I don't know. I found the wording on the other ones was more impactful than this one."
So I would say that alt U-B is not an improvement.
"Well...yeah. I...yes, I believe they are."
"So I would say that I like alt U-C the best, and I would put that alt ones and all that in that whole column. I would do alt U-D second, original U the third, and alt U-B the fourth."
"So very straightforward, just 52% statistically significant risk reduction in Breztri versus LAMA/LABA on a numerical 18% reduction in, reduction in exacerbations versus ICS-LABA, but not statistically significant. A very clear message with a very clear illustration to support it."
"So part of that previous, it leaves out the lack of statistical significance versus ICS-LABA, and it now includes number needed to treat. So, yeah, it's good. I mean, it might, the question is, is it fair to leave the other stuff? I don't know. I like this a lot because it really, the addition of the number needed to treat is helpful. I guess I would have to make some decisions in the context of what else you're about to show me."
"Yeah. No, it wasn't on the other slide. So now you're showing kind of all positive data, no negative data, nothing for anybody to question."
"Yeah. It's basically the same data, it's literally the same as the first, the original, with less illustrations, less bar graph. In my mind it almost says the exact same thing, short of the illustration. I think the illustration actually helps."
"Oh, I think every piece of information that's presented to me, I can't...it's going to be...it's like a unique situation, but for something like this, I found that that illustration was, it really did help support the point that they were trying to make. So I found it, that it was more helpful to include it than to leave it out."
"For this particular point, I do believe it. It is helpful."
"If you want me to slow down, let me know."
"So I would put, yeah, I think E-C for sure in my mind. Again, all positive information, I would make that alt one. I like the original E as second, so I would make that  inaudible 00:45:53 . And then E-A is my least favorite of all."
"I understand the point. I find it... I have a hard time. It might just be me with these, the graphic on the right. Sometimes I find those can be hard to understand."
"Well, I just have a hard time understanding the illustration on the right. That's just..."
"I don't know. I mean, I just don't understand it. I find it hard to grasp, but I can't explain to you why. I mean, I understand what they're trying to say, but I don't know how the illustration supports that."
"I guess ratio. Yeah. I just find the whole thing confusing. I don't know. I mean I think I would ask for just some sort of more straightforward explanation of the concept, the point that they're trying to make."
"Yeah. The companies that try to promote triples have in a way, in my mind, tried to kind of overstep a little bit what the traditional measures that we use to make us, or to prompt us to prescribe triple therapy from a step up from dual, rather than it being truly a concrete, objectively defined exacerbation. They traditionally, they've found ways to show, to suggest to us that we should be stepping up therapy for symptomatic patients, or I find this to be another one of those situations where it's not like clearly defined in the GOLD guidelines that you would use that as an objective measure to step up therapy to triple. And so to me it's a little, it's... What's the word I'm looking for? It's marketing."
"Well, the traditional measures would be symptoms or exacerbations, unobjectively defined exacerbation. Now they're talking about things that aren't reported by a patient. I mean, there's no objective documentation of that at all. Right? How would you have ever be able to objectively define that?"
Okay. So I find...so now I'm starting to understand what they're trying to say. I think that this-
"This is a little bit more well explained. So, in essence, they're, it's a... Now I'm understanding what they're trying to say. And so that makes more sense. They're trying to basically say, look it, a patient doesn't necessarily have to have a history of exacerbations. It doesn't have to necessarily be prescribed in a patient with a history of exacerbations to prevent exacerbations. You can broaden, broaden the target patient population."
"And it is pretty well defined that these patients, the more severe they get, the more likely they are to exacerbate even in the absence of a history of the exacerbation. So it's all fair. It's all fair statements. Yep."
"Well, given that I kind of got a chance to choose what I like. Yeah, I mean, I find it more compelling even because I did change a lot of them. And so, I mean, I would bump up the two sixes to the sevens. I mean, again, competitor doesn't have this, this data."
"I think each slide, I mean, if we can go through them and...they're, like for the original U, that you can achieve additional efficacy measures, endpoints, if you will, by preventing exacerbations with Breztri that go above and beyond prevention of exacerbations. It does prevent exacerbations versus LAMA/LABA. Number needed to treat is three. It prevents hospitalizations. And these numbers are all statistically significant. There's a statistically significant relative reduction in death rate, albeit it's a small percent number from, what is it? 2.6 to 1.4? But still, and then the number needed to treat to prevent one death is one, or 80. Right? So, yeah. I mean, it's... All in all, these are certainly unique points."
"Sure. I'm a pulmonologist in a suburban area. I work mostly 60 to 70% office, 30 to 40% hospital. I've been triple boarded in internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine. Probably 400 patients a month. About 250 of those are COPD and another 100 are asthma."
"The other 50 to, I don't know, 450 patients. The other 50 to 100 are a combination of pulmonary arterial hypertension, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic cough, pneumonias, bronchitis, assortment."
"Yeah. About 20% mild. About 40% moderate. Where does that leave me? At 40%. And out of that 40%, 25% to 30% severe, and the other 10 to 15% very severe."
"So, I start with a LAMA alone. Go up to a LAMA/LABA, except for patients who have that asthma COPD overlap syndrome, which is maybe 10% of my population. They start on a LABA/ICS. And then from either a LAMA/LABA or LABA/ICS, a triple would be the next."
"A couple of things. Can be frequent exacerbations, can be symptoms above and beyond even when they're on the dual therapy."
"Yeah. So, pretty basic. It's a history and physical examination. Chest X-ray and spirometry."
"So again, it depends on the history and the physical. If the patient's having chest pain, I'm going to be looking for cardiac disease. So, they'll get at least, an EKG in my office and a possible referral to a cardiologist."
"If they have cor pulmonalium exam, if they have an RV heave, if their EKG shows right heart strain, if they have Edema. They're getting at least an echocardiogram, if not a fuller cardiac evaluation, but those are done at my handy dandy cardiologist across the parking lot, not in my office."
"Well, it depends what you mean by cardiovascular disease. Are we talking an arrhythmia? Are we talking ischemic?"
"So, if a patient has active ischemia, if they need a cath and a stent or something like that, the cardiologist becomes involved. If they get a stress test that's abnormal, the cardiologist does initial management."
"Obviously the cardiologist is doing the stress test, the cardiologist, if they need it, is doing the cast. And if they need a stent, that's the cardiologist as well. Once that happens, the only thing the cardiologist does is occasional monitoring for the stent."
"Or if their testing was negative in terms of ischemia, then they just send them right back and they want nothing to do with them. So they say, ""Send them to me in a year so I can do more expensive testing."" But they don't do any management. It's only if they're stenting and needing to do things."
"So now, I generally go from the screening spirometry that I did to a complete set of pulmonary function testing. Now, if I think the patient has asthma, if I do the pulmonary function testing and they have completely reversible disease, I'm not doing complete PFDs."
"Right. So once I've determined they have COPD, then they're getting a set of complete pulmonary function testing. Because want to see real lung volumes, and I want to see reversibility, and I want to see their diffusing capacity."
"In anyone who has a smoking history, I am doing a screening CAT scan looking for nodules. That's the current recommendations. Anyone with that smoking history gets that. And that's really all they need."
"They get oximetry at every visit and if there's a question about low oxygen, if they have cor pulmonale, they getting overnight oxymetry. Otherwise, they're just getting a sitting oxymetry, with or without a six minute walk or an evaluation for de-saturation."
"So sinus disease and rhinitis, because that's imminently treatable. Acid reflux because that affects their reflux, affects their COPD, causes exacerbations. So it's important not to miss that."
"And then cor pulmonale. Do they have right heart strain from their COPD? Because that is an indication that you need to look to see if they need oxygen. And then coronary artery disease, because not everything that's shortness of breath is pulmonary in origin."
"If you walk into my office, I take ownership of everything I'm on. I don't trust everybody to do their job except if... People are busy and our office is very, very accessible and I wind up having people call me for their urinary tract infections because their primary's not answering and can I do it? And I'm not exactly sure what everyone does during the day, but they don't seem to be taking care of their patients."
"Yeah. Again, it's such a vague generality. So if I have someone who comes in and they have COPD and I have no suspicion of cardiac disease, I'm not thinking about cardiac disease. If I then I'm treating the patient, I get them on inhalers."
"Everything is all coming up, roses. Everything looks beautiful and they're doing great. Their breathing tests are great but they're still short of breath, I'm looking for a secondary etiology."
"So, I get their breathing test markedly improved and they're going, ""That's great doc, but I still get short of breath with activity,"" I'm looking for another cause. So at that point I'm either looking for cardiac disease or I'm looking for thrombo-embolic disease."
"If the patient has arrhythmias, that's a much more problematic thing than cardiovascular disease. Because with arrhythmias, you have to be careful when you're using LAMA/LABAs combined."
"So you can usually easily get away with either a LAMA or a LABA. So, if you're using a LABA/ICS, or if you're using a LAMA, it's very rare that, that is arrhythmogenic. Even in patients with arrhythmias. But when you start to use the LAMA/LABA combo, if I gave that to you, you'd have no problem."
"But when you give it to a patient who already has atrial fibrillation, whose doctor is having a hard time controlling their heart rates and stuff, and then you're giving them two medications that will tend to increase the heart rate and can be proarrhythmic, that's problematic. And the cardiologist go bananas when we do that."
"So, that's the thing we deal with. But in terms of ischemic disease, it really is not an issue. The LABAs have warning labels about causing increased hypertension and an increase in heart rates."
"And we preseparate about that, but I can't think of any patient in the past 10 years that I had to stop a LABA because their blood pressure was high or their heart rate was high. It's one of those things that we talk about, we perseparate about, but it really has not, for me, been a significant issue."
"Yeah. Proportion, per risk factors, essentially all of them. Because they're older, they tend to be more sedentary because they've got significant lung disease. But it's really hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes that are the main risk factors I think about."
"But you're asking me interesting questions because I don't approach this like a general intern that's going, ""Ah, they have high blood pressure. They have high cholesterol, must be cardiac."" Because I'm not checking their cholesterol. I'm not doing those labs. That's being done by their primary care doctor."
"They're being referred to me specifically, because they're short of breath or they're wheezing or they've got an abnormal X-ray. But they're not being sent to me because they think they have cardiac disease. And to me, the biggest thing is someone sent to me their doctor thinks they have COPD."
"They think they have asthma because they're short of breath or because they smoked or because they're wheezing. None of them had the ability to do X-ray in their office. They have to send them out to a radiology group, and none of them have spirometry at all."
"So a lot of them being sent to me really to get spirometry and see what the heck's going on with their person. So, my first thought is always their COPD and COPD management. But in the back of your mind, you're always saying, ""There's something funny about this,"""
"And it's not a specific thing. It's like, ""Wow, this patient's not acting like they should. They haven't gotten better like they should. I've just improved their lung function by 30, 40% and they're still saying they're short of breath."""
"Normally you improve it like that, and people come back and they're like, ""Oh my God, why didn't someone give this to me years ago? This just changed my life."" And then there are people who come back and go, ""Ah, I'm still short of breath."""
"Yeah. It's not even something I think about. You're asking me as if this is something relevant, but it's really not something I ever think about. Other than when I'm making my choice of inhalers in the setting of arrhythmias. But in terms of the   00:18:31 "
"Right. And the question is, why should it? Why would it? It's like when patients say to me, ""Oh, I've heard about inhaled steroids. They can cause osteoporosis or they can cause cataracts."" And it's like, ""Yes. Yes they can. But do you want to breathe? Or are you..."" Everyone gets the   00:19:09 "
"Not at all. So, when you're treating a patient, for me, the algorithm based on goal guidelines and my personal clinical experience matches GOLD guidelines very much. So start everybody on a LAMA. LAMAs work wonderfully, you get dramatic improvement."
"The only thing you have to worry about is to make sure they don't have underlying close down glaucoma, and that they don't have issues with urinary retention. And then it's basically safe in everybody. And most people will come back in and say they're significantly improved on that."
"Now some of them will come and go, ""Yeah, I'm somewhat better, but I'm still having issues."" And then I step up to a LAMA/LABA. And sometimes that step up is after a few weeks. And sometimes it's after month or years. But that's the next step."
Exacerbations have nothing to do with cardiac disease.
"Nothing to do with it. Exacerbations are driven by the weather, the pollen counts, the sediments in the air, the pollution, respiratory infections, but they're not driven by cardiac stuff."
"All the time. The referral is way more from them to me. And that's because they get someone referred to them for chest pain or shortness of breath with activity. They do their mega expensive work-up, including a stress test or a nuclear stress test plus an echocardiogram. Then they throw their hands up and go, ""Not me, must be pulmonary."" And they toss them our away."
Correct. Pulmonologists tend to be super internist and maybe because we're intensivists as well. But we tend to wind up becoming the doctor for most people.
"I don't see them as interrelated at all, other than the risk factor of smoking. If you're smoked, you're going to get COPD. If you're smoked, you're going to get cardiac disease. That's about as far as it goes."
"Because, I don't really think they're interrelated. I see the gist of your conversation today is to try to make them related, but I don't see them that way. I see them as two distinctly different things with some underlying risk factors, mostly being smoking history."
"I see it more interlinked in terms of cor pulmonale and right-sided heart failure, which the cardiologists go, ""Oh, look. They have pulmonary hypertension, send them to pulmonary."" Then again, if it's on the right side of the heart, it's not something they can put a stent in."
"They're not interested other than they get to do a year early echo. So that could dump to me to figure out it's a primary pulmonary hypertension, or is it secondary to their COPD or their hypoxy or their ostial lung disease. So they go, ""Oh, look, they have this tag."" It's very much  inaudible 00:24:22 "
"No. So patients always come in with COPD and say, ""Doc, can I exercise and make my lungs better?"" And the answer is no. Lungs are not a muscle. Lungs are a sac of cells that you damage by smoking all those years, but your heart pumps blood to your lungs and that's what oxygenates it."
"So getting in good shape, increasing your activity level, improving your cardiovascular status, will improve your dyspnea. And deconditioning is a huge problem in COPD patients, because they tend to be sedentary. Deconditioning in cardiac patients is a huge problem. So improving cardiovascular activity level, making your heart more efficient, does make you breathe better."
"But it doesn't change your PFT, if they don't improve your lung function. But they can make you breathe better. Because if you're a fat lump sitting on your couch who can't breathe, and you get out, and you start walking, and you lose some weight, and you start to walk, and get cardiovascular health. Yes. That will improve your dyspnea, but it doesn't improve your COPD."
"Cardiac and pulmonary diseases cohabitate. They're common diseases that occur commonly in the same patients, and 40% of people with COPD died of cardiovascular causes. They're not COPD deaths, I think that's a mislabeling. That's just saying that very frequently people who are smokers have cardiac disease and they die of their cardiac disease."
"And that makes sense. People don't die of COPD. If they have mild or moderate disease, they die of their COPD from severe disease. So that makes very good sense that the deaths are less pulmonary and more cardiac in origin."
Most of my patients don't have severe or very severe lung disease. They have mild and moderate lung disease. They're not going to die of their COPD. They're going to die of cancer. They're going to die of cardiac disease because that's what kills you.
"Okay. Individuals with COPD have two times greater risk of having cardiovascular disease than those without COPD. Again, I think that speaks to them being smokers. I'm not a smoker. I am not going to have COPD and I may or may not have heart disease depending upon my genetics, and my cholesterol status, and my diabetes status."
"But I'm not a smoker and a smoker increasing cardiac risk. So I think this reflects smoking history more than anything. And to say that people who have COPD die more if they also have heart disease, ischemic disease or heart failure, make sense. Since as I keep saying, my mild and moderate COPD patients are not going to the die of their lung disease. They're more likely to die of heart disease."
"So that makes sense. Now, when you look at the cardiac alone, that's more interesting. Because Martha, if my theory is correct that it's a concurrence due to smoking, then you would not expect people who have pulmonary disease for that to increase their mortality, but their cardiac disease should be the driving force."
"Because I keep saying their lungs are not what's going to kill them, for 60% of patients. So I think what they've isolated here is the people who have bad lung disease. So that 40% or so who are in the severe and very severe category and those people are going to have a higher risk of dying if they're in that cardiac disease standpoint. Does that make sense to you?"
"So what I'm saying is in my COPDers, since 60% of them, their disease is not what's going to kill them. In the last 40% they might die of COPD, they might not. But they very well might. Those people who are smokers and whatever are more likely... The 60% who are not severe disease, I don't think are going to die of their COPD."
"It'll affect their life, but it's not going to kill them. Those people are going to die of cancer or heart disease or heart failure or whatever. So having that cardiac disease is going to increase their risk of mortality. Totally get that. But when you think about that, so if you buy my premise that 60% is not going to die of pulmonary disease, that pulmonary disease shouldn't affect them."
"So what I think this is reflecting is that people who have ischemic heart disease or heart failure, who have severe COPD, are more likely to die. And that's that increased mortality. So you're overlapping to high risk health issues. And that is what I see-"
"I can tell you clinically, that all the time I get called from the ER about an admission and the patient is a COPD exacerbation slash congestive heart failure. That's their favorite call. And the reason why they call and say that is when someone comes in, and they're short of breath, and they're wheezing, and they have COPD, and they're in some heart failure, it's impossible to know."
"So I do think in patients who have more severe disease, the concurrence of ischemic heart disease, and more importantly, heart failure really compounds it and it doesn't necessarily increase the burden of COPD, but it increases the burden of mortality and morbidity in that they're more likely to wind up in the hospital."
"They're more likely to bounce in and out of the hospital. Yeah. It Increases the mortality because they have two really bad diseases. But that really occurs more in the people with the more severe disease, is what I'm saying."
"Yeah. The part versus CV alone speaks to me. Because for COPD alone, I go, ""Yeah, you can have both things."" And the heart's going to kill them, not the lungs, if they don't have severe disease."
"But then when I look at the other, I start to think, ""Yeah, I do see an awful lot of those patients who are both COPD exacerbation and heart failure."" Not so much ischemic heart disease but heart failure, in the hospital."
"Not necessarily surprising, but it just makes me go, ""Oh yeah. I wasn't really thinking about that when we were talking in the beginning, that wasn't my focus."""
"Yeah. The increased risk of stroke and heart attack after moderate exacerbation does imply the fact that a COPD exacerbation that the inflammatory component is not just in the lungs being inflamed, its ischemic. With that said, they're saying the risk of an MI doubles within five days and a 40% increased risk of stroke within 10 days."
"That's pretty damning information, but I don't see that clinically. So I see moderate exacerbations in my office, probably 10 to 20 a week. We're constantly giving out steroids and antibiotics for moderate exacerbations. And the definition of the moderate exacerbation is they need steroids and, or antibiotics. Severe exacerbation is they need to be hospitalized. So, when I-"
"Again, what I'm trying to say to you is, if you said, ""Is this true for severe exacerbations?"" I would say that in my hospitalized patients, I see a dozen MIs a year, and maybe two dozen strokes a year. Is it within hospitalization or right after?"
"Yeah, it might be. But when you talk about moderate, and that's my experience with my office patients with moderate exacerbations, and I'm treating hundreds of those a year. And I am seeing half a dozen MIs a year, and maybe a dozen strokes a year."
"It doesn't fit with what I'm seeing. And I have a huge COPD population. So I understand that this is data you have. I don't know where this data was generated, where it was published and blah, blah, blah, but I don't believe it."
"And if you said it was after a severe exacerbation, I'd say, ""Yeah. I definitely see more patients hospitalized with both or having more while they're in the hospital or wherever, but not  inaudible 00:36:49 "
"Okay. So time to all cause mortality, on or off treatment, secondary endpoint, LAMA/LABA, cumulate incidence of all cause, mortality, ICS/LABA, product X, reduction mortality VS a LAMA/LABA, a 49% reduction in death, all causes verse a LAMA/LABA. To a nonsignificant versus ICS/LABA inhaled to combination of... Okay."
So I look at this and so if it's a triple product it's presumably Trilogy or Bradstreet. Those are the two triples that are currently available. I am familiar with the fact that there have been some reports of decreased mortality with triple therapy.
"And I think it is more in the severe to very severe, than it is in the moderate. But I can't be sure because I don't know the data from this. But the interesting thing is the NNT, the number needed to treat. 80 patients is going to save a life, is basically what this is saying."
"Now for a primary care doc AD COPD. They may only be treating a hundred COPD patients, it's their thing. But in my office where I'm seeing 250 a month, that's going to be several saved patients out of my monthly group. And that's interesting data."
"Yeah. We'd love to see things where the number needed to treat is five or 10 or 20. 80 is a lot for a primary care doctor who doesn't do a lot, for a pulmonologist who is doing a thousand COPD's patients a year. That's a lot of decreased risk of all chords mortality. So that is an exciting piece of information, assuming I can see the real data."
"No. I'm curious because the study says it's a phase three study of moderate to very severe. So I would love to see how that breaks down. How much of this is moderate. How much of it is severe. Because basically, I have a lot of patients on LAMA/LABAs who I have not stepped up to triple therapy."
"Because they're not having exacerbations and they're not having symptoms. Which are the two indications to step up to a triple therapy based on GOLD guidelines, based on the clinical data that I've seen from the triple compounds to date."
"It might push me to push people over to triples earlier. So depending on what the data actually shows, the difference between a LAMA/LABA and a triple is adding an inhaled corticosteroid. What the inhaled corticosteroid adds in risk, is the possibility of oral thresh."
"The possibility of respiratory infections. The possibility of cataracts and osteoporosis are the main risk factors that they attribute to an inhaled corticosteroid in general. So, that's when you step up. You think these are the things, is this an for this patient."
"And the answer is, it's not an issue for very many patients at all. So why do we not step up? We reserve it for the appropriate patients. But if I can say to the patient, ""Hey, you're going to have almost 50% decrease in mortality. If I switch you over."" Then people are going to go, ""Hmm. I want that."""
"That would be a big selling point. They don't want to know the number needed to treat. They want to hear that 49% reduction in mortality. ""Ooh, that sounds big. Let's do that stuff."""
Okay. So it's a one year study. Can you go back to the last slide?
"Cumulate index of all cause mortality, 1, 2, 3. Okay. I thought it was saying three years, but it's saying cumulative incidents. Okay. Cardiovascular  inaudible 00:42:42  a majority of the mortality treatment differences for product X versus LAMA/LABA who were instead of major adverse cardiovascular event."
"Okay. So all cause total. So this substantiates the fact that the inhaled corticosteroid is the beneficial factor. And the reason I say that is because the ICS/LABA data and the product X data are similar. The cardiovascular causes are the same. The respiratory causes are the same. The COPD causes, the pneumonia causes, the cancer causes, are similar."
"So when you look at the all cause total, it drops from 2.4 to 1.6, if you're using a LAMA/LABA versus an ICS/LABA. And when you go to product X, it drops to 1.3. That is very interesting and exciting data. And I think that information would certainly make me think about switching to triple therapy earlier."
"And non-fatal MIS, non-fatal strokes and cardiovascular deaths. And the thing that's interesting when you look at it, is the LABA/LAMA patients. Without that, ICS really stands out in total. In the non-fatal MI and the cardiovascular deaths. Although not in the non-fatal strokes, which is interesting."
"So it's a phase three randomized double blind multicenter problem, moderate to very severe for 52 weeks. So, that's one year data. That's very interesting. What I would like to see is the breakdown of the severity of disease to convince me."
"Because if the breakdown leaned towards severe and very severe, it wouldn't persuade me in the moderate patients, but more in the more severe patients. So that breakdown will be very important for me."
Yeah. So this sticks to my guns of what I said initially. People with mild and moderate COPD are not going to die of their COPD. They're going to die of something else. So the fact that they're dying of cardiovascular stuff is not at all surprising.
"The question is, does the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid decrease the cardiac deaths in that patient population? And this data suggests it, but until I see the breakdown, I can't say. And again, they only did moderate or severe."
So did it work in mild patients or is it only when they get more severe? And how are they defining moderate and severe COPD? So the primary endpoint was moderate or severe exacerbations.
"And the question is, when they put people in this trial, in patients with moderate to very severe COPD, did they define that just based on FEV one? Were they defining that on exacerbations? Where were they doing that? It's an interesting question as to how they've done that."
"In the old days, we used to use the GOLD guidelines used to do stage 1, 2, 3, 4. Mild, moderate, severe, very severe. But now they have this GOLD, A, B, C, D that includes exacerbations. And they don't really call it mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, although pulmonologists still do. So the question is, how did they define that?"
"No. It exemplifies the fact that it was predominantly cardiovascular deaths that were affected. And I think that's a good secondary thing to put on there, because it's pointing you to... Not that there was a all cause mortality decrease, but it really was primarily cardiovascular deaths."
"So it's not like it was decreasing cancer deaths or something. It's very intriguing data, very intriguing. And I really want to see this study. Is this an already published study or is this a, about to be published study or not yet published study?"
A magnitude of ARR for mortality and single inhaler triple  inaudible 00:49:09  Okay. What the hell is ARR?
"Okay. So the first thing is you should never put on the slide, absolute risk reduction abbreviated as ARR. Because nobody knows what that is."
"No. And I looked at that at the bottom, but if you're trying to make me jump out of my seat and say, ""I want to give that."" I shouldn't have to go look up what ARR is."
"No. I understand that, but this is for your sponsor. Never put something like that in a header if you want to get the attention of a clinician. The magnitude of absolute risk reduction for mortality in single inhaler, triple therapy studies is similar to that observed in landmark cardiovascular trials. Okay."
"So statins, ARNI, angiotensin receptor, inhibitor versus an ACE, ACE inhibitor versus placebo, and in diabetes, diabetic medication versus placebo. And then product Y and product X. So product X is one company and product Y is a different company?"
Except the previous handout was just product X and there you through in product Y right.
"So that is interesting, in that the competitive product has, perhaps not as robust, but it has very similar efficacy. So, that's impressive. So the question is, should you throw an inhaled corticosteroid on every cardiovascular patient decrease their risk?"
"No, it's very... When I looked at the initial studies, I said, ""Wow, this is very intriguing, very interesting."" And the fact that it's similar to these other trials just substantiates what I said before. Is this is significance in impressive data."
I just want to see which population they actually studied this in. How much was moderate? How much severe? How much very severe? Because that would guide how I treated a patient. It did not do mild patients.
"Absolutely. Depending on the breakdown, at the very least, it would support putting all your severe and very severe patients. It might also suggest putting your moderate patients. And will this become the standard? That we're going to get rid of the LAMA/LABAs other than patients who are steroid phobic."
"And in those steroid phobic patients, if you tell them, ""Well, you may not like oral steroids, but on principle, because it's a steroid, but it'll decrease your chance of dying by 50%,"" they may change their tune."
"Perhaps. This suggests that airway inflammation in some way, shape or form, increases your risk of cardiac death. Because by treating airway inflammation with an inhaled corticosteroid, you're decreasing cardiac mortality."
"So that certainly suggests there is a more significant link between airway inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Or that independently, an inhaled corticosteroid is decreasing cardiac death through another mechanism."
"So obviously, at the beginning you asked me what percentage of my patients are on triple therapy and it was already, I believe, 40% or more. But a lot of those patients are on combination triple therapy. So they're taking an ICS/LABA plus a LAMA separately."
"Because they were taking that for years before it was available or because they like one device or they had problems with the combination therapy, or in a lot of people, the insurance didn't cover the triple therapy. So we had to break it up."
"So the question is when they see this data, will insurance companies now allow it in those people? Will they lower the cost of it? Because it is prohibitive for a lot of patients. And that's why a lot of patients are not on it."
"And what they didn't do in that study was to look at if I have the person on an ICS/LABA and I add a LAMA, what we call an open triple, does that have equivalent benefit you would think it would?"
"So you're wondering, could you just continue what you're doing or do you need to change the system, or do I need to switch to a closed triple?"
"Are they going to share that... is someone going to do that study to show it's better? If I were the pharma company for Trilogy or for Bradstreet, I would want to do that study just to show my drug is better than the other drug or my drug is better than an open triple."
"Because right now there are a lot of people on open triples. I want to capture that market. I would try to prove that I'm better. And the last thing is, I really need to see that breakdown. Because if that breakdown shows it's just as effective in moderate diseases as it is in severe disease, I would tend to go to that early in my moderate disease rather than going to a LAMA/LABA."
"What's interesting is if you had talked to me 12 years ago, every patient was on a LABA. LAMAs were just available, but the LAMA/LABAS didn't exist 12, 15 years ago, whatever it was. And everybody was on CereVens or Forail. Now, I don't even know if those drugs exist."
"I certainly have nobody on them anymore, because everybody is either on ICS/LABA, or on LAMA/LABA. And the answer is the LAMA/LABAs could disappear if the triple therapy is found to be that impressive for moderate disease and decreasing mortality."
"If it really only starts to do the benefit in the more severe disease, the LAMA/LABAs won't disappear. So that to me, is the sticking point as to whether I would progress earlier."
"Sure. So I'm a imaging cardiologist, general cardiologist in a mid-sized metro area in the Midwest of the U.S. It's a very large community hospital so we do tertiary care. We don't do quaternary care, so we don't do transplants or LVADs or things like that. But we are a referral center for a large series of smaller hospitals. So I do you about maybe 70% outpatient, 30% inpatient work taking care of a wide variety of cardiac issues, but obviously including heart failure."
"Yeah. I mean, it's almost 50 / 50. It's probably 55 reduced 45 per no, wait, what am I saying? Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's probably 55 reduced 45 preserves."
"I know that's the nomenclature, I don't personally... I guess when I talk to patients I talk to them about how they have a more favorable prognosis, but in my notes I have to be honest, I don't necessarily write mid range or anything like that."
"I mean, I think that they're very different, actually, not in terms of necessarily the patient population, but in terms of comorbidities and presentations and recovery. So in my experience, patients with HFpEF so preserves, it's mostly because of uncontrolled hypertension or arrhythmia, or early diagnosis of an infiltrative myopathy with the reduce though we see a lot of viral cardiomyopathies. We see a lot of alcohol induced cardiomyopathies, drug induced, and just, I guess we also see some hypertensive cardiomyopathies that are just burned out, but I just feel like it's a little bit more of the infectious toxic etiology rather than long ongoing comorbidities."
"No, not necessarily. I mean, patients who present to us, I mean it's hit or miss. I mean, we have patients that present to us all the time in the hospital with pretty significant heart failure symptoms, and then you do an echo and they have either preserved or reduced, like you can't necessarily tell just by looking at them. I guess if you held my feet to the fire, I'd say that patients who come in severely volume overloaded, where they have tremendous lower extremity edema and it's pitting and they're just, you know they will typically have a terrible EF, but I've heard some pretty terrible lungs and people needing BiPAP or high concentration oxygen and respiratory supportive therapies, and they have preserved ejection fraction. I don't know that I see a tremendous difference in presentation to be honest."
"Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, no difference. These patients they present with trouble breathing and so if you take it slow, they're only going to have continued trouble breathing."
"Yeah, I'm simplistic I just try to aim for 50% or above is preserved for me. I know there's some of the research papers have 45%, but for me, it's 40 to 50 is that mid range below 40 is reduced and above 50 is preserved."
"Well, I do think that they are distinct with the exception of say infiltrative cardiomyopathy. So hemachromatosis or amyloid or Fabrys or something like that, where preserved you're just catching them earlier in the natural history and if you didn't diagnose them appropriately, or if they fell out of care or lost a follow up, a couple of years down the road, they're going to have reduced. So for them, I think it's a spectrum, but for a lot of patients, I feel like preserved is a different beast than reduced. It's not a spectrum. They're different things."
"So, as I said, I think that preserved is more of a function of the comorbidities, uncontrolled atrial fibrillation, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, for example, I think that these, you know it wasn't necessarily a problem with the underlying myocardium. It's the action of the comorbidities upon the myocardium and that's preserves, but for reduced, I think it's actually a primary problem with the myocardium being as I said because the muscle, you know the myocytes were killed off because of alcohol or weakened because of a virus or something along those lines."
"I think the incidence of infiltrated myopathy is on the lower side and then the only other condition, well, I shouldn't say that. I mean again, if you leave atrial fibrillation uncontrolled for a long time, they're going to start to weaken out. But that reverses once you correct the AFib, I guess it's the only other major one that if you leave completely uncontrolled for a long time and it will transition over time from preserve to reduced is going to be hypertension."
"Well, the biggest needs I think are targeted therapies, right. We really have none that are primarily indicated for preserved, but also I think it's just the socioeconomic contributors that leads to this stuff. It's the diets, it's the lifestyles, it's compliance with medications, it's affordability of medications that I think certainly in my opinion, that's what leads to people having exacerbations of preserved."
"It's not unique, but I guess I don't know that I've ever seen a thin vegetarian with preserved ejection fraction, wait with heart, you know with HFpEF. But I have had thin patients with reduced because they got a viral cardiomyopathy or something else along those lines. So I do think that preserved is a little bit more the result of lifestyle, obesity, diabetes, that kind of stuff, than reduced is."
"Oh, you know something, I didn't catch that. They were both in the last two years. I didn't-"
I didn't realize that there was a request for a discrepancy between those. So I apologize.
"Yeah. So this was a guy who was referred to me for a primary for shortness of breath with exertion. He had fairly poorly controlled diabetes, inadequately controlled hypertension. He was obese, not like... I don't think it was BMI like greater than 35, but it wasn't greater than 45. So it wasn't morbidly, morbidly obese, but right so not well controlled diabetes, not well controlled hypertension, obese and shortness of breath. And so of course we started with an echo and saw that he had preserved LV function, but he had pretty elevated left atrial pressures and what we termed to be diastolic dysfunction."
"We also did on this guy I think we did a stress test if I recall, or did we do a calcium score? I think we did a stress test for this guy that showed that he had no ischemia. So we felt comfortable that his shortness of breath was not anginal equivalent. And so we presumptively diagnosed him with HFpEF on the basis of that."
"Well, I mean, there's no blood test or genetic testing when it comes back as yes or no. So at some level everything's a little bit presumptive."
"I didn't rule out that he had chronic pulmonary emboli as the cause of his short... I mean, there are some potential other things that you could say could have been doing it, but I was fairly confident that in a guy with fairly uncontrolled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension, obese with his symptomatology with elevated left atrial pressure by echo and with no evidence of ischemia. I'm pretty confident that that's... and he didn't have crazy pulmonary hypertension or anything. So I think it's a pretty reasonable diagnosis, but we did not certainly an exhaustive evaluation of other causes of shortness of breath."
"Yeah, you could do a cardiac MRI, I suppose, but I don't know that I would do anything else for this guy based on his age, based on his demographics, things like that. I don't know that I would do anything else."
"Oh, comorbidities I missed that. Sorry. No, I think it's very important. I mean if this person did not have diabetes, did not have hypertension, was not obese did not have AFib or really anything else and came with shortness of breath and only had left atrial pressure... elevate left atrial pressure on echo. I think I'd want to dive a little bit more down into figuring out why they had shortness of breath, why they had elevated left atrial pressure. I'd want to know a little bit more, maybe I wouldn't be satisfied with the stress test and I would want to do a CT angiogram maybe I'd want to... I'd probably go ahead and do a cardiac MRI in that circumstance to make sure that he didn't have an infiltrative issue. Maybe go for PFTs to see if we're just barking up the wrong tree and it's not cardiac at all, if the shortness breath is not cardiac at all."
"So I think the comorbidities are important because, what do they say? You know, if you hear hoof beats, right you think horses not zebras. And so if the guy has a clinical situation, that's very consistent with heart failure, with preserved ejection fraction, I don't know that you have to start looking for other things, but if you don't have that clinical scenario and you don't have reasons for why they would have HFpEF, I think you do have the responsibility to look."
"No, because I have patients who just have hypertension or who just have obesity, or I guess obesity alone is not always the case, but I certainly have patients that just have hypertension or just have diabetes and could have HFpEF, but certainly when they're combined and they're not well controlled, yeah I mean it's much more likely."
"So, I mean, we could talk about average, but we could talk this specific patient, as I recall, had been having symptoms for a couple of months, but had only just recently seen his primary finally to try to figure out what was going on. The patient himself had not acted on the symptoms for a while."
But it wasn't like the primary was muddling around trying to do things.
"You know for several visits over the course of a year before they finally sent to me, that wasn't the case, the primary sent right away."
"At some level again, I think it's just a comment on how patients care for themselves, right. Patients who have fairly uncontrolled diabetes and fairly uncontrolled high blood pressure, they're not the ones who are quickest in to the doctor anyway. I mean, obviously because I mean otherwise their blood pressure and diabetes would be better controlled. So they're not really involved in their own healthcare anyway and so that's why they take a little bit longer before they present."
"I mean with this specific primary he doesn't do much of a workup, he just refers. Sometimes they'll order an echo and maybe a BNP maybe, sometimes they'll order a troponin in the office and then they'll refer so that those things are at least done. Sometimes I'll just do those things, see the results and then think about referring. But this specific primary usually just refers right away."
"Most common is the primary ordering the echo. We have a pretty easy way to get echoes and we don't have long delays. So I think most commonly the primary will order the echo, get the result and then refer,"
"Now that I'm saying that out loud I don't know if that's the case actually. I think,   00:20:37  I apologize. Now that I'm thinking about it, I really think they probably just refer, I mean, most primaries in our system, they have faith in the cardiology team, so they just refer."
"No. I mean a patient with diabetes, who's obese, who's male, who's middle aged. I'm definitely thinking also could this be ischemia? So I think we have to do an ischemic evaluation."
For this guy I'm pretty sure we did a stress test and an echo.
"I guess I don't like saying standard, but again we don't do the same thing for everybody, but yeah that's as close to standard as you could probably get, I think that's a pretty common grouping of tests."
"That's a good question. Well, sometimes we'll do a CT coronary angiogram, so that's just a cat scan instead to look inside the coronary arteries to see, I guess it just depends on level of suspicion. If you also add in that they're a smoker or that there's a family history, I think I'd be much more likely probably just to go straight to it, it might, I don't know, it also might just be what mood I'm in that day, I suppose, to be honest, I mean, they're both really good tests."
Then sometimes if somebody also has any other concerning symptoms or if they've had a cat scan in the past that shows heavy coronary calcification or something like that I might just send them straight for cardiac cath and then we could do a right and left heart catheterization and get a full set of human dynamic data while we're at it. So it's kind of a range of things that we could do.
"Yeah. So again, if I don't have an obvious cause of their HFpEF right, if I think that they have HFpEF but I don't see an obvious cause I'm going to do a cardiac MRI there. If there's something on the echo that makes me suspicious, you know the appearance of the muscle texture or abnormal strain patterns or abnormal wall motion abnormalities, things like that that make me think of whether it you know sarcoid or amyloid or hemochromatosis or one of these things Fabrys maybe then I'll go ahead and order the MRI at that point."
"Yeah, it's just such an easy cheap test that I don't, there's really not, it's rare... I can't think of a patient that I would get an MRI before I get an echo, frankly."
"Yeah, as I said before, I just think that he had enough other comorbidities that it just made sense that I didn't know that it was necessary to go to that step."
"If there was LVH, but no history of hypertension I'd want a cardiac MRI, if, as I said, they had an abnormal strain pattern, if they had apical sparing or something like that, I'd want a cardiac MRI, if they had, as I said if they had regional wall motion abnormalities that didn't add up to necessarily coronary territories I'd want a cardiac MRI. If the patient didn't have diabetes or hypertension at all and just have elevated left atrial pressure I'd want a cardiac MRI."
"So the opposite is if they have normal strain pattern and normal wall thickness and normal contractility and they have diabetes and they have hypertension and they have all these things and I'm just not seeing anything, you know any red flags in the echo. I'm not necessarily going automatically to the next step of the MRI."
"Oh, for sure. Yeah. They're all   00:26:49 ."
"Not necessarily. Well, yeah. I mean, it depends. I mean, most of these we will report out their diastolic function assessment, right. So we'll report out what grade of diastolic function that they have. And whether we think that they have elevated left atrial pressure in these things, and we'll report it out as grade one, grade two, or grade three diastolic dysfunction, or we'll just report out there is diastolic dysfunction, or there is not."
"Most primaries I think will read that if they see a patient with shortness of breath and you're reading out that they have grade three diastolic dysfunction or abnormal  inaudible 00:27:47  or one of these things, oftentimes they will send those patients to us then as a result of that."
"We have primaries of different levels of confidence in their own ability to manage things. So we have certainly primaries that do everything on their own or try to do as much as they can on their own. And then we have primaries that say, no for anything, just go have the cardiologists take care of it."
With HFpEF it's probably 80 to 90% are diagnosed by cardiology.
"Yeah. It's a little dicey, when you tell somebody they have heart failure, I mean, that's a pretty loaded term. I mean, most people don't understand like what you're talking about. They just hear failure of the heart and that sounds like a pretty awful term, frankly. And so I think you just have to... mostly I just honestly, I just walk them through like you know the heart does two things, it squeezes and relaxes, squeezes and relaxes, and you have a problem, not with the squeezing, but with the relaxing that your muscle fibers are stiff. They're not as flexible as they should be. That's because of diabetes, high blood pressure all these kinds of things. And I said these are things we have to work on to get your heart functioning better."
"Not always. Honestly, I mean, I'm sure you understand there's varying levels of healthcare literacy-"
"Amongst the patient population, there's higher functioning better understanding the patients out there that you can use those terms, HFpEF but I would say that a very large proportion of my patients with HFpEF if they were watching news a news report about HFpEF, they wouldn't say, ""Oh, that's me."""
"Or if they saw a newspaper article with the headline of HFpEF or heart failure preserved ejection fraction, they're not like, ""Oh, that's me."" But if you tell them that they have, I don't know, adrenocorticotropic like cancer and they see that as a headline they're like, ""Oh, wait, that's me. That's my cancer."" Right? They would you know like different... or if a woman is reading, watching the news about breast cancer and she has breast cancer, she knows like breast cancer, okay that might be about me, even though there's different kinds of breast cancer. But I don't, thinking about this, I don't think that most of my patients with HFpEF if they were listening to a report about it they would identify like, ""Oh, that's what I have."""
"I do use the heart term heart failure, but honestly, with patients, I don't say you have what's, you know I might say in the beginning you have what's called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, but it's not like I pound it in every visit talking about it, where it becomes a term that they identify with and recognize."
"Maybe that's a failing on my part, I guess. I don't know."
"I mean, I don't think it's any different."
"The majority of my patients come in alone, they don't come in with a family member."
"This patient? If I recall had been on metoprolol tartrate for blood pressure and they were on an ARB for blood pressure as well if I recall, I think they were on Losartan as well for blood pressure, but just not at an optimal dose. So if I recall we changed this patient to Toprol or metoprolol succinate, increased the ARB and added the spironolactone."
"Oh yeah, but that's a different beast, right?"
"Entresto, I mean as far as I'm aware, didn't have any efficacy in HFpEF."
"But I mean I guess you can correct me if I'm wrong, but EMPEROR preserved, which was the trial that looked at HFpEF was a negative trial. It was a neutral trial so I'm not really in favor of prescribing a really expensive therapy to a patient with no benefit other than blood pressure lowering, because there's plenty of blood pressure lowering drugs that are generic. I try my hardest to be a good custodian of my patients finances."
"It's a work in progress it's evolving over time, but it's depending on how the patient presents and I guess frankly how bad their HFrEF is. I'll either start it first off or I'll get them on a beta blocker, ARB and aldactone. And then once they're stable on that, we'll talk about upgrading the ARB to the Entresto."
"Yeah. Well, I mean the SGLT2 inhibitors are promising, so I've been using more of those for HFpEF patients and then I'm going to spironolactone a lot earlier in the treatment algorithm because I believe that they are specifically beneficial in HFpEF as well."
"Yeah. Any patient, obviously if they have diabetes that's an added bonus, because again whenever, you know as a doctor it's always hard to convince patients to take more medications, to add on more and more medications. By nature everybody is just reluctant I think to be on more and more, even if you tell them it's going to benefit them, it's a minority of patients that say, ""Give me everything you can that make me better."" Most people want to keep it as concise and reduced as possible."
"So it's nice to have added reasons to put somebody on something. So even though the SGLT2s have an equivalent benefit independent of the presence of diabetes, it's nice if the patient has diabetes, because then you can make the argument, ""Well hey, Mr. Smith, not only is this really good for your heart, but it's also going to help your diabetes too."" And so that's just an added reason for a patient to go on it."
"And sometimes it's nice because you can say, ""Hey, Mr. Smith, how about this? It will stop your glipizide, your sulfonylureas and we'll put you on this medicine that does two things instead."" And so that's a nice thing, that is an added bonus for patients with HFpEF and diabetes is that you can use that to make a better argument or a more convincing argument for them to start another medication, even if it might be expensive."
"I mean, probably it works out that way, frankly it's not my intention. I mean, I try to use it even if they don't have diabetes, but as I said I think I'm more successful with getting patients on it if they also have diabetes. I think that would be the statement."
"Not really. I mean, I'm trying to do a better job of thinking about it for every HFpEF patient because I think it's really shows like, I mean, because again, the data suggested it really is beneficial."
"No, I said I think I just realized that I had said EMPEROR preserved for Entresto, but it's not, that's the Jardiance trial, it was a paradigm. It was the Entresto trial. So I said the wrong trial earlier. That's all."
"Oh, as I said, I told you earlier I just explained that this is a problem with the relaxation of the heart, that the heart is less flexible, it's stiffer and that we need to try to enact therapies and treatments that are going to give it an easier time relaxing so that it can fill more efficiently and be able to squeeze out."
"Yeah. I mean, yes. You just have to... this is, we are working to get you better."
"Making sure your diabetes is better, making sure your blood pressure is better, is going to help your heart muscle. These are the kinds of things we talk about. Yeah."
"It really has to be kind of a comprehensive approach. I spend a lot of time also talking about nutrition with these patients and compliance and all these things because I said, ""We could put you on all the right medications, but if you're eating terribly, it's not going to make a difference. Your heart's not going to get better."""
"Huge. Yeah, as I said I literally can't remember if I've ever seen a thin vegetarian with HFpEF. It's just people who are focused on eating healthy are eating a naturally low sodium diet who are taking care of themselves don't usually develop HFpEF."
"Great. Oh yeah I do a lot of, in addition to being an imaging cardiologist, I do a lot of preventive cardiology. So I spend a lot of time counseling, nutrition and patients honestly start as being very shocked about the contribution of nutrition, but when they start making some changes and they start seeing benefits, they buy in pretty quickly."
"I give them a handout with some, what I call our five simple rules about what they should try to avoid in their diets. And I say be conscious of sodium and aim for 1500 milligrams a day, understanding that's going to be very, very hard depending on what you're eating, but just try to be conscious, start reading labels and aim for 500 milligrams per meal, which again is going to be very hard, but just try to start being more conscious of it and aim for it."
"In the beginning it's every three months until we get them stabilized and on the right path, and they've made some lifestyle changes and they're more compliant with their medications. And then we start once they're stable and doing well, we see them twice a year at that point. But oftentimes we stick with every three months and sometimes we see them back in a month. I mean, if their blood pressure or their diabetes is really uncontrolled we'll just see them back in a month."
"And I'll either me or one of my nurse practitioners will see the patient back just to do really functionally, a compliance check. ""Hey, how's it going? What changes have you made? How are you doing? What's your blood pressure look like? How are you tolerating the medications? Do we have to get any labs?"" That kind of stuff. So we might see them back as soon as one month, but probably typically it's three months on average."
"These patients have bad prognoses. I mean, HFpEF is not a benign prognosis, these patients have mortality. I think studies have shown that their mortality is basically equivalent to HFrEF. And so I wouldn't want to just put them on some meds and say, ""Okay, go back to your primary."" Because I just don't, I mean frankly there's a reason that they weren't taking their meds in the first place and primary obviously wasn't, I'm not trying to blame the primary, but the primary obviously wasn't able to crack that nut or solve that problem of getting them to be compliant with meds and being on the right meds so that's where I come in."
"Certainly untreated versus in my practice are different things, but certainly untreated, multiple hospitalizations each time with never getting back to their previous baseline function and probably something like 30 to 40 percent significant morbidity or mortality within certainly two to three years, I think."
"It all depends on how compliant they are with the treatment plan. If they're eating better and they're on their meds, it's extremely rare that they have an exacerbation. If they're on their meds, but they haven't changed their diet at all. Yeah. Every time they go out, every Super Bowl Sunday or the Monday after Super Bowl they're reporting that their short of breath or if they had a family reunion or they went out for fast food or something like that, and they had it a couple nights in a row then they'll be calling us saying, ""I'm having trouble breathing, Doc."""
"No, it's not always, we do rotations. And so sometimes I'm in other locations and my partners cover my in-patient duties on some days and I cover theirs on other days. So I don't always see my patients with exacerbations, but we try to."
"I'm sure as you know, HFpEF is really a clinical diagnosis, so we're just asking clinically, how are you feeling? How are you sleeping? Do you have orthopnea, are you exercising? How do you feel when you're exercising? When you're exerting yourself, are you feeling better? You know, all these kinds of things. That's how we're checking. And I don't always do repeat imaging, if the person says, ""Yeah, I'm feeling better. I'm able to walk further. I'm no longer having trouble breathing when I lay down."" These kinds of things that we don't jump into imaging again."
"I mean, we might do an echo on an annual basis, you know kind of roughly on an annual basis, but not always. I mean, again, if they're feeling well and they're doing well, we don't do an echo, but if they're still struggling a little bit, we might do one just to see is this the patient who's actually degenerating into HFrEF? Or is there something else going on that we didn't catch the last time? Is there valve a little bit worse? You know, who knows?"
"Yeah, I mean, again, left atrial pressure. I'm looking for is there evidence now of pulmonary hypertension from chronically elevated left atrial pressure or is there sleep apnea that maybe we didn't recognize and we can see because there's pulmonary... I don't know. These are the things that we'd look for."
"Yeah, I don't do that on an annual basis just for the sake of it. I sometimes think about doing it. I guess I do it for some patients, but I don't do it routinely. You know, maybe I should start. I don't know. It is a nice test. I mean, it's nice to get a baseline and be able to tell somebody where they compare to last year. I mean, it is nice. So I don't know, it's probably something I should maybe think about doing more."
"If they're still having some symptoms and I'm just worried that maybe it's something else this time, maybe it's some other pulmonary issue, I'll just check that and see, and if it's basically the same or better than it was last year, yet their shortness of breath is worsening or not then I'll do it for sure. But if somebody's feeling good and they have this history of HFpEF, but they're feeling good, they're on good meds. Their diabetes is well controlled. Their blood pressure is well controlled. I'm not checking their BNP just for the sake of it."
"They're usually seeing their primary too, but frankly once I start seeing a patient, I'm pretty much the one in charge of their high blood pressure. I'm in charge of kind of a lot of the things I think, just because historically how I practice and what I just... I think sometimes patients follow up with me more frequent than they do with their primary."
"And I'm going to be counseling them about their diabetes and I'm the one sometimes starting diabetes meds, like Jardiance or even Trulicity or Ozempic or some of these so sometimes I'm managing their diabetes a little bit more even than their primary is."
"I don't know, it's a good question. I don't know that I can think of one specific area that's really a glaring need other than as I said, targeted therapies and things that improve the kind of the socioeconomic contributors to somebody's health. I think if we can get patients to be more compliant, if we had some targeted meds or meds that have been proven to be helpful in this situation, and if we could work on their nutrition and their lifestyle and that kind of stuff, I think we'd be doing a pretty darn good job of treating HFpEF in this country."
"Again we don't have a blood test that says yes or no, you have HFpEF so if there was some kind of test or some kind of a guideline put up with the American Society of Echo that if they have this consolation of features or if they have this marker or this result, then that is for sure HFpEF, and we know that is linked to better treatment. If you start enacting these guideline directed medical therapies then yeah, I think that would be useful."
"No, it's add on, I don't think it replaces."
"Yeah, but as you know we don't have a lot of therapies that have been proven to have outcome benefit, spironolactone came close in, what was it, the top cat trial and Jardiance so that was  inaudible 00:53:28  So Jardiance showed benefits so I think that focusing on those two meds first is probably the right way to go. But most of these patients end up on the typical therapies that we are using even for HFrEF too."
"Yeah. A heart failure indicated beta blocker, you know ACE or ARB, spironolactone and SGLT2 inhibitor now."
"That's why it'd be nice to have specific therapies, specific for preserves."
"Yeah, I mean they may not be working as well."
"I can see myself in the camera, but I don't see you."
"That's fine. But the IT told me that, to start my webcam. That's why I'm on."
"Okay. So I'm with this group practice, family medicine working full-time for the past 23 years in a suburban community in North Carolina. I see family medicine. I see, yes, a white variety patients. A lot of them with COPD, especially since I'm in a tobacco state. Yeah. I see a lot of COPD patients on a daily basis. So very familiar with them, from me, adults to geriatrics alike, I probably see about 200 patients a month with COPD diagnosis, in various severities stuff from mild to moderate, to severe, to very severe, including those with instate COPD on supplemental home oxygen either only at night and at daytime as needed or 24/7 on supplemental home oxygen."
"Okay. So if patients are not controlled on my first drug of choice for control maintenance inhaler for COPD is a LAMA/LABA, really do I have monotherapy on LAMA first? Most of the time I start them on LAMA/LABA. If they're not controlled with LAMA/LABA, I add inhaled corticosteroids with it, or switch them to a triple therapy, we only have two triple therapy, which are one in inhaler right now, either trilogy or Breztri or Breztry."
"Yeah, but I have patients on separate inhalers, LAMA/LABA, and a separate ICS or an ICS/LABA and a separate Lama."
"Okay. Moderate exacerbation it depends on how long patients have been having the exacerbation and how severe they present. There's very little difference between the two, most of the time they present with the same complaints, shortness of breath,  inaudible 00:05:42 , increased cough for sputum production with it, wheezing. So if they're not controlled with the LAMA/LABA or ICS in a LAMA, for example, and they call the office. I tell them to call the office, if not, any better within five to seven days. And they continue to have persistent wheezing, especially chest tightness, shortness of breath, even at rest, not just on exertion then, yeah, they're classified as severe. If there's oxygen saturation, too, if there's desaturating on their oxygen saturation, again, depending on the degree of  inaudible 00:06:29  of their oxygen, then they can be severe, not just moderate, already."
"The difference, honestly, right now, since I've had more success with trilogy, the fact that it's been the first available triple therapy for months before Breztri became available. I have patients now that I've started on Breztri, but I still have more patients on trilogy. It all boils down a lot of times with what insurance covers. What discount cards or coupons I have available to start patients on."
"Right. Well, the frequency of dosing, the trilogy of once a day, Breztri twice a day, sometimes patients they would prefer... Some patients prefer twice a day because they feel like they're getting more of the medicines. If they do it that way, they get more relief with their symptoms."
"No, I have not gone into all cause mortality or anything like that. I'm not aware of any studies that have delve into mortality."
Okay. I'm ready. We just have the title right now.
"For symptomatic patients with moderate to severe COPD and at risk of exacerbation unleash the powerful protection of Breztri against exacerbations and reduction in the risk of death. The data show that it only takes one exacerbation to increase the risk of death. Just one exacerbation increases the risk of COPD hospitalizations by 21%. One in five patients die within one-year of their first COPD hospitalization. Further patients who experience an exacerbation are two times more likely to experience a myocardial infarction. Patients are at risk of exacerbations when they're symptomatic on current therapy, or have an exacerbation, even one requiring oral corticosteroids or antibiotics. Breztri Is powerful protection unleashed. Breztri demonstrated a 52% reduction in the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations versus LABA/LAMA. A 20% reduction in the rate of COPD hospitalizations versus ICS/LABA, and finally, a 49% reduction in the risk of death versus LABA/LAMA."
"Breztri is for patients like Mike, who despite being treated with an ICS/LABA are still symptomatic and at risk of further exacerbations, especially since he took antibiotics last winter. Breztri could help prevent Mike's next exacerbation, or COPD hospitalization and support his goal to lead a healthier lifestyle. Doctor, let's talk in more detail about the powerful protection Breztri delivers against exacerbations. Breztri reduced the rate of exacerbations by 52% versus LAMA/LABA and achieved a numerical 18% reduction versus ICS/LABA in KRONOS. For patients who fear exacerbations Breztri can offer added protection against moderate or severe exacerbations. Each of which is a significant event. Only Breztri has shown to powerfully protect against COPD hospitalizations versus ICS/LABA. You'll recall at the beginning of our conversation, I shared some relevant data about how just one hospitalization increases the risk of death for patients with COPD."
"That's why it's important to know that Breztri reduces the rate of COPD hospitalizations by 20% versus ICS/LABA in ethos. Doctor, with regards to mortality, the most important outcome in COPD Breztri showed a 49% reduction in the risk of all cause mortality versus LABA/LAMA, and a numerical 28% rejection versus ICS/LABA. One death can be prevented for every 80 patients treated with Breztri instead of LABA/LAMA. Doctor, for your symptomatic patients with moderate to severe COPD at risk of exacerbations, people like Mike don't wait to unleash the powerful protection of Breztri. Breztri delivers powerful protection against exacerbations and COPD hospitalizations and reduces the risk of death when taken two inhalations twice daily. Prescribe the power of Breztri."
"Yes, very powerful presentation. It gives you the overall decrease rate of hospitalizations, but it's been compared with LAMA/LABA or ICS/LABA. It's not compared with the other triple therapy. So yes, definitely. I agree with all of this, if it's head-to-head comparison with the use of LAMA/LABA. Yeah. Almost 30% rate of hospitalizations, all costs, death, mortality, and all that about 50% decrease compared to LAMA/LABA or ICS/LABA, and same thing with degree of worsening from moderate to severe almost 50% there too. So yeah, COPD patients in my experience are better controlled with combination of all three ICS/LABA, or LAMA/LABA with an ICS or ICS/LABA with LAMA. So totally, I agree with the presentation and I see that in clinical practice, I used to do... I just stopped doing inpatient practice two years ago, but I used to do both inpatient outpatient, and I see all this hospitalizations of patients with most sometimes back to back admissions for therapeutic exacerbations because of uncontrolled exacerbations. And a lot of times they end up on oxygen and get sent home on oxygen or even sometimes get switched to bipap or even intubated."
"Oh, yes. Triple therapy. Like I said, most of my patients are on triple therapy already for COPD, whether they're separate ICS/LABA with LAMA or LAMA/LABA with an ICS or on one inhaler with triple regimen. Because like I said, based from a clinical experience with my several years of practice that patients need all three for better control, for the COPD and decreasing their progression from moderate to severe or severe to very severe, decreasing there need to be on supplemental homo two, especially."
"When do I considered triple therapy? Yeah. Earlier after mild COPD, where most likely if they're only mild, they probably just need a LAMA or ICS/LAMA, I mean, LAMA/LABA but-"
"Yes. Yes, definitely. You don't use triple therapy when patients already severe with their COPD as much as possible, use them on the moderate degree, moderate COPD down the line. Some practitioners start  inaudible 00:17:15  the triple therapy, if they're already severe or very severe, but you have to start them earlier on because that evolve-"
"Oh, no, no, no. I've been doing it already. It's validating what I've been doing, almost all my patients are on triple therapy already. Like I said, whether it's two separate inhalers or one inhaler they're already on triple therapy because probably I only have mild COPD patients. I would tell you probably only 5%, most of them are already more to severe or severe, or very severe. So it validates what I've been doing for many, many years. Yeah."
Okay. So you're referring to closed triple therapy. We're all three are in one inhaler. Yeah. The advantage of that is it promotes better patient compliance. They don't have to use two separate inhalers. In one inhaler they get three.
"Yeah, they get three, the ICS/LAMA and the LAMA/LABA and all of that, so it promotes better patient compliance."
"Okay. The data here is more succinctly presented with regards to the degree of the mortality reduction, 50% mortality reduction, the degree of... Or the frequency of exacerbations almost 25% from progression from moderate to severe, almost 50%. So the data that presented right now with trilogy is more robust and more powerful and higher degree as compared to what I know with trilogy. Yeah. So if you're asking me about the difference between the two, with the presentation that I got right now, I'll just tell you that the degree of reduction in all three parameters are higher with Breztri."
"Yeah, so right. It increases my confidence with using Breztri earlier on knowing what the..."
"Okay. Definitely seven for all three increases, urgency to treat motivates me to prescribe Breztri differentiates Breztri from other close triple therapies available. Yeah. The only one available right now is trilogy. So definitely seven for all three."
Yeah. That's what I've been doing right now. I'm not paying attention to these   00:22:48 .
"Yeah. So it presents the 52% reduction versus LAMA/LABA with reducing the rate of exacerbation and there's additional 18% reduction versus ICS/LABA. So it's presenting here using Breztri the reduction from more to severe using either LAMA/LABA or an ICS/LAMA. So great person this reduction with versus LAMA/LABA, of course. So yeah, it's all good. It's all definite benefits and significant benefits of that."
"Okay. So getting from here, they're presented more in a way it's not just a bar graph like I said, 52% fewer exacerbations as compared to LAMA/LABA from moderate or severe exacerbations. And then the one great thing too is, it's more relatable with, again, a picture of patients in here. So you prevent one moderate exacerbation for every three patients treated with Breztri versus LAMA/LABA alone. So LAMA/LABA alone which are from Anor to Bevespi still do. So preventing one out of every three patients, so powerful protection."
"Okay. I was wondering if you're muted again. Yeah. It's the same thing. It's just presented a different way. So only Breztri prevents exacerbations versus LAMA/LABA, the 52% reduction in rate of severe observations. It's a different way of presenting it. It's just emphasizing more in this slide compared to the slides presented earlier, but the same 52% reduction in the rate of moderate, specific exacerbation versus LAMA/LABA alone, no ICS with it just LAMA/LABA alone. So it's not combination with ICS, not a close triple therapy. So just LAMA/LABA."
"Okay. Yeah. So this defines it more compared to the other close triple therapy. The fact that it's emphasizing only Breztri. So yeah, with the data presented again, compared only to LAMA/LABA and not LAMA/LABA with ICS. So it's differentiating it from the other closed triple therapy."
What original are we talking about? This one. Okay.
"Okay. As opposed to this, well, it just presents you more data again, with the additional information about your preventing one out of three patients that you put on Breztri."
"Yes, because again here, it's emphasizing more that only Breztri, that it prevents exacerbations versus LAMA/LABA. So it differentiates it from the other triple close loop or close triple therapy."
"I would say because of the additional data with the prevention of one out of three, I would go with the  inaudible 00:29:24  EC actually for all three."
"Oh, second place. Okay. I would go with AODEA, because again, it deals steals you right away, only Breztri, 52% reduction against LAMA/LABA, and 18% reduction against ICS/LABA."
Same thing with differentiates from other close triple therapies available.
"Okay. So how significantly uses hospitalization versus ICS/LABA. So 20% reduction with ICS/LABA, as opposed to 16% reduction with LAMA/LABA. Yeah. There's no significant difference between the 20%, 16%, but it's just identifying which ones you're differentiating it with. ICS/LABA versus LAMA/LABA. So just about 4% difference, but overall there's a significant reductions for both."
"Okay. Same thing, just presented a different way."
"Right. So on the hospitalizations for versus ICS/LABA in LAMA/LABA, there's hired difference there as opposed to the first slide percentage. So 23% reduction hospitalizations versus ICS/LABA, and 20% reduction for LAMA/LABA that's on hospitalization. So overall the slide on the left side is just with ICS/LABA, but with regards to LAMA/LABA, there's 16%, but it's like just an additional information at the bottom of it. So it's an added presentation."
It's more detailed compared to the first slide.
"Yes, yes, yes, definitely. It's studied in different continents from Europe to North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. Yeah. So it's universal. The benefits are being seen universally, not just in the U.S or North America."
"Yeah. It's relevant, the data, the benefits of Breztri, you can extrapolate it in other countries, not just where we're at U.S or even North America, that definitely the benefits with reducing COPD hospitalizations are being seen the reduction. The significant benefit are being seen not only in the U.S, but other countries as well."
"Okay. So it's the same presentation in the upper part, there's just an added data on protecting one COPD hospitalization for every 31 patients treated with Breztri versus ICS/LABA, Breztri power protection against COPD hospitalizations. Not this. So, yes, it's again, the added information about protecting one hospitalization for every 31 patients. That's a good information to add as opposed to patients only on ICS/LABA."
"Okay. So, 64% LAMA/LABA is a different trial. Looks like in KRONOS. The other one is  inaudible 00:34:54  but it's essentially significant reduction, especially with LAMA/LABA in the KRONOS trial."
Which one is an improvement of the original.
"Yeah, because this one now ALDHB you're presenting the data, you're presenting the results of the trial, the KRONOS and the  inaudible 00:35:43  trials. So it's not just claiming it. Now you have a study to prove it. So I would say the ALDHB is an improvement compared to the original ALDHA."
"Yes. It's an improvement. It's an improvement too. But if you compare it with ALTHB, ALTHB is more detailed presentation regarding reduction of  inaudible 00:36:18  hospitals based from trials done."
Right. ALDHC again is a presentation of ALDHA and an additional information in a bar graph with regards reduction of COPD hospitalizations.
"Yes, because it's giving you more information as opposed to just one presentation on the 20% reduction."
"Okay. So to increase the treat, I would go with AlDHC as my first motivation or increasing urgency to treat motivates me to prescribe Breztri, differentiates it from other close triple therapy."
The second would be the presentation with the data with the KRONOS and the ethics. So I would choose ALDHB as my second motivation and the same thing with increasing urgency and differentiation.
"Oka. So ranking again, I would go with the presentation that only Breztri that emphasis that only Breztri decreases 20%. So I would go with that and the last one would be the original."
"Okay. So 50% reduction of death cost versus LAMA/LABA, and then almost 30% reduction with ICS/LABA for every 80% that are treat with Breztri instead of LAMA/LAVA, one death can be prevented. Yes. I actually think it's higher than that, more than probably I would say 30 patients, not 30, not 80 instead of LAMA/LABA one death can be prevented. And the number of studies number of subjects are very significant. 2,137 versus LAMA?LABA, 2,120."
"Yes, definitely. Yes. Every life saved matters to their loved ones, definitely without saying, so again, the same presentation, 50% reduction rate of death versus LAMA/LABA around 30% reduction versus ICS/LABA. Again, the emphasis on what additional life safe for every 80 degrees is treated with Breztri instead of pure LAMA/LABA."
"I would say it's almost the same, actually. I don't see much of a difference. You have the 50% reduction versus LAMA/LABA and the almost 30% reduction versus ICS/LABA. And then you have the presentation about one additional life save for every 80 patient."
"Right. I don't know if I would... It just makes it more dramatic or more, I don't know, not really hysteric, but of course every life saved matters their loved ones. It goes without saying."
"If it's just for the practitioner, for me, doesn't make much of a difference from the first one to the second one."
"It just specifies as only Breztri, but again, the same information about the 50% reduction versus LAMA/LABA and again, one death prevented for every 80 patients instead of LAMA/LABA. So the only difference here, as opposed to the other presentations is emphasizing right there on top of the slide, only Breztri."
"I would go with the first one, not so much with the survival, but yeah, the decrease all cost mortality."
"Yeah. This is more relatable. It's easier for me as a practitioner to look at it this way, rather than the other presentation, the other slide."
Yeah. It's a personal preference. I'm used to looking and interpreting graph that this way rather than the other way.
"Yes. Yes. All the data that I've seen for other medicine, for example, time to all cost mortality is more what their dealt that they've been studied for. Not so much with the second presentation."
"Right. This is basically going through oldest studies that are available now. So yeah, comparison of mortality, cross single inhaler, tumor therapy and cardioprotective treatment studies. So the three first presented are very significant difference compared to LAMA/LABA and ICS LAMA/LABA, and ICS LAMA/LABA triple therapy. So Breztri significant number needed to treat 80."
"Very relevant because especially with patients on a LABA alone without blocking or without counteracting, the possible cardioprotective risk for using LABA. So using Breztri on a triple close to therapy where you have ICS on it kind of like blocks the LABA effect on the  inaudible 00:45:38 , because it's the LABA here that's causing a lot of complications with sinus tachycardia and hypertensive urgencies and all that. And although a lot of patients like it was presented earlier on are not so much dying from hypoxemia, but from major adverse cardiovascular events like MI."
"Okay. Yeah. Like I said, a while ago I don't proceed an improvement of the original to state about every life save matters, their loved ones. Of course, we know that."
Right. This presentation alone drives the benefits.
"Oh, yes. Yes. If you compare it with, from the original."
"Okay. So the ranking, so I would go with just, like I said, I like the presentation on the graph. The original would still be very good for me. Compare, you see the difference between the other on the graph, what it's compared with. So I would go with my original M as my first motivation in increasing the urgency to treat and differentiating definitely from other close triple therapies available."
"So the presentation on only Breztri, that would be my second option. And the last one would be regarding the information on every life save."
"Thank you. Okay. So this was the one that was presented by the voiced, the lady that recorded information in the beginning. Yeah. So all of this are true. Just one exacerbation increase on COPD hospitalizations by 21%. One in five patients die within one-year of their first hospitalizations. First hospitalization, not seeing this much emphasized, but to know this is definitely a wake up call and yes, exacerbates increased the risk of MI by more than 2%, more than twice. That's a powerful information also."
"This is more detailed, risk their breathing. What does that mean? Risk their breathing, risk their heart. Okay. So it's more layman's term here now risk their breathing twice. The rate of lung function decline with even one exacerbation risk their heart twice the risk of Y following exacerbation risk, their mental health. Okay. Risk their future."
"Okay. So yes. Okay. So it's going from one based to another, from their breathing to the heart, to mental health, to their future, this gives more detailed information. Although the headline on the risk their breathing, it's more like layman term to me, but when it goes to the lung function and the risk of MI and anxiety and depression, hospitalization, it gives more detailed information to the provider. I wish that the headline is not so much with a risk their breathing, risk their heart, risk their mental health. This is good more for the laymen, for the patient, if this is being presented to the patient."
"Right, right. It's relatable. It brings forth the information and the benefits."
"Yes. Very powerful presentation symptoms are warning sign. Definitely. Yeah. COPD is a third leading cause of death. And it's actually the only one of two that's not decreasing. It's still up in there, year after year. COPD still it's not going down a cost of death."
"Very good. Yes, totally agree with everything, protect patients from the start. That's very good information there. It drives down the benefits why you need to start triple therapy, from the get go further on, rather than waiting until patients are severe. Very severe."
"Okay. Improvement on the original. I would say actually the UD it's a presentation that just by looking at it right away, it grabs your attention without going through each and every data. So all of them are improvement on their original. If we start it this way first. Yeah."
Okay. Number one would be ALDUD for everything. Yeah. The second would be symptoms are warning signs.
"And then, it only takes one exacerbation. Original would be next for me."
"Okay. So you do have again, the result of the KRONIS trial, did you know that one in two exacerbations go unreported? That's true. A lot of patients don't come to the office, don't present to urgent care or ed and unreported, I would say actually higher than wanting to exacerbations, re exacerbate, regardless of what your patients report. Okay. Yes. We saw that the data on that graph, no, you do have now here, the overall population prior exacerbations, regardless Breztri gives the benefit better than LAMA/LABA."
"Right. Right. So like it says, a lot of patients don't report exacerbation or don't come in during exacerbation. So whether they self-medicate or unless they feel like they're dying or they can breath away just when they come in. So they do have either mild or moderate or severe exacerbation, regardless of the degree exacerbation, regardless of exacerbation history, Breztri definitely provides benefits."
"Totally agree. Yes. 34  inaudible 00:57:00  didn't have exacerbation in the last year, but it still, without a recent exacerbation, only Breztri significant reduced exacerbations, a presented with the graph on the right side of the slide."
Which one do I prefer? I actually prefer the right side. Only Breztri significantly reduced even i-
"Oh, okay. I like this better the second time."
"Because it's more relatable, especially with the mention about, without even a recent exacerbation, because although it's Breztri exacerbations, it drives the point that even with patients, without recent history of exacerbation, they're definitely a great benefit with using Breztri."
"Right. Right. So, yeah. I mean, even without recent exacerbation because we know for a fact, like it was presented on the other graph a while ago that some patients don't report exacerbation. So you don't have to wait for an exacerbation or many exacerbations to prescribe a Breztri."
"Oh, okay, that's what you're referring to. Yes, yes, definitely. So for patients that don't have, or not presenting with frequent exacerbations, yes. This is a different patient population. That's what you're asking. Yes."
"Well, it just drives the point that you have to use closed triple therapy earlier on, because of all the benefits that were presented in all the slides. So you have to start Breztri earlier on close therapy or because of all the benefits from frequency of exacerbations, to rate of hospitalizations from going from moderate to severe and all cost mortality, whether they have had main exacerbations or without recent exacerbation yet."
"It drives the benefits more. I mean, like I said, it emphasizes the benefits of using Breztri compared to LAMA/LABA, compared to ICS/LABA compared to even the other closed triple therapy or separate two inhalers containing... Yeah. Especially with the last slide that I like, like I said, it gets my attention right away about the what's this? From decreased hospitalizations, the last one, the one with all the errors there decreases hospitalizations decrease MI decreases... Not this one, the last one with regards to there. One moderate exacerbation accelerates."
"Accelerate disease progression. Yeah. Protect patients from the start, that information, especially the one in the bottom that drives the point a lot more compared to all the other presentations actually."
"Okay, great. Thank you so much. Well, back to work. Thank you. Bye-bye."
"I'm a family practice physician. I'm solo practice. I actually have worked in a number of different venues, but currently I own my own practice and I do home care. I basically do house calls to private homes, assisted living facilities, nursing homes. So my population is mainly geriatric, 100% Medicare."
"Well, like I said, I have an elderly, very sick population, basically home bound people. So I see quite a bit of chronic disease, COPD, coronary artery disease, strokes, Alzheimer's disease, but COPD is something that I see quite a bit of. So my approach is I'm dealing with a geriatric population with a wide degree of education or experiences background wise. So in general, I'm kind of the leading them down the pathway of how to treat COPD when they have it."
"Well, certainly it depends on if it... are you talking about a new onset patient that I'm seeing with COPD?"
"Okay. So, yeah, with a new patient that I'm suspicious of COPD, certainly I'd start out with getting a history, doing a physical examination, then possibly some diagnostics of chest x-ray, possibly a pulmonary function test, possibly a referral to a pulmonologist. And in general, I would probably initiate treatment if I'm highly suspicious, probably at that appointment, depending on how symptomatic the person was. And in general, I probably would start with Spiriva the. A lot of what I start with has to do with coverage issues and not having to deal with prior authorization. So in general, I would start with Spiriva, and sometimes Advair, long acting beta agonist on top of that and a rescue inhaler, potentially. Depending on how symptomatic, sometimes I just start with a rescue inhaler while I'm getting diagnostics."
"Well, generally that is somewhere down the line. So adding a steroid on to an anticholinergic is probably something I would do very quickly, and then maybe withdraw the long acting beta agonist, but it would be somewhere down the line. A lot of times I'll have a referral to a pulmonologist for a pulmonary function test, and then they will give me some recommendations based on the pulmonary function test, or they'll give a patient a sample of something like Trelegy or Incruse Ellipta and then I'll take it from there. And oftentimes, there are insurance barriers limiting what is affordable for the patient."
"I suppose... in my venue I don't get to talk to a lot of reps, but when I do, it deals with efficacy, safety and the longevity of therapy or getting people on, whether it be dual therapy or triple therapy early on."
"Well, I think using a glucocorticoid for example has a more of a long term preventative aspect to reduce exacerbations and certainly first line therapy, anticholinergics to reduce symptomatic and certainly a beta agonist to open up the airway to get more respiratory flow."
"Well, the biggest question is coverage. I have to deal with this a lot, is someone gets a triple dose combination therapy and insurance won't cover it. I have to try to prior authorize it or try to switch it to something similar, and it becomes a process and oftentimes I have to give them the second best suggestion that I have or the third best as opposed to what the person has been successful with. So that's the biggest issue."
"I mean, as long as there are, I guess compliance would be one thing, making sure that people are taking the dose as a maintenance therapy and you often have to have that conversation. It's not an as needed medication, it's a medication. It has to be used daily. So that is one barrier that I see."
My screen just shuts down after I don't look at it for a while.
Okay. I think it's trying to log on here.
"Well, I have the welcome screen on here, but it's not..."
"Well, I think the main point is to add a little bit of emergency to the impact that COPD is having. I think the intention of the screen gives some very fundamental, very understandable ideas that physicians will know, but it won't be on top of their minds, and I think it just does that well and bringing attention to the severity and the impact that COPD has."
"I there's really nothing that's not resonating. I like that... I would say that it's a very fundamental look for physicians to look at this without any obscure data or complicated data. So I think if its purpose is an introduction to say, take a look at this and think about this, I think it does a great job at that. The up to 40% of patients are readmitted within 90 days is something that is very interesting, caught my eye, probably as much as any of the other bullet points."
"I guess. I wouldn't say necessarily a surprise, but when you put it in writing and I kind of reflect on my patient population, it makes sense, but it kind of makes you reflect and look at your patient population and how many admissions that you're getting on a  inaudible 00:17:04  basis."
I guess the third leading cause of death. I don't know if I was aware it was that high on the list.
"It's not necessarily the information, but it's making me work a little bit hard to... the writing is somewhat small."
"It's somewhat of a random group of facts that I have to string together somehow, as opposed to just coming out and making it simple. And not that it's not understandable, it's just it's taken me a little more time to figure out what they're trying to convey here."
"Well, I guess it's looking at the number of deaths or the mortality rates in the United States of America compared to the rest of the world or the rest of the world compared to the United States of America, and apparently it's much higher in the United States. "
"And then the second slide is the low socioeconomic status, just showing environmental toxins, I guess."
I'm surprised at how confusing this slide is?
"Well, I mean, I guess the magnifying glass here with significant levels compared with England, I get it, but I don't know why that has to be a... it's an unexciting bullet point when you've already got the COPD deaths in 2017."
That's a little more clear. Yeah. Because you're looking at the map.
"That's interesting. I mean, it's understandable. I think that it's logical that the higher numbers in the higher areas, there's going to be a difference in mortality rates."
"I think it's not. I think it's... to be honest, it's confusing me why that's in there. I mean, it seems like there's two different separate points being made by this slide. And I understand there's some link to deaths and the environmental issues and other comorbidities, but at the same time, I don't know why those two points are... it seems like it's making me work too hard to stay interested in the slide."
"I don't think it does improve the slide. I don't know why England would... I mean, I don't know enough about England's habits to actually see where that is, how to process that information. I don't know their smoking rates, how their hospitals work. "
So I don't know... it doesn't really ground me onto why that specifically would be a comparison tool.
"Well, I guess maybe what would be more relevant is maybe have several places and their rates. England, France, Egypt, industrialized countries maybe. So that will be more of a comparison with several different rates listed."
"That... well, I guess the main takeaway is a lot of people are having exacerbations of their COPD, reported or unreported."
The 50% to 78% of COPD exacerbations are not even reported. That stuck out to me compared to everything else on the slide.
"Yeah. It's surprising. Not so much surprising, it's just interesting data. It makes sense. Not something that was on the top of my thought process, but when you put it out in front on a piece of paper, that does make sense."
No. I think this is a pretty straightforward slide. I don't have any problem with anything here.
"Well, I guess I'm going to digress for a second here. There is something that I guess I'm a little bit confused at. This spiromics, the uplift and the eclipse."
I got you. All right. So that makes more sense then.
"Well, I think it does a pretty good job of catching your attentions with up to 77% of patients with COPD have at least one moderate or severe exacerbation. So you're trying to relay the gravity of a condition that may go unrecognized, and I think it does that well. It's relatively simple. Doesn't require a whole lot of work to understand the slide. You have to understand, we look at a lot of different material, and I know that the job of the marketing is to try to grab our attention, but when something's over complicated or takes longer to digest, there's another piece of paper somewhere we'd rather look at."
"Yeah. I think that's a nice addition as opposed to the previous slide. I think, I don't know, kind of a little tornado in the background, I don't know if that was intentional to make COPD look like a tornado happening in somebody's life, but that makes sense and it's very simple to understand. And if you've been treating COPD and you've been a physician as long as I have, all of those make perfect sense."
So the main idea is that lung function declines after an exacerbation of COPD.
"Well, the slide's a little busy, but it is understandable. I guess the lack of recovery to pre-exacerbation levels is an interesting fact that is somewhat motivating to maybe be more aggressive in your COPD treatment."
"And then the reduction in lung function, seems they'll be greatest even after a mild COPD exacerbation and the decline B1, that those are interesting aspects."
"Again, just kind of interesting. Just interesting data to process."
"Yeah. Well, it's a little busy. I didn't really read the whole bottom of fine print area. That's a kind of... it's kind of distracting if you're trying to make a point."
"Yeah,   00:35:42  if they're not on a survey study, don't necessarily want to want to read that. But-"
"There's always more detail and more data, and I have no problem reading that, but like I said, there's other things that are out there to read. And I'm just looking at it even from a marketing standpoint. When I first look at this slide, I lose just a little bit of interest seeing that at the bottom before I even read it."
It distracts me from the main point that the slide's trying to make.
"It's almost like do I have to actually read this extra stuff in order to understand the point that's being made or... you know? That means... and like I said, certainly I'm not saying it's bad data. I'm just giving you my initial reaction."
"Well, I think the first graph showing the reduction in lung functioning after an exacerbation and not recovering to the pre-exacerbation level is a very important point because what I'm thinking, and why this is motivating, is that am I doing enough to prevent exacerbation? Am I educating my patients enough? Am I being aggressive enough in my approach? Am I getting backup referrals or am I doing everything I need to do? Because that makes me think that preventing these from happening is probably somewhat of a life-saving process."
That the mortality rate goes up significantly with an exacerbation of COPD. So preventing those exacerbations-
"No, go ahead. I was just saying preventing the exacerbations is very important for longevity."
Yeah. The risk of death is increased by 80% with two moderate exacerbations. That's surprising. That's a high percentage.
"Well, the one to two exacerbations with the 50% of patients dead within five years. The greater than three is kind of understandable that you would have a high death rate if you're having... but the one to two 50% death rate in five years, that's concerning."
"Yeah, I think it's pretty clear. The graph is pretty simple to understand. The percentage points stick out like a sore thumb. It's a pretty simple slide and it grabs your attention."
"I'm kind of on the fence as far as if it's necessary. It's not really telling me much different than what the numbers are showing, but some people like graphs and graphs sometimes grab their attention. I mean, I kind of like graphs, but that graph may attract the attention of some people who don't want to just read or look at words."
"That not only does an exacerbation reduce your lung function, but it affects your vascular system and increases your risks in other areas."
"Well, the 40% increased risk of stroke really sticks out to me. That's a high  inaudible 00:44:10    00:44:10 -"
"Yeah. Yeah. Very surprising. And certainly, the cardiovascular event risk is less surprising, but it's higher than I would've anticipated."
"It's a combination. The stroke is the most surprising, but the actually 90% increases for up to a year  inaudible 00:45:13  event, yeah, those are impressive numbers that the prevention becomes secure."
"So similar to the other slide, that the increased comorbidities outside of lung function associated with COPD and risk of death."
If I would've seen this... this is a little busier slide. 
"I like the presentation of the first one better. The comparison percentages, 40% to 140%, 56%, 54% to 70%, that's not as clear as I would like it to be. I'm not sure if you're saying that it goes up 40% to 140% or there's 140% chance of ischemic disease associated with COPD. It's not clear and it's making me have to think about what are you trying to say as opposed to just reading the data and understanding."
"Well, I guess the first statement is clear, the individual COPD have a two-time greater risk of having cardiovascular disease than those without COPD. That basically sets up the slide well, but to me, it bogs down after that."
"Reasonable information, but it just doesn't grab me. It seems like I already know that. That's not... you know? It's not something that I need to be told."
"Well, it's still another look at the increased risk of cardiovascular disease or the impact of COPD and cardiovascular disease together."
"It's resonating, but it's not resonating loudly."
"It seems much more passive in trying to be an impact, have an impact. Across five studies up to 39% of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular causes, and that's not overwhelming to me for some reason. And I know that's a significant number and significant data. And then the graphs... yeah, the graphs take a little bit of work to be clear, and it's workable. Don't get me wrong, but you're trying to figure out cardiovascular deaths compared to COPD deaths and a little bit to figure it out. It's not a bad slide, it's just it doesn't grab me."
"If you have severe COPD, you're probably going to die of respiratory."
"Yeah. And if you have moderate, you have more of a chance of living through the respiratory issues and more of a chance of dying of cardiovascular diseases, which are the number one causes of death."
"Well, the takeaway is that there are environmental factors that can trigger the whole process of COPD with cardiovascular risks leading to death."
"It's not resonating a lot here. I kind of see what they're doing here, but they're doing it in a roundabout way, which could be simplified."
"Well,   00:54:51  the circular, the pictures of a cigarette, and then I had to kind of look at the other picture closely, a factory and a car and then with arrows going down to COPD and what the lungs do, and then going over to cardiovascular, what happens in cardiovascular disease. That's all fine and dandy, but I don't know that it's necessary. I don't know if it gives me any more data other than looking at a circular decision tree. Doesn't really give me any information that isn't already implied."
"Well, it's very simple. It may be too simple. I mean, it certainly gives you very easy information to digest, but it doesn't give you much information that you don't know already."
"So if you have an exacerbation, you have more exacerbation."
"Slightly resonates that the time between subsequent exacerbations shortens after an exacerbation. It's not surprising, but actually seeing that data makes you think about... makes you reflect on that."
"Yeah. I mean, I don't really know about the first graph of percentage of people with none, one and greater than two exacerbations. I mean, that's nice data to know, but it doesn't tell me much other than that people have exacerbations. So-"
No. The second graph is a little bit better.
Pretty basic information. Nothing that's that gripping. Pretty relatively common knowledge of dyspnea and its association with COPD and their exacerbations.
It's interesting. I guess I don't focus on eosinophils as much in COPD as I do in asthma. 
"And so this is interesting information as to why we probably... well, I mean, I use inhaled corticosteroids anyway, but that's even more reason to do that because I see my patients monthly. And so I'm relatively routine in getting blood work, depending on if they're diabetic, every three months, at minimum every six months on the patient population I'm dealing with, but sometimes even monthly. And I do see elevated eosinophil levels sometimes on their CBC, so that slide is interesting to me."
"So I guess the overall point is aggressive therapy early to reduce early exacerbation in patients, which is... and that's an interesting thought. Would make me rethink some of my approach to a certain level. I guess I would want to look into the data to see if that's correct. I mean, what you have to also include is have patients with multiple comorbidities on multiple medications and interactions with medications is sometimes an issue when starting triple therapy, for example, immediately."
Patient sensitivity. But this data is relatively convincing that the risk of letting that first exacerbation occur is maybe bigger than whatever else I'm thinking about why I'm not starting. It does make me kind of rethink things with the data that-
"Well, it kind of gives a basic summary of management of COPD. There's nothing in here that's surprising or different. Just kind of reading it kind of confirms that this is basically what I do when I see somebody with COPD. It's more of a confirming slide."
"Okay. So my overall takeaway is actually, when you put your education together and you learn some things that you should be thinking, my overall takeaway is that exacerbations of COPD cause a reduction in increased morbidity and increased mortality, and that delaying treatment may not be the optimal approach in these patients to reduce those numbers."
"Seems like Product X, when compared to dual therapies, is more efficacious at reducing exacerbations as well as eosinophilia."
I'd say a five on that seven  inaudible 01:13:02 .
"I don't know if I'm getting a clear patient that I would use, but other than those who are previously on LABA LAMA or ICS LABA, which I have a number of people on, but I've had a number of people on triple therapy and they really liked it. They... so, yeah, I mean, this is definitely compelling enough data that I would probably start people on triple therapy when it's available, if available is sooner."
"Well, it certainly would fit in with my patient population. I have many of my people with COPD have a combination of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease even or prior strokes. So they have multiple comorbidities, so their risk is probably even higher than some of the general data that I'm seeing here, because they already have known disease, cardiovascular disease. So it probably would tend to make me want to be more aggressive if the data is correct as it's written and I believe it, then it would make me want to be more aggressive and try to get these people more aggressive therapy early."
"I would keep D, yeah. I would keep F and G."
Where is that? Okay. It's up in the corner.
"That COPD exacerbations have a major impact on morbidity and mortality, and actually more so than I thought, and aggressive triple therapy early has been shown to reduce all cause mortality in patients. And there's a significant amount of cardiovascular disease, as well as cerebral vascular disease that could be relatively reduced if we could start people earlier on triple therapy."
Not a problem. I won't take it personally.
"Yeah, sure. So, I'm a family doc. I went back and did complete a fellowship in geriatrics. I used to do the full scope of family medicine, the cradle to the grave type care. Now I am focused just on care of the elderly. My niche is caring for those folks who reside in assisted living and memory care. So, it's the Medicare 65 and older set."
Let's say... I'm going to hazard a guess. Let's say a hundred.
"Yeah. Well, my practice, like I said earlier, is folks from Medicare set. So, these are all 65 and older. That's probably the best I can tell you that. In terms of the severity, I would say it's probably a 25/50/25 split; so mild, moderate, severe."
"I would say the 25%, 25 out of the hundred, the severe folks, are the ones I have on triple therapy."
"So I'm trying, not always successfully, but I do try to follow, I believe it's called GOLD, G-O-L-D, Global Obstructive Lung Disease, something or other like that, the guidelines. And so, I think they've made a big push. They like to see the use of short acting antimuscarinics, or maybe even long-acting antimuscarinics, sooner, rather than say the previous combined inhaled corticosteroid long-acting beta agonist. So, we'll try the LAMA first and then we'll add on a component. And it also depends on which the insurance will allow for, which medication the insurance will allow for. Anyways, if they're not responding to the LAMA, then we'll add either a LABA or we'll do the... Throw in a triple or something like that."
"Yeah. So, usually try to do the LAMA first. So the long acting antimuscarinic antagonist, or whatever it is. They call it LAMA these days."
"And then we'll move on to triple, just because typically the inhaled corticosteroid is already combined with a long-acting beta agonist."
"I mean, there are a couple that are separate but usually-"
"Oh. Well, so I mean, the patient just isn't responding to the way that you would want, that they would want. In other words, they're still short of breath, they don't have the energy to do what they want to do, they're still bothered by their symptoms."
"Yeah, sure, absolutely. So, I mean, one of the first things I do is just to figure out... For us in primary care, what we're trying to do is figure out, is this lung-related or is this heart-related? And especially given the age of the folks I take care of, there's a high preponderance of heart disease complicating this. Of course, this is also the generation that smoked, or that was still smoking up until recently. And so, that's where the COPD, the lung aspect comes in. And then, of course, then there's the atypical presentation for pneumonia. So not everybody who has pneumonia actually coughs per se, not everybody has a fever, per se. So, that's something else that we look into. One of the things I'll do is order a chest x-ray, after the physical exam, assuming that they don't have any edema to complicate things, assuming that there aren't any rails to complicate things, assuming there's no fever, no hypotension, to make you think in terms of sepsis. Then we might move on directly."
"The other part too is just to check and see, are you hypoxic? If we've never dealt with this before, and you had your first exacerbation, I might be thinking, ""Okay, maybe this is just a mild slash moderate situation."" But if somebody's hypoxic as a result, like, ""Whoa, how do we go from normal to moderate/severe,"" because dependency for supplemental oxygen, kind of ramp things up a little bit, at least in my mind."
"So, the one send out that I will typically do if I can, is a pulmonary function test, because that's really defining characteristics in terms of COPD. The other thing too, would be blood work. And typically I can arrange the blood work at their place of residence, because if they're so ill that they need somebody like me to come to them, then it doesn't make sense to see them in their place of residence and then say, ""Okay, now you got to leave to get blood work done."" We have to be able to do everything in a portable sense at their place of residence. So I'll typically, do a simple CBC and then order BNP and NT-proBNP, just as a means to rule out heart failure from a blood work perspective. The chest x-ray, obviously will give us-"
"No, I was just going to say, I mean, the chest x-ray will help us, if we see fighting consistent with pulmonary edema versus an infiltrate versus just hyperinflated lungs and nothing else going on, which would make us think more in terms of COPD."
"So, if we're looking at somebody with heart failure, then diuresis is appropriate, review their meds and just make sure that we have them on guideline directed medical therapy, aspirin, or some kind of antiplatelet, optimize their blood pressure management. I think I said, diuresis earlier. Manage atrial fibrillation, if that's the cause of their exacerbation, rate control, maybe a statin, if we're thinking in terms of coronary artery disease, those types of things."
"So again, we try to get some sense in terms of where they're coming from. In other words, is this the first time? Has it happened before? How frequent are you having these episodes? What's the impact on your life, on your function? What did you used to be able to do that you can't do now? That type of a thing. And then talk about what's the appropriate medication management for the patient, in terms of their insurance. And also ask the question, do you need oxygen or not, based on their oxygen saturation."
"Usually I'll have to get them out to a pulmonologist for PFT just to get appropriate testing, because I'm mobile. I don't carry a PFT with me from place to place. And then, if I'm suspecting cardiovascular disease, or I need to get that evaluated, anything beyond an echo, which can be done... Not me, but I can order it to be done bedside. Anything else beyond that, then I'll send out to the pulmonologist."
"I would say the vast... I'm trying to think of who might not. I mean, again, given that the folks that I care for live in assisted living and memory care, the rationale is that they have some medical issues where they can't manage on their own. More likely than they're just not wanting to mow the lawn type thing. So I would have to say 75, minimum, 75% have some kind of comorbidity."
"Well, the heart disease aspect because that always... It's a little tricky sometimes in trying to figure out is this... Not everything that wheezes is necessarily asthma or COPD. So is there any cardiovascular complication? Diabetes is an issue, just because if we have to think in terms of steroid burst or something like that, what's the impact on their glycemic control? Luckily it's not like we're talking about constant use or... Hopefully not, in terms of steroids, because then that would definitely bump them up to the severe category. But there are those folks and we have to walk that fine find balance between use of steroids and their diabetic management."
"Typically, I can manage most of the issues. It's when they need diagnostics that are beyond what I can offer on a mobile basis, that we might send them out, but typically, the vast majority of things we can do right there at the bedside, if you will."
"I mean, when it comes to medication management, short of... There's certain medications where insurance might have a fit, in terms of me prescribing. And so, like, ""All right, here, you guys take care of it. Got to give you something to do."" But short of that, most of the time we can manage on our own with the patient."
"I mean, I point out sometimes the dichotomy in terms of the fact that we use beta blockers for heart disease and we use beta agonists, in terms of both rescue and prevention for respiratory disease. So I kind of point that out to the patient in terms of how you have situations where a pulmonologist might want one thing and a cardiologist might want the other, and the role of primary care myself as a family doc, is to serve as referee and make sure that we manage the patient's goals appropriately."
"No, no, no. I'm just pointing it out, because I think you were asking, if I understood your question, you were asking about issues in terms of comorbidities-"
"So that's why I was just pointing out that sometimes, I do point out to the patient that there are issues where different disease specialists might... Contradict isn't quite the right word, but they have their different approaches that might be antagonistic towards a condition."
"  00:19:55 . Yeah. I mean, I think I have to take into account the whole patient. So, my choices right now are rather limited if I understand correctly in terms of COPD, at least things that we could readily use. We have inhalers, various types of inhalers, if you want to break that down: meter dosed, dry powder inhalers, soft mist inhalers, we have nebulizers. And it's typically one of three options, if I'm not mistaken, maybe four. There's a short-acting beta agonist, that's albuterol, there's a short-acting beta agonist plus short-acting muscarinic antagonist, that would be ipratropium combined with albuterol. And then, we have any number of long-acting muscarinic antagonists. We have a couple of long-acting beta agonists. We have a bunch of inhaled corticosteroid-"
"I think right now it's pretty much similar because even as I point out the beta agonist, beta antagonist duality, if you will, there are some studies that point out that use of beta blockers... Make sure I say this correctly, beta blockers in the setting of COPD does not decrease or worsen mortality. And if anything, actually benefits them. And of course, what we try to do is pick beta blockers that are cardio specific rather than more generalized that might get into the pulmonary system."
"My first thought was, ""Oh, just about everybody."" At least half."
"Just because, I mean, when we think in terms of risk factors, whether it's dietary, whether it's their weight, whether it's tobacco use, their blood pressure, diabetes, sugar control, lack thereof. I'd say those are all risk factors."
"Yeah, I think you could push it up to 75%."
"Because again, as a family doc, we have to take over the whole person, not just a disease process or organ process. And so, on a regular basis, I have to review their medications and make sure that they are working in concert or to figure out if there's a better balance that can be achieved in their  inaudible 00:24:20 ."
"A better or an easier, at least in my mind, an easier example in terms of compromise, it is between chronic kidney disease and heart failure, because I've bumped into this quite a bit lately. Where with heart failure, you're trying to get rid of some excess fluid, so you typically, you use a diuretic to manage that, but the diuretic aggravates their kidney function and makes it worse. And so, then you're kind of stuck between that rock and a hard place. And you're asking them to make a difficult choice. Like, ""Okay, what's more important to you, your heart or your kidneys?"" Right? Because I have to give you a water pill in order to get rid of fluid so you can breathe properly to make it easier on your heart. But when I do so, I make it more difficult for your kidneys and push you closer towards  inaudible 00:25:24 . Luckily, as far as I can tell, that's not as problematic of a choice between heart disease and COPD."
"Again, I talked about the beta blocker, beta agonist, conflict... I should say pseudo conflict, but in reality, most of the time when I've read studies, they do advocate the use of beta blockers in COPD just-"
"I don't think you can prioritize one over the other, aside from the complications. Right? Because you got to be able to breathe, but you also have to be able to prevent the next cardiovascular event."
"I don't see the conflict between the two. Again, aside from that theoretical beta agonist beta-"
"Beta antagonist thing. I mean, so you get a statin, but I'm not aware of any issues between statins and lung disease. You could have an ACE and an R and aside from a dry cough, there's really nothing there either. A beta blocker diuretic would help you clarify one or the other. Right?"
"Probably with the next visit. As soon as a month goes by, because if it's-"
"Well, going from single, right, from just a basic LAMA to throwing on something else. And so, I think the big choice that I have in most cases... See the other thing in terms of, what do I offer them? How do I choose? Besides the insurance choice. How easy is it for them to manipulate the inhaler?"
"And then, we have to ask the question, ""Well, what is the inhaler... What's available via that inhaler company, that pharmaceutical company?"" Because one of the things I don't want to do, or at least I think makes life more complicated is to tell a patient, ""Okay, here's how you use inhaler number one. Here's how you use inhaler number two,"" which is made from a different company and has a different technique."
"So I do think that there's an element of making life as easy as possible for the patient. And I think this plays out more in the elderly population, but to some extent, I think it still applies for the rest of us, because why try to learn two different techniques? Right? When it comes to a pill, it doesn't matter whether it's a tablet or a capsule or a BID versus TID versus whatever. It's just put it in your mouth, take some liquid, swallow the darn thing, and you're done."
"I don't think there's an impact of their cardiovascular disease on treatment therapy, per se."
"But the only thing I can think of is that if they are sensitive to the beta agonist, and by that, I mean, they feel the tachycardia associated with that. And then you can make specific drug choice. Right?"
"Is the question next visit, come back. So what do you think? You feeling any better? And they'll say, ""No, I'm still breath, coughing and puffing, whatever."" And you're like, ""Okay, well, let's give you more medicine."""
"So, what would make me refer them to a cardiologist? Somebody with angina that can't be managed just with medication management, somebody who is looking at intervention, somebody who needs more diagnostics to clarify whether we're looking at purely cardiovascular versus the element of respiratory only."
"Well, they're going to take over the care of the cardiovascular-"
"Haven't. I can't think of a situation, no."
"I mean, if somebody is hypoxic, somebody is working harder to breathe, I think there's increased cardiovascular stress, if you will."
"Somebody in failure, somebody with angina that's minimizing their physical activity, I think is going to have greater troubles from a respiratory perspective, because part of the whole process whether it's cardiovascular, whether it's pulmonary, we always tell people you still need to get physically active. And so, if you have some limitations from a cardiovascular perspective, that's going to impact your ability to add physical activity to your armamentarium for COPD."
"I mean, there's got to be some improvement, on a organ basis, if you will."
"But as far as the patient's concerned, I don't know that they separate necessarily one from the other."
"Go on. No, no. I was just thinking, I mean, they just look at it as, ""Here's a bunch of pills I got to take every morning, here's a bunch that I might take midday, here's a bunch I have to take at nighttime. Here's some breathers I got to take in the morning. Here's some breathers I got to take several times a day."" I don't know there's necessarily a connection between the two, per se-"
"I mean, I think there is something on an organ basis, but it's not something that I think we make a big play on these days."
"My first thought is that the bar graphs don't look similar across the four different studies, so that may be due to who they've enrolled because with LHS and EuroScope, you see a lot more cancer related deaths than you do with say Torch and Uplift. With Torch and Uplift, you see more of the respiratory-related death, but less so in LHS and EuroScope."
"But having said that, I mean, that's me looking at these four and just trying to figure out what the difference is. So, I don't necessarily see a common theme per se, except that, obviously somebody did the stack and said, ""Well, across the four studies, two and five were from cardiovascular..."" Okay. That's an interesting perspective."""
"But it also looks like   00:39:10  size. That's 40%... So hang on, let me just think about this for a minute. Each of the studies, I'm looking at death, cancer cause of death, that's the Y axis across the four studies up to 40%... Up to 39%, that's 40%. Doesn't quite make sense to me because the only one that's above 40 is LHS and it's only about 55 give or take, at best."
"Oh, okay. So we're not averaging the four studies, we're just saying up to."
"Yeah. I kind of misinterpreted it differently. I thought it was a... If you do all four together, then it would be 40, that's why I was trying to see above and below."
"Not necessarily surprising. I mean, we're going to have to pass from something, it's just a matter of what we're paying more attention to."
"I mean, it just tells me, we have to have better management... It does make me wonder how COPD and CD were managed in the different studies and who was studied in each of these."
"It's just paragraph looks  inaudible 00:41:36  from each one. I was like, ""Okay."" I was hoping for something a little bit more similar."
"Oh, that is yours. I figured that was mine, I was like, ""Wait, I can't get rid of it."" Okay."
"That is so weird. I was like, ""Okay, who is doing it? Is it me or you?"" Yeah, no, I can see everything."
"Increased at BCOPD alone versus the CD alone. Hang on. Let me think about this properly. Individuals with COPD have two times greater risk of having CD than those without COPD. Okay. Case mortality versus COPD alone. Excuse me. So, the risk of mortality is 40 to 140% greater if you have human heart disease, plus COPD. If you have heart failure, it's 30 to 90. Or if you are looking at the addition of COPD to heart disease, then it's only 27 to 50. Oh, that is interesting."
"If I understand this correctly, COPD doesn't make as big of an impact on heart disease, as much as heart disease does on COPD."
"Interesting. I hadn't really thought about it from that perspective. Hadn't really seen it that way, so it's eye opening. I would've liked a little tighter range if you will. So 27 to 50 already kind of doubled itself, 40 to 140 tripled itself, so I'm like, ""Okay, could we tighten that range a little bit more and get a better comparison?"" But still, I mean, if I understand this correctly, heart disease has a bigger play on COPD than COPD has on heart disease. But regardless, I would think that you still got to manage both of them."
"I mean, just the... I think the idea is that we need to be aggressive with our folks in terms of our heart disease. Make sure that we're following guideline direct management with our folks. Make sure they have an antiplatelet of some sort, ACE and an R, with beta blocker, diuretic if necessary, that type of thing."
"Right, because with the COPD it's more subjective. Right? It's more subjective. It's how do you feel? If you're breathing fine, then we just keep you... Because we're not, there are no objective markers that we follow or manage. Right? Because with ischemic heart disease and heart failure and so on and so forth, we can monitor their weight and use that as a guideline of do you need more diuretic or not. We can monitor their blood pressure to see if they're appropriate and their heart rate. Right? Do they-"
"That's more of a diagnostic tool, or at least the way it's being used now. It both requires to make the diagnosis  inaudible 00:46:26  PFT do that for... So you don't do that on a regular basis for monitoring, not that I'm aware. But the only thing I would think might have some guidance would be, eosinophilia, but realistically, when it comes to that, you know what? We're going to throw the kitchen sink at you. Here's triple therapy, regardless."
"No, no. So there's a push to limit or to use blood eosinophilia to guide the addition   00:47:14 -"
"But my point is that subjectively speaking, when the patient is short of breath and they're already on some kind of LAMA/LABA combination, and the only thing else that you have to throw at them is inhaled corticosteroid, I'll be damned if I'm going to wait for blood eosinophilia to help guide, because let's say it's not. I'm going to withhold this from you? Because that's the only thing I have left for you."
"I haven't seen this one before. So, in the first five days you have an exacerbation of COPD, your risk of heart attack doubles. And in the next six to 10 days, in less than two weeks, your risk of a stroke or heart attack, excuse me, is increased. I haven't seen this before."
"Definitely surprising, because I hadn't really seen this, to really think about it. What it tells me is that we have to go after preventing those exacerbations. So we really have to come up with a better prophylaxis, if you will."
"Right now, I think we're probably more, I think I'm more reactive, in the sense that, well, if you can do what you want and you're not feeling short of breath and we'll continue with our current regimen. We're not thinking of pressing ahead to adding a second inhaler, third inhaler type of thing."
Whereas this makes me wonder why we wouldn't want to be more aggressive with everybody regardless.
"Right. Because the idea is that in moderate exacerbation you have bad things happen outside of just the lung experience. Right? So, if that's the case, you shouldn't just wait for them to have another episode before we say, ""Okay, here's what we're going to do to help manage it."" I guess what I'm trying to think of is, what can we do to prevent that exacerbation in the first place? We have to be more aggressive convincing them to stop smoking. We have to be more aggressive about telling them to stay out of those environments that put them at risk for the exacerbation; that type of thing. We don't have patients per se, although if somebody hasn't climbed up to triple therapy, it might be worth asking the question, would triple therapy or at least double therapy, do better at preventing the next episode? Then just staying on a PRN rescue or something along those lines."
"Huh. Now that's interesting. The gray, which is inhaled corticosteroid slash long-acting beta agonist does better than the LABA/LAMA, because if I'm not mistaken, I think that's actually opposite of current GOLD guidelines in terms of recommendation, at least."
I want to know what it is. I want it on the market now.
I think you have a game changer here. I think this gives me something else to offer my patients.
"I just think we need to clarify the color of the curves because again, at least the most recent time that I was looking at GOLD, there was still the big push to avoid use of inhaled corticosteroid steroids until you've tried the LAMA/LABA thing. And that suggests that the inhaled corticosteroid steroids don't do as well. Excuse me, that combination ICF/LABA doesn't do quite as well as say the LABA/LAMA. Which is why there's been a change in terms of medication management and that's why looking at this slide, it's rather surprising to see that inhaled corticosteroid LABA combination does much better than LABA/LAMA. But more importantly, you've got a new kid on the block, product X."
"Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry. I was looking at product X as just product A. Like what is it? So, if you're looking at triple therapy, makes a big difference, and that being the case, I say, ""Okay, then we should really get everybody on triple therapy of one sort or another."""
"Okay. All right. Give me a second. Let me just figure this out here. Cardiovascular events confirm  inaudible 00:54:35  nonfatal, product X is triple therapy. Got it. Who is LABA/LAMA? So, it's not quite... This one doesn't look as impressive, then. I'm looking focus on the left side. Percent of patients... Oh, I'm sorry. I can't read, I got to learn how to read slides. I'm not sure the Y axis is set up properly for me to interpret it. I think it would be better, if I understand this correctly, so one means equal, correct? Half means that you're better."
"But if you're looking at true percentage of patients, I was like, ""That's really not much to look at then."" 1% percent, one and a half percent, 2%. I mean, that's really not much to look at, then."
That's why I just need some clarity on that in terms of the Y axis.
"All cause total, so you have much less death with a triple therapy than with the other two."
"Cardiovascular is not changed. I'm sorry, is not changed compared to inhaled corticosteroid and LABA. So the addition of LAMA doesn't make a difference. Respiratory does not appear to be different. Cancer's kind of weird, not expecting that. Okay. So, where is all cause coming from? All cause is coming from cardiovascular compared to LABA/LAMA, but it's the same cardiovascular as inhaled corticosteroid steroid LABA. Interesting. So, if I look at this, then any LABA/LAMA this is going to throw my world upside down, because again, GOLD right now is pushing for LABA/LAMA. Whereas this is saying triple therapy is the way to go. The question is, what does triple therapy offer that... What does the LAMA addition to inhale corticosteroid LABA offer?  inaudible 00:57:57  reduction in all cause mortality, but really, no-"
"Exactly. Because right now GOLD is... I got to go back and read GOLD again.   00:58:42  But there's a big push to use LAMA first... LAMA or LABA first, before you... Even the combination, the inhaled corticosteroid has been pushed to last. Well, next to last, because then you have triple therapy as the last because you want to use minimal medication, but here we're saying that triple therapy is really the way to go, and you have to be careful because you don't see a difference in terms of cardiovascular compared to inhaled corticosteroid. But somehow you do manage to eat out a significant reduction in terms of all cause which in the big picture is really what matter. They don't care what they die from, they just don't want die. So, that's where all cause is really the way to look."
"I'm sorry, say that again? What's your question? The addition of what-"
"Well, I mean, the clarity I need is just to figure out, what we should be offering first line  inaudible 01:00:35  would move to triple therapy currently only because it's severe and you're responding to first line. But again, given what you show me in the interim, which is to say cardiovascular disease appears to have a greater impact on COPD... Or excuse me, what is it? A moderate exacerbation, you have a greater risk of cardiovascular events in the first week or two. We should try to prevent those events. And so, could this be the way to prevent it? A week out? And yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty awesome if you can point this out just as a... Point out the obvious, 50% reduction in mortality versus LAMA/LABA and almost two thirds reduction in cardiovascular death versus LAMA/LABA. Yeah. Why not?"
"I mean, it would certainly replace it. It's like don't use that alone, make sure you add triple therapy instead, or make sure you have the inhaled corticosteroid added to it."
"Oh yeah. No, absolutely. I mean, because I really hadn't thought about it in terms of does it make things... It certainly couldn't make it better, but does it really make it worse? Summatively, additively does it make it worse? And so, yeah, I think it's been fascinating just to see that pointed out. Definitely to see the increased risk of, was it heart attack and stroke, in the early days after moderate exacerbation, because that's making me think, ""Well, then we need to prevent the exacerbation in the first place,"" rather than just kind of  inaudible 01:02:50 ."
"Hi everyone. Thank you so much for waiting. We do have the respondent on the line. Our moderator, her name is Mindy. Mindy, your line is now open, you may begin."
"It has welcome, and then on top it has a whole bunch of icons."
"Board certified family practice in a urban area, small urban area. Majority of my patients are over 65. I have heavy managed care, it's a solo family practice. Have been in practice close to 30 years. I used to do hospital work, but I don't go to the hospital anymore. I don't see anybody under 18. That's about it, I think."
"Well, majority of patients have emphysema, chronic bronchitis. Most of them were smokers. I do have a fair share of people with asthma, bronchiectasis, but those are the nuts and bolt of the COPD patients I see."
That are on triple therapy? I would say 40%.
"Well, most of the people have a rescue inhaler, and for maintenance I use the triple therapy. But for patient compliance, since it's, I use mostly Trelegy, which is one puff a day. When you start with multiple medications, a bronchodilator, anticholinergic, and a steroid. It seems maybe there's too many devices. They get mixed up, they don't use it properly. So for patient compliance, convenience, so the triple therapy makes them get better compliance, and patients like it."
"I'm using less and less inhaled steroids. I use mostly the bronchodilators, and a long-acting anticholinergic. The bronchodilators, I'll add for people who have a reversible component asthma, or people don't get good control with the bronchodilator and the anticholinergics, then I'll add the long-acting steroids. So that's why you go into triple therapy."
Okay. Okay. And so when do you escalate to triple therapy?
"When they're not getting good results with this, the long-acting bronchodilator and the anticholinergics, I'll add the steroid."
Okay. Okay. So tell me a little bit about the steps you take when working up a patient who is short of breath.
"Well, take a history, perform a physical, obtain pulmonary function tests, order a chest x-ray. If it's a non-smoker, I'll do antitrypsin titer to see if they have any trypsin deficiency. If history of asthma, then I'll try to modify their environment, get them to quit smoking if they smoke, get rid of pets, declutter their house. And start the medication if it's appropriate, and if they do well with-"
"And I'm thinking maybe just on the workup side of things, not treatment just yet."
"Yeah. PFT, chest x-ray, history and physical, checking for any trypsin deficiency. That's about all."
"Cardiovascular causes? Well, chest x-ray and I guess echocardiogram to see if they have a cardiomyopathy."
"Well, no, not if it's somebody young. When somebody that's older, if they have previous cardiovascular risk factors, if they had a prior MI or if they had history of CHF, if they... Also check their medications. Sometimes medications will cost shortness breath if they have edema or beta blockers or whatever."
"Starting if they're over 40. I mean, I don't do it when somebody who's younger, but if they're over 40 and they have cardiovascular risk factors, I'll work them up."
"Oh, hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, prior cardiovascular events. I mean, prior MI or TIAs, strokes."
"Certainly hypertension, lipid management, diabetes. Well, the patients have their own... They report the play, so I can't do everything. They just have to take some responsibility themselves, but those are the main, hypertension, lipids, diabetes. Those are the main ones I focus on."
Getting them to stop smoking if they smoke.
"Well, the patients I refer, I mean, if somebody has COPD and they're not respond to treatment as I'd like, then I'll refer them to a pulmonologist. Certainly if they have an abnormal echocardiogram, either valvular heart disease or significant cardiomyopathy, then I'll refer them to a cardiologist."
"Well, I have a heavy managed care, so I refer them to... Let's say for cardiology, I refer to the cardiologist. They will see them, put them on treatment program, modify their medications, hopefully send me a report, and they will either make a followup appointment or tell me when they want to see the patient back and give me guidelines as to the treatment protocol."
"The same thing with the pulmonologist. They will see the patient, review their medications, do their own workup with them, and they will either continue to see the patients or send a report, hopefully, and give me the guidelines on when they want to see the patient back. If the patient is stable and well, then they'll discharge the patient back to me. They will continue to see the patient along with me."
"I guess, complex arrhythmias, people that have unstable angina, people that have severe COPD. I mean, people with severe asthma, especially asthmatics that require frequent ER visits. But if they're otherwise stable and doing well, I usually manage them."
"What am I considering? Well, I always worry whether they're taking their rescue inhalers too frequently causing arrhythmias, perhaps causing to develop atrial fibrillation, although that's controversial. But really it's the pulmonary disease, the cardiovascular disease that's related, but it's two different processes."
"Unless they have cor pulmonale, that's right heart failure, then that can cause... That's related more directly. But as far as angina, coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, complex arrhythmias, that's really separate from pulmonary disease."
"Well, COPD. I mean, I guess you have pulmonary hypertension, which would relate to cardiovascular and pulmonary, but I'm talking about COPD."
"Well, most of them have hypertension, so I would say greater than 80%."
"Well, if they have hypertension, I'm certainly monitoring. But the only thing I'm really concerned about as far as medication for COPD and hypertension is the bronchodilators, the short-acting bronchodilators causing, as I said, arrhythmias, whatever, but really they're two different diseases, so I focus on each one separately."
"On the other hand, if they're on a beta blocker, sometimes that will exacerbate COPD. So I might have to change a beta blocker or discontinue that and put them on a different agent."
"That's a big topic. So as I said, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, lipid management, those are the main ones. If they've had a prior MI or prior bypass surgery, then they're also followed by the cardiologist."
"They have stage three or four heart failure, they're also co-managed by the cardiologist. If they're stage one, I usually... or stage two."
"Not that I can relate. There's people that have severe COPD eventually that develop complications, cardiovascular wise, edema, heart failure, whatever, but not directly."
"Exacerbation, I'm not sure it's directly related to cardiovascular disease. I mean, it's..."
"I haven't really thought about it in those terms. I know people that have joint and they have cardiovascular disease, either heart failure and bad COPD or emphysema, chronic bronchitis, they seem to... But I mean, you can have an exacerbation of COPD without any exacerbation of heart failure, so I'm not sure it's directly related."
"Yeah, because they're a delicate balance. I mean, the heart failure, either develop exacerbation of the heart failure or the exacerbation of their COPD. So I guess it's when they go to the ER or whatever or come into the office, it's difficult. Not difficult, but you have to parse out whether it's the heart failure that's worse or the COPD that's worse."
"Not really. I think I have pretty much focused on the COPD part, as I mentioned before, starting with the dual therapy and sometimes adding the steroids, but that's separate in my mind."
"Well, it depends on what their symptoms are. If they have to have exercise intolerance, that's always difficult to say whether it's due to their COPD or it's due to their cardiovascular disease. That's why they need to have some type of nuclear study to find out if they have coronary artery disease, if their valvular heart disease is causing them to be short breath, or if they have a decrease in their LV function or right ventricular function. So when you say a patient has a dual COPD and cardiovascular disease diagnosis, and they have shortness of breath or they have edema, it's difficult. So you have to really find out whether it's due to the COPD or it's due to the heart disease. So sometimes they have to go to the cardiologist to sort of parse that out."
"Well, if they have chest pain or shortness of breath, complex arrhythmias, prior cardiovascular events, as I said before, heart attack or bypass surgery, a valve, if they had prior... And of course if they have pulmonary hypertension, sometimes they get referred back to the pulmonologist, not the cardiologist. And sometimes it goes back and forth. The cardiologist will refer them to the pulmonologist, the pulmonologist refer to the cardiologist. So it's dual therapy, dual  inaudible 00:20:59 ."
"The connection between the two? Well, symptom wise or... well, they both have... That's hard to answer. I mean, shortness of breath would be a common symptom, as I said, you have to sort of decide whether it's due to the cardiovascular or it's due to COPD."
"Well, I guess if they have longstanding, severe COPD, it would cause heart disease. I mean, it would develop, they would develop either right ventricular failure or they would develop arrhythmias due to their heart disease, I mean, due to their severe COPD, they would get arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, whatever."
"No. The other hand, if they have severe, advanced cardiovascular disease, that would cause them to have COPD symptoms. Or if they have advanced COPD, that would cause them the cardiovascular symptoms, either edema, arrhythmias, whatever. So it's sort of... It goes back and forth."
"Right. They have longstanding COPD, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and they start developing arrhythmias due to their COPD."
"Well, I don't know about improving. It would stabilize it. I mean, I don't know if it's going to reverse it, but it would stabilize it and prevent arrhythmias, worsening heart failure, certainly would help the patient with their quality of life, but I'm not sure it's going to improve their COPD."
"Yeah, I do. I mean, I think if they have poorly controlled COPD, it would lead eventually to cardiovascular dysfunction, and as I said, arrhythmias, heart failure, or whatever."
And then not to mention decreased quality of life.
"Well, we didn't talk about cancer, but you know... Okay."
"Well, I know that cancer is a common long-term effect of smoking. COPD, I didn't know was related to asthma or anything like that. And cardiac and cancer related deaths. Okay. Well, I think that's self-evident. 39% of COPD deaths were due to cardiovascular causes. That's a broad category, so what kind of cardiovascular causes are we talking about? Whether it's due to arrhythmias or it's due to heart failure or coronary artery disease. It has a little asterisk next to it that says causes. I assume there's going to be a list of causes. Is that correct, or whatever?"
"Well, I can... Yeah, that's believable. I mean, that makes sense to me."
"Just the percent. I didn't know it was 39%. I know there were cardiovascular causes or great percent, but I didn't know it was 39%."
"Just to reiterate, that COPD is a risk factor for mortality and morbidity. So I know that. I mean, that's common knowledge."
"Individuals, they have two times greater risk of having cardiovascular than those without COPD. Okay. Well, that's interesting. I didn't know that. Twice the risk. Okay. Well, that makes sense. People, if they have COPD and heart disease, they're going to have increased mortality, so I understand that."
The two times greater risk of having cardiovascular disease than those without COPD.
"Just reiterates that having COPD has to do with more than just a lung disease, has to also do with the adverse effects cardiovascular wise."
"Yeah, I just said people that have advanced COPD, they have untoward cardiovascular effects. So I know that. I didn't know it was, let's see, 140% ischemic, up to 140% ischemic heart disease versus cardiovascular disease by itself. So I knew was more, I didn't know it was that much more."
Think differently about COPD? Not really. No.
"Damage from COPD exacerbations goes beyond the lungs. So that's nice, the statement. Is increased following moderate exacerbation. I didn't know that, that that's related to MI or struggling related to moderate exacerbation. Risk of MI doubles within five days. Is that true? I mean, where did that come from?"
That the risk of MI doubles within five days.
"That's 2.27. That's confidence level, so that's highly significant. 40% increase in stroke within 10 days. I didn't know that either. There was a direct relationship with having exacerbation of COPD and having a stroke. I didn't know that."
"It's new information. I mean, I didn't really think of it that way."
"Try and control it as best you can. And also... You're talking about, this is people that have no previous history of MI or stroke, or this is just people that have COPD without any previous history that we're talking about?"
"Make sure that they're on the proper medications, that their lipids are controlled. I mean, they're not smoking, they're following a diet, exercise, all this other stuff, they're avoiding stress and controlling their disease the best that you can."
Make sure they're in compliance with what they're supposed to be doing.
"Controlling their blood pressure, if they have diabetes, making sure their diabetes is under control."
"Yeah, I guess you really can't tell them when they come into the office that after they have an exacerbation, your risk of having a heart attack or stroke is going to be increased in the next seven to 10 days or one to five days. I mean, that would probably be too much information for them."
Product X reduced the risk of all cause mortality versus... Reduction in mortality. Okay.
A triple therapy or Product X causes a decrease in all cause mortality versus dual therapy.
"I'm not sure that's true. I mean, I don't know how it's directly related, unless that the COPD is better controlled, leading to better cardiovascular outcomes. I would assume that's the whole point."
"It's positive. I mean, it's good. It's new information."
"Well, if it's true, if the study's to be believed, then I would say that probably will lead me to use more triple therapy than dual therapy."
"Yeah. Besides compliance, obviously, and symptom control, to decrease all cause mortality."
"It would probably need a larger study. I mean, 80 is not that many patients. But as far as the size of the study, I'm not even familiar with the study, but-"
"Exactly what that means, you mean you treat 80 people to get benefits? What does that mean?"
"Not related to COPD, related to other diseases. I mean, talking about LDL cholesterol or something else not really related to COPD."
"Using concept to... Number needed to treat, the 80. I mean, to reduce all cause mortality in one person, or does that mean over the course of other patients that I see? What does that mean?"
"Do have to treat 80 patients to get a decrease in all cause mortality for one patient? Or do I get a decrease in most of the patients that are treated with triple therapy, or is it only for one patient versus 80?"
Cardiovascular causes appeared accounts for majority-
Treatment difference from Product X versus  inaudible 00:38:36 . Product X also is lower... Cardiovascular causes account for majority of mortality. Mortality treatment difference. I don't know what that... That seems confusing. Majority of the mortality treatment difference. What does that mean? Majority of the mortality treatment difference for Product X.
"All cause cardiovascular, respiratory pneumonia, cancer. Yeah. Well, I mean, according to this chart, the majority of the mortality is due to cardiovascular causes. So the triple therapy reduces that from... So that's a great decrease. I understand that's a positive benefit."
"Well, major adverse cardiovascular event. Product X is in red, so it decreases the mace, decreases nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke. They're all positive except for nonfatal stroke. I don't how nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke. You would wonder why it causes relative increase in nonfatal stroke if it's an inhaled steroid. But anyway, it's mostly positive, I would say."
"That it decreases all cause mortality, the triple therapy versus the dual therapy, either LABA, LAMA or steroid with the long-acting beta agonist. So that's a positive. I didn't really realize that it was broken down that way. I mean, that COPD causes that."
"That's good information to have. I mean, I didn't really realize it in that light, that Product X would cause decrease in cardiovascular mortality to that extent."
"Well, I would utilize that agent, Product X, to a greater extent than I use triple therapy now."
Product X showed reduction in cardiovascular deaths versus LAMA-LABA.
"Yeah, because it's a higher percentage. I mean, there were a lower percentage of cardiovascular deaths, so that even makes it a stronger point."
"Well, so more protective, prevents cardiovascular death, the triple therapy versus just a dual agent."
"That's another reason to prescribe or to have the patients use it, certainly."
"Especially in an elderly population. I mean, I'm not sure I would use it in somebody who's 30 years old or something. We're talking about people that are elderly, I would certainly use it more preferentially than a dual agent."
"Not really worried about cardiovascular deaths in a 30-year-old or a 35-year-old or a 40-year-old. I mean, I have to take age into a factor."
"Angiotensin receptor inhibitor, mortality with single inhaler triple therapies. What is that? I don't know what they're talking about, really."
"I know what SGLT inhibitor versus placebo for ACE inhibitors. I'm not familiar with the ARR. I mean, I know what the-"
"That's a good question. Magnitude, mortality with single inhaler triple therapy similar to observed. I'm not sure what it's trying to tell me."
The whole concept is foreign to me. I'm not really sure what you're referring to.
"I know what angiotensin is. I know what angiotensin receptor is. I know what a neprilysin inhibitor is, but I'm not sure about mortality related to that concept."
"Oh, that's what ARR means, absolute risk reduction?"
"Okay. Well that maybe should say that instead of ARR. Absolute risk reduction for mortality in single inhaler triple therapy, similar to observant. Magnitude of ARR for mortality in triple therapy, similar to observed in landmark. I still don't understand what the sense... What does that mean? It's similar to that observed in landmark cardiovascular trials."
"Oh, I see. Yeah. Well, that sentence should need to be clarified. It doesn't make..."
"If it's true, then that would lean towards using triple therapy as a preferential therapy for people with COPD. I don't think this would mean that you would stop using the other agents for people that are controlled cardiovascular wise, but for people with COPD, would tend to use the triple therapy versus the dual therapy and getting additional cardiovascular benefit."
"Very, because I didn't realize that the risk reduction is equal or similar to those using statins or SGL2 agents or an ACE inhibitor. I didn't know it had that much of a positive effect."
"It'd be great. I mean, that would tend for me to use a triple therapy preferentially over dual therapy."
"Well, if the slides are be believed, then there's no downside to, using triple therapy and there's a positive cardiovascular mortality data using triple therapy, why wouldn't you use a triple therapy instead of using dual therapy?"
Because you have better compliance and you have positive cardiovascular profile.
"That makes it a more direct link. I mean, I knew there was a link, but I didn't know it was to that extent, where we talked about, it was twice the episode of having an MI or a stroke within 10 days after having exacerbation. I didn't really think about it in those terms."
"It would mean I would have an agent that would decrease their cardiovascular mortality when they have a COPD exacerbation. Or using it for just regular COPD without the exacerbation, it would help them provide benefit to their life."
"Unmet need? Well, if we're talking about decreasing the cardiovascular mortality, yes, I would. Yes."
"Hi, and thank you all so much for waiting. We have the respondent on the line now. Mindy, you may begin."
"Yeah, sure. So I'm a pulmonologist who runs a large community advanced lung disease health program. I take care of advanced lung disease ranging from obstructive diseases like advanced asthma and COPD to ILD and PAH, kind of am a referral center for all those kinds of diseases that nobody else in pulmonary wants to take care of because they're beyond just the standard first line stuff."
"Yeah, I mean, I basically follow the GOLD guidelines, right? So we're going to start with LAMA, quickly move to LAMA/LABA, and then patients who are failing LAMA/LABA in terms of symptomatology or patients who have frequent exacerbations, the GOLD stage Ds are going to get triple therapy."
"Unfortunately, the region of the country that I'm at there's not a lot of access to pulmonary rehab and then all the attendant supportive care for these patients in terms of vaccinations, smoking cessation counseling, supplemental oxygen use, et cetera."
"So the evaluation for unexplained shortness of breath is going to begin by a careful history, right? Based on what their risk factors are. So if they're never smoker, I'm not going to be chasing COPD. If they've had asthma forever by report, but never have spirometry, I'll focus on that. If they've got exertional dyspnea, joint issues, rash, I'll be working them up for interstitial lung disease. It all kind of depends. All of them are at some point going to get a baseline chest x-ray and PFTs."
"So again, it all depends on the history, right? I see plenty... I would say half the patients sent to me for unexplained dyspnea, it's a cardiac cause. So either I will just send them back to cardiology based on the story, like I have exertional chest pain or I wake up in the middle of the night short of breath after lying on... I can't lie flat on three pillows, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'll just proceed there. A lot of times it's the cardiologist that's seeing them, thinks their shortness of breath is out of proportion to their cardiac disease, and so they're going to again get routine chest x-rays and PFTs just to say to the cardiologist,  inaudible 00:05:53  back at you."
"And in most cases, the chest x-ray shows pulmonary edema and the cardiologist has to realize that they're dealing with diastolic dysfunction."
"Correct. Well, and again, I mean, there are plenty of people who come to me for unexplained dyspnea and I will order the echo because I'm convinced that's what it is, but I will send them to cardiology on the way with an echo."
With or without COPD or pulmonary disease? I'm not sure what you're asking.
  00:06:53  So if I'm evaluating a patient-
"... Yeah. And again, by cardiovascular I'm assuming you mean not hypertension, but you mean coronary artery disease slash angina or heart failure.   00:07:05  That's not what I treat for a living, so I send them back to their primary care provider who can determine if he or she wants to handle it or if wants to send them to a cardiologist."
"I treat them appropriately, if I've defined COPD based on the spirometry."
"I mean, the risk factors are similar. Although just playing the odds, given what the rate of smoking is in this country versus the rate of hypertension, and coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia, and obesity, there's a lot more cardiovascular disease in the world than there is emphysema and COPD."
"So if someone has both, I will manage the obstructive lung disease component and defer the management of the cardiovascular component to either their primary care provider or cardiologist, because I don't want to be responsible for managing their afterload reduction, their anti-anginals, and their diuretic. Now, if they end up having heart disease because they have advanced lung disease, I have plenty of patients who I've followed for years who have progressive lung disease from any number of causes and develop the heart failure from the progressive lung disease, or they develop heart failure from pulmonary artery hypertension, those I keep and manage because that's my lane."
"  00:08:42  So again, it depends on why they developed the cardiovascular disease, right?   00:08:43  So if they develop the cardiovascular disease just because of pure hypoxemia and right ventricular failure, then I'll take care of it. But if they develop left ventricular failure from their hypertension and obesity, then I'll let the cardiologist manage it."
"Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, congestive heart failure."
My clinic is busy enough with just pure respiratory stuff that I don't have time to see people once a week or once a month to reevaluate their diuretic or their afterload reduction. That's what primary care doctors are for.
"Again, when there was concern about the interaction with LAMAs and cardiovascular risk, I think there was a little bit of thought about that, but that was quickly dealt with, with a well done large, 18,000 person New England Journal study, and that went away. And given that we do not have conclusive evidence, despite what some manufacturers would like to prove or claim that inhaled corticosteroids reduce cardiovascular issues in patients with COPD, it doesn't really come into play. I treat them really based on the way the guidelines say in terms of how I reserve inhaled corticosteroids."
"I don't say, oh, you really would just get dual LAMA/LABA therapy, but because you have hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and angina, I'm going to add an inhaled corticosteroid earlier to your regimen because of your underlying cardiovascular risk profile. That's always been the holy grail of the inhaled corticosteroid argument in this disease state. And even if you look at the more recent stuff that's been published in The Blue Journal, which are secondary analyses of some of the closed triple therapies versus competitors that suggest there's a signal, it's very subgroup of a subgroup kind of signal."
"Right.   00:11:50  They're not my diseases to manage. Right, they're not my diseases to manage. The interventions I have in terms of therapy don't either exacerbate or ameliorate those cardiovascular issues based on the current level of our understanding. Now, that may change in 20 years, but again, the inhaled corticosteroid debate in COPD has been fought back and forth between any number of authors over two decades in my academic career, when I had one. And then the need for supplemental oxygen, which is really one of the only life preserving therapies we have in COPD, is not altered by the underlying presence of cardiovascular disease or not."
"Smoking, hypertension, obesity, hyperlipidemia."
How do I feel in terms of managing the COPD aspect of their disease?
  00:13:39  It doesn't alter my approach to therapy. I think I just said that.
"So again, whether they have cardiovascular disease or not does not alter my stepping up of therapies from LAMA, to LAMA/LABA, to triple therapy, whether it be open or closed. And so I basically follow the GOLD guidelines, which are the internationally established guidelines and such that initial therapy for mild to moderate, kind of A or B is going to be LAMA, maybe LAMA/LABA. If they're not having their symptoms controlled on LAMA, they're going to go to LAMA/LABA, and if they're on LAMA/LABA and they're not having their-"
  00:15:18  There's very... The only communication is through the electronic medical record.
"It's very siloed and again, we even have studies that suggest that the use of beta blockers in COPD patients is not a concern in any way and it may actually even be helpful in COPD patients in terms of managing their cardiovascular disease beyond what we would normally expect. So again, a lot of the concerns that were previously theoretically thought to be crosstalk issues between cardiac medicines and COPD or COPD meds and cardiac disease have really not born out to be issues in reality."
"Like I said, when they're seeing a patient who has dyspnea kind of symptoms that they do not think are explained by their cardiovascular disease."
"So again, just to reiterate the point I made earlier, there has been a long time concern about a connection between COPD and cardiovascular disease in that COPD is a pro-inflammatory state, those cytokines leak in from lung into the cardiovascular system. COPD has generally also been associated with mild hypercoagulability, if you kind of look for it, and so there's been a thought that there's been an interaction between COPD and cardiovascular disease. And the literature really suggests that patients who have concomitants say, coronary artery disease and COPD, do worse than patients who would have just coronary artery disease without COPD."
"It's very hard to tease out from those things though how much of it is due to the addition of COPD or just the interaction of other risk factors that go along with the two diseases. And again, that's why if you look at a lot of the data that originally came out of large datasets from Canada, there was some suggestion that the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients who had concomitant COPD and coronary artery disease was associated with better outcomes. The search for that in randomized controlled trials has been difficult to demonstrate and also has to be weighed against the data that pretty conclusively showed that inhaled corticosteroids in COPD patients are associated with some degree of a risk for pneumonia."
"  00:18:44  My perspective, given the absence of convincing evidence, is that the burden of proof is on the part of the people who advocate for steroid use earlier in patients with concomitant risk factors to show me the data. And again, if you look at the most recent publications from let's say, The Blue Journal, one of our leading journals where they've done a lot of subgroup analysis of the closed triple therapy studies versus some of the other studies which are using open therapies or just dual therapies, like LAMA/LABA, ICS versus LAMA/LABA, and the ones that show a kind of general mortality benefit, they allege that's all due to the cardiovascular risk. But when you look at the analysis to really demonstrate it, it's at best hypothesis generating, it's not conclusive."
"All right. So that's lung health, three year scope, TORCH and UPLIFT. That's established."
"Yeah. We know cardiovascular disease is what people die of in COPD. They don't just die of COPD. But remember, each of these diseases had a two year to three year follow up, so there wasn't enough time for people to die of cancer."
So it kind of confounds that. It depends on what your time horizon is.
"Right. So again, we're showing a lot of associations, but that doesn't necessarily demonstrate causation."
"Show me a randomized controlled trial in the patients with cardiovascular disease, randomized to some intervention for COPD or some placebo, and that show me over a five year time horizon that it reduces all cause mortality or some pooled endpoint of all cause mortality, cardiovascular event, or stroke."
"Yes. We knew this as well. Right? Yeah. Although, I think it's fascinating.   00:22:50  I think it's fascinating that you have no reference for this data on the slide."
"And more importantly, I think it's kind of disingenuous, if not misleading to say the difference at six to 10 days. You're implying that it's different, but you're putting in a tiny little footnote that says it's not different."
And that's just deceitful and I could not imagine that you could get this through a regulator.
"Okay. But again,   00:23:41  if it's not statistically significant, you shouldn't show a bar graph suggesting it is when it isn't. Because days one through five is different from days six through 10, and the way you've displayed the data is not... The way to display the data would be to actually show it as a Kaplan-Meier, so you're not playing fair with the data."
"And again, what's interesting is that as I recall this has not been shown with severe exacerbations."
"Right. And that's kind of interesting   00:24:27 , because why would it only happen with moderate and not severe exacerbations? Which again, underlies why there's skepticism about a biological link."
"Right? If it's a function of exacerbations, it shouldn't be a function of the severity of the exacerbation, it should be a function of exacerbation. Or if anything, you would expect the dose response effect, whereas as the exacerbation got worse, the impact on MI, and cardio, and stroke got worse as well."
"So again, that's why this whole literature is a  inaudible 00:25:00  and there isn't consensus."
"  00:25:11  I think it would be... Again, I think it would add to biological plausibility in terms of an underlying link."
"Well again, you could argue that for several reasons. One is because they didn't have a large enough sample size of severe exacerbations in their data set to look at it. Two, it could be because if you're having a severe exacerbation, you're dying of the severe exacerbation, so you're not living long enough to be able to get that. Right? You're not..."
You're not able to actually have... The people aren't living long enough to get it.
"This is the BREZTRI data. This is the closed triple for that combo versus product, what product X is, right?"
"Sure. Right. Which I also thought you told me this wasn't going to be more for... Whatever. So again, this is all cause, mortality. And again, it's not a fair comparison. It's showing the step up of mortality risk as you're giving something. And again, what I think is important is your little footnote there, which is these numbers aren't different versus ICS-LABA."
Right? So it's only different versus LAMA/LABA.
"And so again, the other thing is this doesn't tell me how many patients had underlying cardiovascular risks. And again, this is also all cause mortality over the one year study."
"... Well, the bigger question is what does it tell us about early use of triple therapy versus dual therapy either is LAMA/LABA or ICS-LABA. And again, if you look at the clinical trial that both of the closed triples were approved on for COPD, and this is more so an issue in TRELEGY trial, they basically took people who were on open triple and then randomized some of them to closed triple or just dual therapy. And so it wasn't that closed triple was doing so well, it was that you were taking away from a bunch of patients during the washout period their standard of care, and so they had rebound hypercoagulability and rebound inflammation. And if you actually read the editorial for TRELEGY that came with the New England Journal paper, it makes that point quite clearly."
"  00:29:11  No. I mean, the curve is going to... It's the data. The question is why is it the data, right? What's the biological underlying mechanism that explains this?"
"And it's very hard to tease out what this might be due to because the other thing of course, what you see is the exacerbation numbers are a little bit different, but they're not as striking as the risk of all cause mortality. And so it takes away and undermines the hypothesis that it's exacerbation prevention, which would be driving a mortality benefit."
"So again, you can show pieces of the data, but you need to look at it in its totality to really understand it."
"Well, I mean, it's a reasonable... I mean, again, we don't have ever... We have never developed a pharmacologic therapy for COPD that improves mortality, so a number needed to treat of 80 is pretty reasonable. Right? But again, the other thing is also looking at the baseline characteristics of this population, because knowing the details of this clinical trial I have a lot of patients on LAMA/LABA who don't look like the patients who are enrolled in this trial. So it gets back to the distribution of potentially cardiovascular risk factors or other risk factors for mortality that are in the baseline characteristics of this study versus what are the baseline characteristics of the population I treat."
"Right. And again, the fascinating thing is how low the risk of death is in general in this very sick population, right? Over a year, you're taking what is supposed to be moderate to severe as COPDers and the mortality rates on baseline LAMA/LABA is only 2%, which is pretty good. And again, if you're looking at cardiovascular, you're looking at an absolute risk reduction of 1%, getting you to a number needed to treat to prevent a cardiovascular death of over 100, which actually becomes kind of challenging."
"So again, we just don't understand because we don't know what the risk factors are because as we're looking at some of these events, the risk factors for non-fatal stroke or a non-fatal MI are different than the risk factors for cardiovascular death or any confirmed MACE. And so now that you're looking at subgroup kind of outcomes, you're kind of doing a lot of post hoc analysis, which is why this paper ended up in a second tier pulmonary journal and not a first tier journal."
"Again,   00:32:29  it moves the burden of proof and does suggest that in this kind of population inhaled corticosteroids may have some cardiovascular protective effect in patients who've already... Again, to be in this trial, as I recall, you had to have had an exacerbation, you had to have moderate to severe COPD, it was a very... It's not what all cause, all comer COPD patients look like."
"  00:32:51  And the number needed to treat is... The number needed to treat is actually getting... When you're getting to a number needed to treat of 100, you're getting to be something that's a challenge."
"So again, as I said, the difference in terms of death... And again, these are all adjudicated by a blinded evaluation panel, which is always hard to do because I've done those evaluations. You're looking about an absolute risk reduction of about 0.9 between the non-ICS containing compounds and the ICS containing regimens, which suggests that there may be some treatment benefit, but the number needed to treat is now at about 120, suggesting that at most it's small. And again, remember, we're looking at a very... It's the same population for CV events. You're looking at a very narrow population of patients that is not the whole world of even moderate COPD or severe COPD because to get into this trial, you had to have had at least an exacerbation in the last 12 months as I recall."
"So again, I've got a lot of people on triple therapy, but I've got plenty of patients. I've got 20-30% of my patients are just dyspneic who are doing fine on LAMA/LABA and don't have exacerbations."
"Because also, recall what we know about exacerbations is the biggest, and this gets back to a lot of work Glaxo did 15 years ago, the biggest predictor of an exacerbation in COPD is prior exacerbation. And there is an exacerbator phenotype and a non-exacerbator phenotype."
"And so I have plenty of patients who are the non-exacerbator phenotypes who I may be adding an inhaled corticosteroid, not because of exacerbation, but as a last ditch effort to try and help with symptomatology."
"Again, it's called external validity or generalizability and that's... What's missing here is describing the entry criteria for this trial and what the actual baseline characteristics of the population are."
  00:35:24  I don't know what else you want me to say.
"  00:35:35  So again, I said, I think there is something to the story in a select and narrow population about a cardioprotective effect of inhaled corticosteroids, but that in this population, most seems small."
"Right. And the key phrase there is the unadjusted P value, because it's adjusted for baseline risk factors that are important, that drive CV deaths."
"Right? And if you actually... And again, there may be signal here, but it's small."
"Because again, the number needed to treat... Again, you're showing relative risk reduction as opposed to absolute risk reduction, the absolute risk reduction, and this is a classic pharma maneuver, let's emphasize the relative risk reduction and not the absolute one. The absolute risk reduction is relatively small and you've conveniently left out the number needed to treat for cardiovascular death, which here is going to be about 110 to 120."
"  00:37:42  I did my math right, I said 120 and it's 121. That's pretty good. I can do the math in my head. So again, this is now comparing... This slide is not even comparing apples and oranges, it's comparing apples and wood. Right? The  Triple S 00:37:54  study done 30 years ago looked at a very different risk. I mean, again, it gets back to generalizability, statins versus placebo in the population that was studied was primary prevention without many cardiovascular risk factors. Right? Right. HOPE looked at a different population and the SGLT2s, I really hope you want to do better than them because at the price they're in, no one's going to... Getting those approved for patients with heart failure is a pain in the ass. Right? And that's looking at a very, very high risk population and the NNT is 119. So again, what you don't have across a third axis here is cardiovascular risk over the next five years."
"And again, the duration of therapy, so trial Y or trial X are 52 week studies, the four cardiovascular studies you've picked are not 52 week studies as I recall."
"So the average... Again, it's not a fair time of the observation. And again, if you took this to the regulators at the agency, I cannot believe that they would let you... I mean, even if I was at a CME talk and I showed a slide like this, I would get stoned."
"Because it's not a fair comparison, it's interesting and it's an interesting discussion point, and this is a fascinating hypothesis, but we're not there yet, at least for this argument. There are lots of reasons to use triple therapy. I don't think this is going to drive one. And I don't think this data is going to change the GOLD guidelines to say earlier triple therapy is better."
"I mean, Triple S was done when I was a resident."
"No, not at all. And understand that, at least in the vast majority of the world right now, which triple therapy a patient can get in terms of a closed triple therapy versus open, and then which closed triple therapy is driven almost entirely by their health insurance in terms of the PBM. And it's very convenient to show 80 and 121, but not show the confidence intervals around those numbers because those numbers overlap. And even if they didn't overlap, the baseline characteristics of the TRELEGY trial versus the BREZTRI trial are not comparable. So it's a fundamental flaw in terms of presenting evidence based data to compare Y to X in the way that you're doing on that slide."
"I think the data's supportive of a reduction. I think it's unclear, but I think it's a reason to use triple therapy in the population that's equivalent to the one that was studied in the trial. I'm not going to look at a patient who I meet, who's got an FEV1 of 60%, gets better with a LAMA, and feels fine, and can go back and golf or play squash, and just throw them on triple therapy."
"No. I think I kind of illustrated at the beginning of our conversation that it's something I'm kind of pretty familiar with and I've thought about. I'm actually disheartened that someone from pharma would think that this would be appropriate in terms of these comparisons, because it's... I don't know who they're listening to at an ad board, but this is not the way to think about the data."
Okay. Can I put you on mute for one second?
"Sure. I'm triple trained, internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine. Triple board certified, been practicing for 30 years. Spent majority of my career in academia with students, residents, fellows. The last four plus years, I've  inaudible 00:03:23  working in a suburban community tertiary care hospital, where I practice inpatient pulmonary, outpatient pulmonary, and inpatient critical care. That's the short story."
"COPD, probably I would say 70 or so, more or less."
So closed or open triple therapy or both?
"Closed triple therapy, open triple therapy, or both?"
"Of the hundred, I probably have 40 on triple therapy."
"Triple therapy is what I recommend for any of my patients who are severe or very severe COPD patients. The moderate patients, I decide whether they should be on triple therapy based upon a bunch of different factors like their cat score, their MMRC, and their pulmonary function tests."
"Escalation to triple therapy is primarily based upon symptoms and other things like oral corticosteroid use, rescue use, ER visits, office visits, admissions for exacerbations."
Any patient short of breath or someone who... Not just COPD?
"Sure. I mean, everybody starts off with a PA and lateral view of the chest, and a complete history and physical examination, and complete pulmonary function testing, including lung volumes and diffusing capacity. Once I get to do those three things and they're all done simultaneously in one visit, then I decide where we need to go from there."
"So, it's an interesting question because when someone is short of breath, the two most likely suspects are the heart and the lungs, and I get a fair number of referrals from my cardiology colleagues. The ones that come to me from cardiology, they're already worked up for cardiac and they got sent to me because they found nothing. I will send to the cardiologist if I work somebody up for pulmonary and I find nothing."
"So, I don't do the cardiac workup myself. The only typical cardiac test I may do, as part of the pulmonary workup, is an echocardiogram and an EKG, just because pulmonary hypertension is within the purview of both pulmonologists and cardiologists. So, I will sometimes do a transthoracic echocardiogram and an EKG, depending upon what the complaints are, what the history, and what the physical exam shows."
"So, if the person was sent to me by a primary care doctor, in order to be politically correct, I'll call the primary care doctor and say, ""Mr. So-and-So is in the office and I got his echo result back, and he has apical and septal hypokinesis, and I'm worried about whether there's underlying coronary disease. Which cardiologist would you like me to send Mr. So-and-So to?"""
"If it's someone who came to me because they saw my name on Google, then I'll pick the cardiologist I send them to. I'll call the cardiologist and say, ""Listen, I have this patient in my office. I think he may have a coronary disease, his echo is very abnormal. Can you see him today or tomorrow?"""
"That's right, because otherwise if I step on somebody's toes, I don't get another patient from that person."
"I will initiate treatment and I will follow them longitudinally. If they're mild cases, one to two times a year. If they're moderate cases, two to four times a year, and if they're severe cases or it's very severe, four to six times a year. Again, barring any exacerbations, et cetera."
"I would say about 50%, and the most common would be some sort of CKD, heart failure, diabetes."
"I think anything cardiovascular or vascular. A large number of the COPD patients, as you can imagine, have smoked cigarettes. So, people who smoke cigarettes get coronary disease, but they also get peripheral vascular disease. So, I think cardiac and vascular people who have those comorbidities, those are the ones that are most concerning to me. Diabetes, it's not going to kill them. Depending upon what type of heart failure they have, it's probably second on the list, and I would include heart failure as part of cardiac anyway."
I don't manage people's CKD. I don't manage their diabetes. I don't manage their heart failure.
"I think there are some concerns that I always take into account, particularly if someone has arrhythmias. So, may use as a rescue, for example, a short acting muscarinic agent without a short acting beta agonist. If someone's got a history of rapid atrial fibrillation or a history of some other super ventricular attack arrhythmia, or even ventricular tachycardia, so I will certainly take that into account."
"As far as things like coronary diseases, again, as it relates to the potential side effect of beta agonists to cause tachycardia, I do bear that in mind. And at the end of the day, I make an assessment as to whether the risk of a beta agonist in someone who's got a history of coronary disease and a stent is more beneficial to the patient, than the potential deleterious effect of causing a tachycardia with a stent in place is an example."
"It really depends upon what classes of medication I'm using. So, if I'm treating someone for pulmonary hypertension, I'll be very cognizant of giving them vasodilators, depending upon whether or not I know the etiology of their pulmonary hypertension, is an example, to the extent that those are comorbidities that could potentially have cardiovascular etiologies. Yes, I will because, for example, if someone has pulmonary hypertension because they have left side heart failure, that's not the kind of person I want to put on a PDE5 drug, for example, because it might kill them."
"Yeah. I mean, I don't use theophylline. If I use theophylline, I would have a little bit of that to talk about, but because I never put anybody on theophylline, it's not a concern. If I did, I would worry about theophylline toxicity, and malignant arrhythmia is associated with theophylline toxicity, but because I don't use it, it's kind of a nonissue."
"Known cardiovascular, is that what you said?"
"There are people who got COPD from occupational exposures. I have patients who were down at 9-11. I have some patients from parts of the country, Virginia, Pittsburgh, where they were working in coal mines. And every now and then I have a young person with Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. But for the most part, my COPD patients have gotten COPD from smoking."
"So, it depends what their cardiovascular disease is. If they have something like pulmonary hypertension as a result, I try to work with the cardiologist to see if it's from the heart or if it's from the lungs. If they have coronary disease, I will work with the cardiologists about things like beta blockers, which have some relative contraindications with people with Bronchospastic type of pulmonary disease. Again, someone who has COPD and pulmonary hypertension, who I may want to put a calcium blocker on for pulmonary hypertension, if they have a vasodilated trial that's positive, I would discuss those with the cardiologist."
"Again, only the presence of arrhythmias, which would have me just trying to work out in my own mind, whether the risk of a beta agonist was greater than the benefit that a beta agonist may provide in giving short term relief."
"Again, it depends what the cardiovascular disease is. Patients with, for example, severe systolic heart failure, it's not uncommon for us to be unable to really determine whether they're short of breath from their heart failure or from their COPD. So, I think systolic heart failure patients present a bit of a problem, and it is one of the cardiovascular comorbidities that some my patients who have COPD have."
It depends upon how well their cardiovascular disease is being controlled.
"So, if they're coming to me every two months, like I request, but they see their cardiologist once a year, then the answer is no."
"In other words, patient had never seen a cardiologist, came to me for COPD evaluation and I found an echo that looked like this person had ischemic cardiomyopathy. That's who goes to the cardiologist."
I'm not going to send  inaudible 00:21:15  with CV risk factors to a cardiologist to go back to the primary care doctor.
"Yes. Yeah, so some of the cardiovascular drugs have pulmonary toxicities, and I will get referred. I'll just give you an example, amiodarone is a drug that's used to treat atrial fibrillation, and it causes pulmonary fibrosis. So, it's not uncommon for a cardiologist to have a pulmonologist follow those patients with serial pulmonary function tests and, or serial CAT scans."
  00:22:10  progressing or something like that.
It depends upon how impaired their lung function is.
"I think they're substantial because as I mentioned before, the majority of COPD patients smoke or have smoked, and guess what one of the biggest risk factors for cardiac diseases is, smoking. So, to the extent that they are kind of connected at the hip as risk factors for the same types of diseases, they really have quite equal importance in assessing risk factors."
I'm not sure it could increase the risk. I think it can increase-
"It certainly can influence it because if someone with COPD developed hypoxemia and you have coronary disease, hypoxemia is not good for people with coronary disease."
I don't think they're related in that way.
"No, they have nothing to do with each other."
"I mean, in my experience it's mostly the cardiovascular disease worsening their COPD, and not the other way around."
"I think that, for example, someone who's got frequent heart failure exacerbation, in filling up the interstitium of their lungs with fluid, because the heart's not working so well, is not good for people's lungs."
"Not unless there's severe hypoxemia, and those happen every now and then, but just someone coming in with Bronchospasm, so long as oxygen saturation is good, it's not really causing a tremendous amount of trouble."
"I mean, I'm not surprised by anything that's here. I think that, as I mentioned before, patients who get COPD smoke, and people who smoke get heart disease and they get lung cancer or cancer. So, I'm not surprised that at least in the first two, the two highest columns are heart disease and cancer. Then in the last two, they're second to respiratory related. It's interesting that the last two have more respiratory related causes. I don't remember how they documented the causes of death in these two trials, but if they use that certificate information, we know how notoriously inaccurate that is."
"But still, it still shows a significant amount of patients in the last two trials with cardiovascular disease and with cancer."
"I think both columns show that if you have both of these problems, that really poses a significant impact on your risk of mortality. I think you've already known this."
"So, I understand the MI stuff, I'm not sure I understand the stroke stuff. It's   00:30:11 ."
"Well, I mean, tell me what COPD does that puts you at risk for a stroke."
"Just to me, it sounds like it could be true to an unrelated."
"Sure. So, you're not going to get Carotid artery stenosis from COPD. If you're not in atrial fibrillation or in arrhythmia that puts you at risk for an atrial ventricular thrombus, you're not going to stroke. So, I'm wondering what the risk factor for a stroke is, because C O P D itself is not necessarily a risk factor for a stroke. Cardiac disease is, but C O P D itself as an independent risk factor for a stroke?"
"  00:31:16 . But if you're saying it's an exacerbation, you're saying it's because of the disease."
  00:31:22  this is... It says   00:31:24 .
"So, you're saying it's from COPD, and stroke   00:31:37 -"
"Again, so my reaction is that it's interesting, but to me it's probably true to an unrelated."
"I certainly don't see the statistics here. I don't see the number of patients. I don't see the severity of their diseases. I'm not seeing  inaudible 00:32:26  had comorbidities to start with. So, this is a typical graph that shows something to try to drill home a point without showing the weeds. There'll be people who will fall for it, and there'll be people who say, ""Put me in the weeds,"" and I'm one of the people who will say, ""Put me in the weeds."""
"So, looking at the number needed to treat, to save one life, is that really 80?"
Do you know what the number needed to treat in the TIMI trial was for a myocardial infarction? It was four.
"So, 80 is a very large number. And as is clearly stated below, it's not a significant reduction."
"So, I don't know. It's interesting and I think as we get more and more data on triple therapy, with trilogy and now the new AstraZeneca product, I think we're going to start to see some longer term data on things that we're kind of curious about, so I'm not surprised. One of the things this does not say is, is this across all the stages of COPD? There's stage one, stage two, stage three, stage four. It's making a statement. So, if the goal here is to say that this should be on severe and very severe patients, it should say that. If this is implying that my stage one, who's got  inaudible 00:35:57 % of 75%, should be on this, then I'm not going to buy it, especially not with the number needed to treat being 80. To save-"
It doesn't help because I don't know what their FEV1s and FVCs were.
"Especially, because there's no statistical significance here."
"I think in the moderate to severe group, the message is already out about the benefit of triple therapy. So, I think this just kind of reinforces it."
"So, the message to me personally is not new."
"Yeah. So, I think that you have to have the LAMA-LABA in there, because a fair percentage of patients with moderate COPD are managed with a LAMA-LABA, because there was data in the last 10 years showing to try to keep the inhaled corticosteroid off until you absolutely had to. So, for mild patients not controlled with monotherapy and mild to moderately require double therapy, the LAMA-LABA is the go-to drug these days, not the LABA/ICS."
"So, it needs to be there. It needs to be there."
"It's not new, and if you look at the Y axis, the separation is from an absolute... It looks like it's about one and a half or something like that, so again, I'm underwhelmed."
How did they get causes of death? Is that certificates or did they review every case?
"I mean, because I see like 6,000 patients   00:39:53 ."
"Okay, so it's interesting. One could argue that an ICS/LABA is just as good as a product X, and there's, in each of the areas except for the nonfatal stroke, the LAMA-LABA does worse. It's interesting   00:40:46 -"
"Right, because of the infections related stuff. So, I think it would be very interesting to look at the respiratory deaths, and see if these columns were any different with respiratory deaths, because the reason to shy away from the ICSes was an increased incidence of pneumonia."
Right. Do we know if any of that's statistically significant?
"Okay. Just looking at it, I see 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, and I would suspect that they're not statistically significant."
I'm looking at just respiratory. Just looking at respiratory.
"I think it's interesting. I think that this, the cardiovascular stuff, many of my colleagues would find it to be new information, I think."
Yeah. It certainly has me thinking a little bit more about the LAMA-LABA as my go-to dual therapy for sure.
"No. So, I mean, I would say comparing LAMA-LABA to ICS/LABA."
"No, because you know at the end of the day,  inaudible 00:43:44  is a very clear algorithm for how I put people on triple therapy to double therapy, that double therapy information that's here that I find most interesting."
"So, is this an absolute reduction or a relative reduction?"
"Okay. So, I'm going to tell you as someone who has read countless studies and trials, absolute reduction in mortality is much more important than relative reduction in mortality, because statisticians are very good at making, if I may use a bad word, chicken salad or chicken shit."
"So, now that I'm aware that it's relative reductions, if you want to impress me, show me the absolute reductions."
"No, it reinforces the cardiovascular information that was previously shown."
"Yeah, so I'm wondering why not also putting in the information for product X and product Y, versus the LABA/ICS as separate columns."
"Sure. I'm wondering why on the right side there's not... Because you have the data, product Y versus a LABA/ICS, and product X versus LABA/ICS."
"I mean, your argument is just to get us to stop using LAMA-LABAs, I understand that, but you're not showing me the difference between the product X and product Y and the LABA/ICS."
"It's interesting. I will certainly be thinking about the next person who needs to go from monotherapy to dual therapy, as to what I'm going to pick."
"No, just because, again, I look at this as, should I just be using LABA/ICS, go back to doing what I was doing 10 years ago, which was everyone got a LABA/ICS when I needed to do double therapy?"
It doesn't make me think about it at all.
"I think we have such good data out there supporting that further COPD treatment itself. I'm not going to do a cardiac workup on everyone who has COPD who comes to my office, to see whether I should put them on a LABA/ICS versus a LABA-LAMA. The numbers are small. They're not statistically significant."
"Yeah. No, I would like to see all the primary data, all the demographics, all the baseline information on the patients, and be able to really spend some time looking at the primary data before coming to any conclusions about just what the analysis showed, which again, fraught with potential and things that would not necessarily imply reliability. And again, an example is using relative reduction in mortality."
"So I'm in a multi-specialty group, suburban location, affiliated with a community teaching hospital, in practice for 23 years."
"I mean, it's become more and more common. I'd say half of patients around multiple inhalers, half are on a single inhaler, more concerned about exacerbation prevention, so people get to triples faster."
"Oh, just trying to maintain lung function, trying to prevent early mortality, more awareness of the short and long-term impact of exacerbations."
"I mean, short-term, more accelerated loss of lung function, more prone to have future exacerbations, comorbidities play into that, and then higher mortality over the next few years."
"I mean, mostly in all the moderate and severe patients."
"Chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, frequently patients are getting CT scans either for lung cancer screening or other... They've had it at the hospital, there are lung nodules, there's pneumonia. So a lot of them have cardiologists too are following them, also doing all their usual things."
"Well, it's a mix. If they don't already have a cardiologist, I'm not shy about getting an echo and ordering a stress test. Of course, if it's abnormal, they'll see the cardiologist as a new patient, but a lot of COPD patients already have a cardiologist because they have some degree of heart disease. So there, it's kind of coordinated care."
"Well, I guess it's different groups of patients. I mean, if it's a new COPD patient, we're going to assume they don't have a cardiologist."
"Yeah. So then I may order stress test or echo if I'm suspicious of a cardiac cause for shortness of breath, but a lot of COPD patients already have a cardiologist and have had testing done."
"I mean, are we including even just high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol?"
"So, I mean, I think it's the things we just mentioned, the hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and then more concerning would be established coronary artery disease, previous MIs, stents, bypass surgery, and then there's a certain amount of depression and anxiety as well."
"Oh, probably the active coronary artery disease."
"Well, I guess that if they don't have a cardiologist, it would be making sure their blood pressure and cholesterol are under control."
"I mean, I think hopefully it's in the back of my mind most of the time and making sure their symptoms are dealt with properly."
"Yeah. I'm not sure either, but when the cardiologist tend to blame the lungs for shortness of breath and the pulmonologists tend to blame the heart for shortness of breath, but I think in general, you're trying to cover the bases and do what's right for the patient."
"I think, yeah, I think you just tend to think broadly and make sure you've got all the bases covered in terms of have you ruled out a cardiac component to their shortness of breath?"
"Hopefully somebody is, their primary doctor or their cardiologist, if they have one."
"Well, I think it's the smoking history, even if they've stopped, and the hypertension and hyperlipidemia."
"I mean, I'm comfortable with the blood pressure medications and lipid lowering medications."
"Beyond that, then it's seeing the cardiologist."
"Well, I think mostly inhalers are pretty much equivalent. There are none that are especially dangerous for cardiac patients and cardiac patients are frequently on low dose beta blockers that are still tolerated in somebody with COPD. So I feel like safety's not an issue with most of the drugs."
"Oh, I think it's just that they can be just additive that if you have cardiovascular disease, that's just an extra comorbidity that can make your exacerbations more severe or more significant."
"Well, so then I think it's just shared care, everyone's just handling their end of things."
So it is through electronic medical records. They send notes.
"Well, so that comes up... Lately, everyone's getting a corona artery calcium score, a CT scan, and frequently those show lung nodules. So then the cardiologist sends them to me or they're out of breath and they think it's not cardiac. That would be another circumstance. So those are two common situations."
I think the cardiologists just tend to manage their end of things.
"I just tend to think of it as the risk factors are the same. It's not like one's causing the other, but it's just a common pathway with similar risk factors."
I see them just as the risk factors are interrelated.
"I don't know. I just think of them as having a negative impact on each other, but I don't know if positive happens."
"I mean, hopefully it's not having a negative impact, but I don't know that it's having a positive impact."
"Well, I guess I don't know if it'll improve it, but at least it'll take out the cardiovascular risk as a potential confounding factor that makes symptoms worse."
"Yeah. I mean, so I can't think of anyone who's uncontrolled or not well-managed where I think it's having a negative impact."
"Well, I think it's not terribly surprising that cardiovascular and cancer are big players in the COPD population."
"Well, just like we said, the shared risk factors, they're frequent co-travelers. There does seem to be a lot of variability in these studies, but I think they're probably just different designs or patient groups or whatever. They weren't really designed to answer this question, but nevertheless, it's a big chunk of patients with these other mortality causes."
No. Just a reminder that you've got to see the big picture.
"So, yeah, similar to what we were saying that there's a big increase in mortality risk and cardiovascular illness."
That it's not surprising given the shared risk factors.
"I mean, it's new in terms of the numbers, but not surprising overall."
I think it just reminds you that it's in a spectrum of diseases that includes a lot of cardiac disease and cancer.
Yes. I think I've heard this before about risk of MI and stroke after exacerbations.
"Yeah. I mean, I've heard it, and I'm not sure what the mechanisms are. Is it inflammation? Is it hypoxemia? Is it unstable blood pressure? It's probably some combination of all that, but maybe there are studies that get into that. I just don't know."
"That, again, it reinforces the shared risk and cardiovascular impact of lung disease."
"Yeah. I mean, that's pretty scary too. I feel like that just can sneak up on you."
"Yeah, I think of MI as being more of a thing than stroke."
"Oh, just that the cardiac risk factors as opposed to the cerebrovascular risk factors go along with COPD."
Yeah. It's more of a global impact of the illness.
Let's see. So just impact of treatment and it's... Yeah. All-cause mortality. So trying to cover some of those cardiovascular events. So that's...
I think that... So you've got the LAMA/LABAs versus the LABA/ICS versus the triples and the triples do the most for all-cause mortality benefit.
"It reminds you... I mean, I think it's very high impact that the inhalers are doing a lot besides opening up the airways."
"It's pretty compelling. I mean, this is a big benefit that you see."
"I mean, it makes me think that patients need to be on triple therapy to get the most benefit from their inhaler."
"Well, I don't know. I'm assuming it's, like I said earlier, it's the moderate and severe patients, not the mild ones."
So that's a low number. So you're not having to treat a lot of patients to see a benefit.
So saying that somehow the inhaled steroids are doing a lot of the cardiovascular good.
"Well, just from the headline, since that's the difference between product X and the LABA/LAMA."
"Well, it's surprising. I mean, I wouldn't have thought in advance that this was the case, but as long as you're getting a benefit, the exact mechanism isn't always that important."
"Yeah, just so it's like the graph on the previous page that somehow the LAMA/LABA is the highest, and when you add the LABA/ICS, you get some benefit. Then the product X is the most benefit, but it does seem to be the inhaled steroid that's doing it."
So it makes me think the inhaled steroids are having some vascular benefit.
"Well, it just seems like the big drop off in deaths between LABA/LAMA and product X is in the cardiovascular category. It goes from 29 to 11, just echoing what we've been saying."
"Well, it's surprising, but it's going along with what we're saying, it must do some vascular good."
"Yeah. I mean, it's very compelling. It's an unexpected benefit."
"Oh, makes you think it's more of a systemic process with therapy that has benefits beyond the airway."
It makes me think you really need to have the inhaled steroid as part of the mix.
So it's mortality versus CV deaths. I think it's good to have both.
"I mean, it's an even bigger number, so why not highlight it?"
"I think it's intriguing. It's certainly an unexpected benefit. If it's this real, it's an easy thing to do."
Okay. Yeah. So stacking up well against what are felt to be standard cardiovascular treatments.
I'd say that the inhalers are quite significant compared to standard cardiovascular treatments.
This absolute risk reduction is similar in scale to what you get from ACEs and statins and so forth.
It's quite compelling. It goes along with everything we're saying.
Yeah. So fits with this whole scheme that they are as good as the standard drugs.
So it does make you think that the inhalers are doing more good than you realize in terms of cardiovascular risk factors. Some of their exacerbation prevention benefit spills over into the cardiac risk factors.
"I mean, again, make you think let's... Usually, you tend to think about maxing out the cardiac drugs in terms of cholesterol reduction and so forth, but this makes you think, ""Let's make sure we're maxed out on the inhalers."""
Makes you think there's more common ground with the cardiologist.
"Well, just that if they want to do the most good for their patients, they're going to want to make sure they're on the best inhalers, just the way I want to make sure that..."
"No, but just that it's something they should be attuned to."
"Oh, I don't know. Hopefully, there'll be publications about this or grand rounds or just a ground swell of this just becomes common knowledge and then everyone's working toward this goal."
I think just recognizing this shared exacerbation risk profile and how the inhalers benefit cardiac patients.
"Yeah, so I'm a pulmonologist part of a small single specialty group and we are located in a suburb area of New Jersey. The practice has been around for just about, I guess, 25, 28 years, something like that. I've been in practice myself for a big portion of that. And we serve a community that's kind of always asking for the latest developments in medicine. Simply, I guess the place where we located is, we're just about an hour or less away from two major academic cities in Philly and New York. So these two cities keep us on our toes and at the same time, we are lucky that we are always very informed by meeting with key opinion leaders and stuff like that. So, I'm only saying that because we consider us ourselves earlier adopters and we jump on every opportunity to try any new product or anything like that."
"Demographics in terms of gender,  inaudible 00:04:40 ?"
"So, for the CO PD, the age is most, I would say typically 90, 95% are above the age of 50. I would say a good 65 to 70% are above the age of 65 out of all those. And I would say, I can't really put a gender inequality of this. This is like..."
"Yeah. So, I'm a pulmonologist, right? So most of the cases I do see some mild COPDs, but those are mostly treated by internists. So by virtue of my practice, I tend to see more the moderates, the severe and the very severe. So as far as very severe, I would say about maybe 10% of those are very severe. Severe would be about another 25%. The moderator is a bulk is about 50%. And then the minority, maybe 10% of mild."
"All my severe and very severe are on triple therapy. My goal is to have most of my moderates on triple therapy if I can, especially if they have first exacerbation shock. So roundabout figure, I would say probably 60% around triple therapy."
"After one exacerbation, correct? Yeah. So, if I have. Or one ER visit. So it's usually either one ER visits or on the second exacerbation to be exact. So, an outpatient exacerbation on the second one. On the ER visit, I don't wait for another. So one ER, visit or two exacerbation on outpatient."
"Yeah. I know what you're saying. The first thing I tell them is to clear misconception, which is always there I would say almost a hundred percent of the time. Patients when it comes to a short of breath, they come to you because if there's a problem with their lungs. So I clear up this misconception right off the get go by telling them the shortness of breath, especially if their most predominant symptom or the only symptom. I tell them shortness of breath is an equal responsibility between myself, a pulmonologist and a cardiologist. So at the same time, as I'm doing my due diligence in working up their lungs, they essentially have to see a cardiologist to make sure that their shortness of breath has nothing to do with their heart, or it's not angina equivalent symptom."
"So that's terrifying and most of the time patients are taken aback by this because they don't expect it. From that point on, so after I get the assurance that they definitely understand that point and they're going to do it, then I start my own process. Which is usually the basic initially, which is just the basic workup. Getting a very detailed history in my opinion, is about 70% of solving the case. I mean, the tests always come. A lot of time, the clinical presentation or a good history taking gives you the whole diagnosis without any testing."
"But of course, the basic testing that I do include a basic, maybe a pulmonary function testing, some sort of imaging of the lungs. It depend if the patient is an active smoker. Immediately, I put them on a lung cancer screening cat scan. If not, and if they have symptoms that I would think that they would benefit from getting a chest x-ray, especially if I hear something in the physical exam, I get a chest x-ray. And then, if there is again, based on the history, everyone would have different added on tests. For example, a patient who had asthma before they started smoking, I want to make sure that they don't have a component of asthma with their COPD. I may do a pheno test on them, but that's not for everyone, right?"
"I always do blood work on everyone again, for the same reason because I want to make sure that there's no... This is something I started doing recently over the past several years, before the patient moves on in their clinical behavior, I always do the blood tess for the purpose of possibly identifing an eosinophilic component to their asthma slash COPD or eCOAs to try to see the benefit of maybe adding on biology in the future. That's something that I do right away, right at the beginning of the work up. And that's basically it."
If it is determined that patient has cardiovascular disease...
"Usually not. I mean, because a lot of time it's not a sharp delineation between you have it's either the heart or the lungs. I mean, again, like I said in the beginning, COPD is a clinical presentation. So, even if the patient smoked for 30 years, or a patient had asthma as a child, and it turned out that the main problem that they have right now happened to be cardiovascular in nature, that does not mean that they don't have an underlying lung disease. I'm going to have to continue seeing them. It's about dividing that pie, so to speak. Maybe 70% of their symptoms are  inaudible 00:11:40  but there is maybe 20, 30% the presenting symptoms that came acutely maybe cardiac nature. Once those are resolved, I'm going to have to deal with the remaining 20, 30% if they are there."
"Definitely 75, at least I would say again."
"All aspects of metabolic syndrome, a lot of times we're dealing with of course you mentioned cardiovascular disease, obesity, type two diabetes, sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia these are the big five and of course..."
"I would say, I mean, they're all concerning but I don't know how you can say stratify that. But always, I would say cardiovascular disease always has an edge. I mean, the other ones are more chronic conditions that usually have been going on for a while. And you can manage them more or less, but if there is an acute presentation of a cardiovascular event, that definitely takes priority."
"Yeah. So it really kind of depends. I always take ownership of their sleep apnea. That's something that I do than I treat. And over the years, one of the questions that I always get asked is, do I see primary care patients? And my answer to that is, well, every COPD patient that I see, I become their primary care for the most part. Because by virtue of their condition, they end up seeing me the most out of all other specialties because that's the one that gives them the most struggle. So a lot of times I'm finding myself managing diabetes if I need to. Again, on a small scale, nothing complicated, but I do take ownership sometimes of some comorbidities if they are easily manageable."
"I'm sorry, I missed the question. What was the first part?"
To what extent I take it into consideration?
"I always do. Like I said, right from the get go, I make them aware of that and I make myself aware of that all the time as I'm treating them because like I said, it is among all, probably the most common comorbidity with COPD so even if, sometimes like I tell you, for example, sometimes they may be an acute event that they had seen a cardiologist for and that event was resolved, and then patient tends to come now and see me as a pulmonologist and they kind of forget about the fact that they need to see their cardiologist on a regular basis because in their opinion, that problem was already solved. So I'm always making sure that they stay on top of it, getting their echocardiogram  inaudible 00:15:51 , getting whatever test if you need to."
"A lot of times it does. I mean, I would say, I'll give you an example, a very simple one. A patient who have a cardiovascular disease, who, again some of the conditions that I mentioned to you, sleep apnea, a lot of those patients are obese, they come in with atrial fibrillation, right? That's one of the symptoms of sleep apnea and hypoxia from COPD. They end up having Afib, they go see their cardiologists. I'm limited in terms of, especially if their AFib is not well controlled. For example, I try to avoid giving them a long acting, better agonist because that might be their AFib."
"So I do of course make decisions like that. Interactions between some of the medication that are given that are in nature that if they had to be on them, some of the medication that I have to give them may exacerbate some of the side effects. For example, sometimes I have LAMAs, long-lasting muscarinic patients who definitely sometimes give you dryness. A lot of patients who go to see their cardiologist are on medication that give them extremely dry mouth or a large prostate. So I try to avoid those. So there's of course, a lot of interactions between all the medications and my decision making in terms of treatment depending on the cardiovascular condition."
"Yeah. Good point. I don't think it's directly related to that fact. But the point is that, if a lot of times the ethology of the cardiovascular disease is the same in terms of causing factors. What caused the cardiovascular disease most of the time and the majority of the times is the same reason, is the same causing agent behind COPD. It's either occupational exposure or cigarette smoking. So, people who have a certain degree of severity in cardiovascular disease, usually also have a similar degree of severity in their COPD. Very hardly you see someone who has very much, I mean, I shouldn't say very hardly. Sometimes it does happen where somebody has severe heart disease and only a mild degree of COPD. And in this case, no, just because they have severe COPD and they haven't had any single exacerbation based on their history, I try to keep them on just maybe LAMA if they are well controlled, but this is, I would say unusual. Most people are already at a moderate to severe degree that would require them to be on triple therapy anyway, if they have cardiovascular disease."
What proportion of my COPD patient have cardiovascular risk factors you saying?
"I would say about 75% to maybe actually more, 80% at least."
The majority of my patient to have COPD have it secondary to cigarette smoking. So that's in and by itself. It's making it come down. Yeah.
"Yeah, it depends. I was hoping you're not going to ask me that question."
"Yeah. No, I know what you're saying. It's a very tricky question because... It's a very not tricky question, it's a very tricky situation and it kind of depends I think on the interrelations you have with the cardiologist I'm fortunate that I have developed some relations with an excellent cardiologist who has a practice need I say, who is very knowledgeable and understanding or aware, I would say of the tight relation between the heart and the lungs. And I always used to joke to cardiologist telling them, you actually only specialty in medicine who only treats half and all of them. They only treat with left disease and they leave the right heart for pulmonologist. It's just, this is unheard of."
"But some, but some cardiologists out there they do understand their concept. And I try to avoid doing the management myself, but sometimes it is capable. Sometimes I have to jump ahead, or there are some tests that otherwise, maybe should have been ordered by a cardiologist who maybe is not believing, which it's not a matter of blaming, but sometimes certain cardiologists, or sometimes if you've been seeing a patient for many years, you feel, oh, this patient has been stable because nothing is happening. When you get a fresh pair of eyes on the patient you realize there's something cardio going on, or you hear a murmur that the patient doesn't know about, or three plus edema, certain things that that could alert you."
"And in a case like that, I can initiate the cardiac workup. I can send them to have an echocardiogram. And I tell them once you get that test done, go and follow up with your heart doctor with the results. Especially if the results come back abnormal. So I do initiate sometimes for sure. Yes. And I do initiate sometimes also treatment, but not very specific treatment. I would say basic stuff or maybe the static failure or high hypertension, or maybe a little bit of  inaudible 00:22:39  to pulmonary hypertension. Things like that I feel I can manage, but I try not to step on other people."
"Yeah, of course. Again, a lot of it depends on the interpersonal relations that you develop. Some times, you have to make sure that cardiologist trust you in your judgment and they're not going to be quote unquote, afraid to send the patient. It's things like that. It's becomes a little bit of a, I don't know what to call it, minor inconsistencies I believe in the way doctors refer to each other. But like I said, most of the time when you're dealing with cardiologist that are very aware the connection between CV and COPD, I get the referrals all the time. So some of those groups that I deal with all the time, the same attitude that I have towards those patients who present with short breath, when I tell them your disease is both heart and lung related, they on their end also tell them the same thing."
"I mean, yeah, in many different ways. The work of breathing, if that's to start with number one, if your patient work of breathing because of a poorly managed COPD is severe is going to no doubt affect their cardiovascular outcome. If they have a state of chronic hypoxia that has not been addressed, if you fail to recognize that the patient gets hypoxic with exertion, that's a major situation. If the patient gets hypoxic during sleep, that's a major thing that as part of the COPD, if the patient has severe something or VQ mismatch in their lungs as a result of severe COPD, if the patient have pulmonary hypertension related to COPD, that can affect their failure. So there's so many ways in which physiologically and clinically a badly managed COPD can cause cardiovascular complications."
"Of course the treatment of  inaudible 00:25:57 , which is a very common complication of people with COPD management of pulmonary hypertension is an extremely important and nipping it down, nipping, pulmonary hypertension down. A lot of those patients do have pulmonary hypertension, and we struggle with trying to case it, or categorize it in the proper category. Is it group three, is group two, or is it secondary COPD, secondary heart disease? It's extremely important, and therefore, depending on what we believe that pulmonary hypertension is due to... We have to manage it in a, in a different way."
"Managing their atrial fibrillation could be a major reason for worsening of their shortness of breath and their COPD. Sometimes it affects it maybe in a bad way. Certain medications that patients are on for treatment of the cardiovascular disease can have a negative impact on their COPD and their shortness of breath. But in most cases, a well managed COPD with well-controlled heart rate, maximize heart function, reduction of the effects of fluid overload, if those are well managed, they'll definitely make their COPD better."
"Again, we said before, I'm not surprised cancer is included in there because there's a commonality in the closing agent, which is most of the time is really tobacco use and occupational exposure. So cancer and cardiovascular are right on top, along with the COPD. But unless you read that 39% of death are due to cardiovascular causes, it's definitely has a strong impact when you put it in a figure like that from a cohort study, or maybe I mean, whatever, it's not a cohort study, but combining all four different studies that all seem to be con coding on the results, it's an eyeopener."
"It doesn't, but it validates the way I've been practicing, honestly."
"Yeah. Okay. Again, not surprised. I mean, the only thing that I don't see, this one maybe doesn't have as strong an impact as the one... Again, it doesn't take anything away from it. The general idea is that it's beyond any doubt that the coexistence of COPD and cardiovascular disease increases the risk of mortality of cardiovascular disease as opposed to not having COPD. There's definitely no doubt about it in my mind, but maybe that slide didn't really bring it up the right way. Because with COPD alone, that range, I don't think it means anything. It's very wide and you don't know to make out of it. 40 to 140%, 30 to 90%, it fails the point, honestly. Nevertheless, it does not really affect what is the known fact which is, it does definitely increase immortality."
"Yes, I believe so, that range lacks the impact."
"What am I going to choose? 40 or 140? And if I choose 40, I can compare that to 30 or 40 from the other group. It doesn't seem to be that much of an impact. It's just that the impact is not very strong. That's what I'm saying."
"Yeah. So I am aware of that the risk of MI following in exacerbation for sure. 40% increase in risk of strokes within 10 days. I'm not sure if I was aware of that much of a high risk there, but again, not surprised"
"I was not aware of the number being 40%. I'm not sure which study that's quoting, but I'm sure it's correct. And I'm not surprised. Again, honestly. I mean, it definitely has an impact. I think it brings a little bit of a new number to my information. That 40%, I was not aware of it like that. I definitely I'm aware of the risk of MI following a COPD following the exacerbation stroke. I was not hundred percent sure of that even though I'm aware of it."
"It doesn't really... So again, like we said in the beginning, following the exacerbation, depending on how we define it, if you go by the book you're going to go with the second exacerbation. It's kind of a question of style that things have been going. Sometimes you kind of play outside the book a little bit and to be honest with you, you don't get a lot of times you play on the patient's psychology sometimes. Having one exacerbation is a good occasion that may not present itself again to get the patient to go to a different treatment that you think would be appropriate for them. It's a little bit individualized."
"In other words, I believe I told you in the beginning that I have to wait for that second exacerbation. I'm very loose on that. Sometimes patients a lot of time kind of, maybe resist a little bit change in the treatment, but when you have that exacerbation that happens, it may give you a chance that you may not have again. And that's something that would be impactful in the future, especially if you already know that your patient has to severe COPD and it's only a matter of time before they get that second  inaudible 00:35:01 ."
"It brings out the importance of the point of starting triple therapy early on by making sure that your patient with COPD has every chance to have their COPD well controlled before waiting for that cardiovascular complication to happen. From the gold standards, the paper that came out, it does definitely clearly show that there's a reduction in mortality mostly from the use of reduction in cardiovascular disease. There's a reduction in mortality in patients with COPD who are  inaudible 00:36:02  ."
"So this is something that you have to tried to implement as early as possible. And I think there is a little bit of a gray zone there as to where to start it. But I personally have anything that is already moderate with at least one exacerbation, I try to jump on triple therapy as soon as possible, essentially, to try to reduce that risk."
"It's again, a validation of a concept that is already known that everybody should be aware of. I think most pulmonologists are aware of that. I think it's a concept that needs to expand to all levels of medical specialties, especially internal medicine. There is an ingrained belief out there, or an unshakable tradition of prescribing ICS, LABAs inappropriately for a lot of those COPDS. And this is something that this is what's most what we have to deal with when patients get referred to me with their moderate and severe COPD or higher, a lot of them, unfortunately, I see that are still inappropriately placed on an inappropriate dual combination where it's LABA-LAMA or ICS-LABA for many years and they should have been updated. And usually, it's an exacerbation that brings that referral. Unfortunately, sometimes it is a little too late but, hey it's something that you have to start right away. It's no big deal. But yes, definitely validation of information we already know, and that information need to be spread out in the medical community as much as possible."
"Number needed to treat, it's 80, which is..."
I'm not sure. I don't understand. Yeah. I'm not clearly getting the concept. I'm sorry.
The difference between the different what?
"LABA and LAMA. All right. It's LABA, yeah."
"I mean, it's a number that is definitely, I would say comparable to the studies that are already published, I believe it was in the fifties range, which is basically where that is. And again, it's an important validation of the concept that we should know more and more and more and more of those studies are needed to reinforce that concept of the importance of having ICS/LABA/LAMA combination, as opposed to the inappropriate..."
"Unfortunately, what's even more inappropriate I would say, is the fact that most of those patients that need to be on ICS/LABA/LAMA, are actually not on ICS level before they come to you. Most of them are actually on the LABA/LAMA combination before they come to us, which is a concept that has been also ingrained in the community for the past several years, whereby COPD patients were for the most part, prescribes a LABA/LAMA combination with different products that are on the market, and it became almost the standard of care to put every COPD on a LABA/LAMA combination. And we did the way with the older concept that those patients had been on before that LBA/LAMA concept came through."
"Prior to those past, I would say maybe 10 years, most patients used to be on ICS/LABA. I'm talking about  inaudible 00:41:11  years, but that concept kind faded away and most of those patients we switched over from ICS/LABA to LABA/LAMA. And seeing that curve right now brings toward the importance of making that switch in those patients. Majority of them are on LBA/LAMA. The importance of making that switch to a triple therapy as soon as possible, because they are in a category where their mortality is at their highest. It's not even as urgent as if those patients were on ICS/LABA, which very few of them are now. Yeah. So, that's definitely an important part of that cure."
I'm sorry. I have to say that because one of the things...
"Correct. And these are the patients that sometimes you get a lot of pushback from. Most of them are on the LABA/LAMA and they don't want to make a switch because they feel everything is okay, and in the meantime they are in the highest risk category. So, it's a sense of urgency out out there in the COPD community to get that information out and educate all patients on and doctors about what the right therapy is."
"It's not really clear when they say product X also has lower incidence of major adverse CV events. And do they mean by that? In comparison to a LABA/LAMA combination, maybe? I'm assuming, I'm not sure."
"All right. It doesn't seem to be the case with nonfatal stroke, but definitely it was confirmed which."
"It's an interesting point. I don't know why they wouldn't have a higher incidence with triple therapy, with the incidence of non-fatal stroke, I'm not getting that. But it's... And when you combine the all total, there's no doubt about it. And I think that's what we have to focus on. You really don't want to distract any issues. I understand that's maybe an important issue with the non-fatal stroke, but the overall impact on using triple therapy on the mortality of cardiovascular, or mortality of COPD, especially with cardiovascular disease, shouldn't be tainted by any second thoughts. That's what I'm thinking. That's what I'm talking about."
"Yeah, I think it's basically just an interpretation in numbers of the same graph, right? I mean, you look at the whole cost total, you have 28, the next whole cost total is the combination of ICS/LABA and the highest whole cost tota is a LABA/LAMA, which is exactly the point I was making before."
"In the worst case scenario, there's an equivalence in all other causes except for cancer. It also seems to be a big difference, but I don't know if that is related or not. But it brings the point that the majority of the reduction in mortality comes from a reduction in the cardiovascular events."
"I don't know. They got an interesting point. I guess one of the thing is that, is the fact that with COPD with moderate severe disease, or very severe disease, they've already been maximized in their treatment and there's very little room for improvement. Or mortality, I guess from respiratory standpoint is already kind of, I want to use the word quote unquote preset I guess. There's not much improvements you can do on that. But at the same time, I'm not really exactly sure of what the addition of LAMA or triple therapy in itself, I can't say LAMA, but mostly LAMA because that's what... Or maybe an ICS rather. When you compare the difference in mortality between a LABA/LAMA and ICS/LABA/LAMA, the addition of that ICS, how is that most impactful on the reduction of cardiovascular disease just by introducing ICS, without any reduction in mortality of respiratory is a little bit puzzling because you're really not improving on the respiratory status that much, it seems."
"If you're extrapolating the fact that there is no increase in respiratory debt, if you extrapolate from that fact that there is no... That means that there is no improvement in the respiratory condition, then how is the ICS improving under cardiovascular symptoms which is a little bit puzzling. I don't think I have an answer to that. And you definitely got me thinking I'm going to explore that a little bit more."
"So, the other one is an overall mortality. This one mostly focuses on just cardiovascular death. I mean, obviously, it brings it out in a stronger perspective, pointing out the importance of adding on that ICS to strictly cardiovascular death, which makes it even a little bit more puzzling."
"The only thing I can think of in that situation is that, the adding on, which is something that always thought as being the case. Every COPD does have a component of ongoing exacerbation. Sometimes those exacerbation, they're brought forth by the patient because they are felt by the patient and they are symptomatic. But there may be some, quote, unquote subclinical exacerbations that are affecting the function of the lungs and the impact of that exacerbation either on a physiological level, or wherever microscopic level or whatever the case is. Even if it's not clinically felt by the patient, it nevertheless does have an impact on the patient's physiology of breathing. And by having an impact on physiology of breathing, it's going to affect their cardiovascular function."
"In the very the same way, that an extreme of that situation whereby the patient actually come in with a severe exacerbation to the ER, their risk of MI is increased by fold. It may be happening on a much, much smaller scale on a day to day basis whereby the patient is not really feeling it, but nevertheless, it is already impacting their cardiovascular health score, so to speak on a daily basis if you don't have that ICS added up. I think that's how I make sense of it."
"I think it's very important to bring that point up to really make it stand because otherwise, if you don't have that blue point the other part of the  inaudible 00:51:25 , the general understanding is that 49%, it may be falsely thought of as being equally mixed between cardiovascular and respiratory events. And in reality, it is not. It is almost strictly cardiovascular death."
"Again, and that's kind of makes that bridge between cardiologist and pulmonologist, even more much, much wider because both specialties need to be aware of that fact I mean, the tremendous resources, and funds, and time, and information is spent on treating condition like hyperlipidemia hypertension, and diabetes. Whereas the recognition of that concept of increased cardiovascular disease from COPD by just adding on, is really more of the concept that need to be aware of more so than pulmonologists, honestly."
"That's the risk factor to them more than it is to us, so to speak. I mean..."
"Yeah. No, I understand what you're saying. It definitely does validate what I'm already doing. But what it definitely does is to bring out, especially with this last slide, it definitely brings forth the importance of making my colleague cardiologist be very aware of this data and kind of up to this point, and I think maybe you have noticed right in the beginning, my focus was mostly on maybe more educating primary care physicians and other pulmonologists about the importance of adding on triple therapy. But I would say, with data like that, it needs to come out more strongly in the cardiovascular specialist community so that they realize the impact of dealing with those patients. That I think is the main impact of all the slides hat we've seen, especially the last one."
"It's one more factor probably in me initiating triple therapy even earlier. Like I told you, eventually my goal is to get every patient with one exacerbation and I'm tending in my practice on a daily basis almost to kind of do away with that second exacerbation as it has been suggested in the guidelines. So, it's basically, it's a situation where you have to define your COPD very early on. And I would say, even go as far as even do more of a preemptive approach. Which again, I have done a lot of times. Like I told you, with patients who I know, it's only a matter of time. You kind of maybe have, I don't know, you call it. Maybe a clinical judgment on a patient even though they are still by their pulmonary function testing or by their functional level, they'll still appear to be mild, but they seem to be definitely on the road their smoking history or their exposure or whatever the case is, that they are bound to be moderate to severe from the first exacerbation."
"Sometimes you may make the clinical judgment to put those patients on triple therapy before even that exacerbation happens because, my take on this is, you already lost one battle when that first exacerbation happens, why do you want to lose it? Try to be more preemptive. And I think it's important to identify those model patients at a point before they have their exacerbation to initiate triple therapy to prevent... That's something, obviously as clinicians, we do it right now, or I do it on my own terms. But I think in the future, this will come out as a recommendation."
"Okay. Well, I'm a pulmonologist, I'm in a small single specialty group. Large city, we're based in a residential neighborhood-"
In the city. We see a broad variety of problems typical of pulmonary disease.
Mix of office and hospital. And COPD is the single most common thing we see.
In a month could be as much as a 100. Could be a 100.
"Okay. Well, for some patients it's establishing a diagnosis. For some patients it's providing some consultative services or evaluation for patients who already have a diagnosis. And the primary physician would like some input. For some patients we encounter them in the hospital setting with exacerbation. And again, provide some consultative services to get them through their hospitalization, often with follow up on an outpatient patient. And many patients who we follow for ongoing evaluation and treatment."
"Okay. Well, generally to do whatever is necessary to establish and maintain control. And then to simplify it as much as possible. With as few drugs as possible with some reference to prevailing guidelines. That's a pretty general statement, but I can apply that to almost any disease we deal with."
"Well, I think in the simplest terms, failure of double therapy. So we have-"
"Okay. It could any of those. I mean, if somebody is on double therapy we'll get into plug in the categories of therapy right now. If it's somebody who's on LABA/LAMA and they're having exacerbations or their symptoms are not controlled, we'll add ICS. And in many cases, if they're stabilized convert that combination to a triple inhaler, if they're on ICS. LABA, then we'll do the same thing with LAMA. If they're not controlled or they're having exacerbations or they're having symptoms that are not as good as we'd like. We'll add whatever is missing of those three. And if that's effective at some point consider switching to a triple inhaler. The purpose of that in my mind is to simplify the regimen. Because the simpler the regimen, the more likely the patient is to adhere to the regimen. I don't think the single inhaler with three drugs is any more efficacious than the three drugs divided into two or three inhalers. It's just much easier for the patients."
That's right on the borderline right there.
I would say that half the patients I see are in the moderate to severe range or very severe range on triple therapy. And of those about half are on a single triple inhaler.
"Well, efficacy in terms of control symptoms, reduction of exacerbations, preservation of lung function, survival benefit and simplicity of the regimen. All of those things."
"No, not at all. In terms of using three drugs for any particular patient, it's something we've been doing for so long. And I can remember doing an interview like this one 20 years ago. And the question comes up, what's an unmet need? And I said, ""Well, a triple inhaler."""
Fit all in one inhaler. Do I have any remaining questions? Not really. Do I have any reservations?
"Reservations, not really. It has been so well integrated into our treatment and into the guidelines that I think the benefits are so clear."
"I unmuted and I remuted it. Okay, I'm sorry. Could you-"
"Okay. Well, here's advertising 101. Present the problem and preparation for solving it. I think that the overriding message here, is the magnitude of the problem. And it's presented in five different ways or six. Just how many people, how many are not diagnosed. How common it is as a reason for hospital admission, the readmission rate, its rank as a cause of death. And how many of those there are as a problem in the world. But the overriding message in here is the magnitude of the problem, which is large."
Improve the slide. It's already pretty clear.
I think it's fine. It's not difficult to understand the text and the graphics relate to each other pretty much.
"Well, I never thought about the magnitude of the problem in terms of the world. I've always thought of it in terms of the United States. So seeing those numbers, the 384 million people with COPD in the world. I never really thought about that for, that's a big number but it's believable. And 3 million deaths annually, same sort of thing."
"Just giving this a worldwide perceptiveness compared to just the United States. But thinking about that, there's nothing surprising about any of it. It's just they are the numbers."
"The variability of the burdened poverty seems to be a big driver of morbidity and mortality. Although within countries, there is going to be a lot of variability, clearly. So for example, the United States does not look all that much better than some countries which are undoubtedly not as wealthy as the United States. But the United States is a heterogeneous country in terms of socioeconomics. And I think that's a big factor as compared to someplace like Canada, which is probably more homogeneous. I have to chew on this, the upper left hand. The map of the world and the deaths from COPD per 100,000 age standardized mortality rates. So I take those to be ranges of death rate for those different color codes in purplish."
"Okay. So the countries that are really dark from 30 to 230. And then below that is everything else in intervals of about five or so. Until you get to the white way of the bottom, which may account for the appearance of the map. And that may be something to think about if this is going to be a presentation. If a country is in the 25 to 30 range, it doesn't look that different from a country that's in the 30 to 230 range."
"Well, I think the death rates per 100,000 is interesting, the one that you blew up earlier was interesting. They don't necessarily relate to individual patients. The risk factors are probably more relevant for that. And the comorbidities are certainly more relevant than either of the other two. It's all interesting though."
"Yeah. Well, I think simplify the maps. And maybe change the color coding a little bit, especially on the world map. The US does not look all that different from say Botswana."
"Exacerbations are very common, very likely and have some significant long term consequences."
"Maybe the proportion of patients who have a significant exacerbation. It probably shouldn't be surprising, but I guess I hadn't thought about that number."
"I was a little bit surprised at that, but I shouldn't be. I just need some clarification on what's meant by exacerbations are not reported. What does that mean?"
"That would be a surprise to me. But again, it depends on what you mean by not reported. I mean, if it's not reported by the patient to the doctor, that's very surprising."
I think that's what it's most likely to mean.
"Yeah. Well then there yes. The timeframe also, it might be that you have an experienced patient who knows how to manage it independently and has the tools to do it. And the next routine visit is, ""Oh yeah, I had a flare up last month and I increased this medication. And I took some steroids and an antibiotic and I felt better. I just wanted to let you know."" And then-"
"No, it's good. I mean, I think the graphics are nice. They're very nice, simple graphics that relate to what the text says. And they're all true."
Exacerbations are bad and they begin more problems.
"So below the COPD exacerbations not reported. There are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 civil human figures."
"Okay, so I can give you an interpretation of that, but I'm not sure. Okay, that could be clarified. And here's my interpretation, that's 50 to 78% of 77% of everyone."
I have to crunch the numbers to see if that works out. Or maybe the gray ones are the relevant ones. And that would be 78%. So I guess that needs to be clear... You need a key to what the colors mean for you to count.
"Because on the rest of the page, anything that relates to an exacerbation is purple. So maybe reverse those colors and then it would make more sense."
"Okay. Just the magnitude of this aspect of the problem. The proportion of patients who've had an exacerbation and the proportion who have not reported it. And that might account for decline and function that we can't otherwise explain. Just general decline in health from COPD. And that might be motivating in terms of being more... I don't want to say... Yeah, more aggressive in terms of treatment of more patients."
"Following an exacerbation there is likely not to be recovery to baseline. And that's not a new idea. It's nicely presented here, I love that lightning bolt. Also, the graphic on the right side."
"Presented in absolute numbers of milliliters, that certainly makes sense. Patients with mild COPD have more to lose. And people with severe and very severe have already lost it."
"But a different way of presenting that, could be in percentage terms. And I'll bet that would look very different. Because nine milliliters of loss of FEV1 could be a much larger percentage for somebody who is already very severely impaired. Than 83 milliliters and somebody who is only mildly impaired. Not that this is irrelevant. It's bad, it doesn't matter. I think there are two different ways to... I think there are different ways of presenting that data and the impact it might have on patients. But I think the message is clear, prevent exacerbations and it doesn't matter how you present the data. The left side, I think it's fine. Both sides make a very good point. That patients don't recover from exacerbations and lung function takes a permanent hit."
"Great. I mean, it's interesting to see the graphics are nice. It reiterates the point, but it's not something we don't already know."
"Okay. Well, any exacerbation increases the risk of future exacerbations. And multiple exacerbations increase the risk of death. And any exacerbation increases the risk of death within five years."
"It's nicely presented, but it's not news."
"Well, I think on the left you talk about risk of hospitalization on the top and risk of death on the bottom."
And the color coding is reversed on the graph on the right side.
I think some consistency there would be better.
"Just seeing it graphically. Again, just the importance of treating actively and aggressively."
"Well, that's something I haven't thought about a whole lot, because I don't treat those other problems. Those are things that are treated by other people."
Cardiovascular. So this is interesting and certainly important.
"Yes. Yes. Now one thing I would ask or suggest. Is compared to what baseline? You do that on the left. Oh no, no, no. You don't do that on the left. I think we need to know what the baseline is. So for example, on the right if there's a fourfold risk of a cardiovascular event in the first 30 days after an exacerbation. How many people does that happen to, without an exacerbation? How many patients with COPD have such an event without an exacerbation? So I'm asking for what proportion of patients with COPD who have not had an exacerbation or a stroke or myocardial infarction in 30 days, for any year."
"Is that one in 10,000? Is it one in a 1,000? Is it 50 out of a 100? What's the number?"
"It's interesting. Yes, absolutely gets my attention."
"Yeah, just that whole idea of thinking about what else is going on with people. And why it's important to do something about their COPD for other reasons, separate. Look, patients with COPD, the vast majority of them in the 95 to 99% range have a history of cigarette smoking, at least in this country."
And those same patients have increased risk of those cardiovascular events.
"Independent of COPD. So that both happen to the same patients is not surprising. But seeing it this way, yes."
"(Silence). Okay. Well, that sort of answers some of my questions from the previous slide about baseline. Some point to some extent. The upper left hand corner image here. I mean, the message here is, ""COPD plus anything else puts people at increased risk of more trouble, feeling worse than dying."" Okay. Now, to break it down, upper left. ""Patients with COPD are twice as likely as patient without COPD of having cardiovascular disease."" Not a huge surprise and you're smoking, many of them are smokers. So that, that's the case shouldn't be a surprise. That having multiple significant diseases causes more shortness of breath, worse quality of life and greater risk of hospitalization. Well, you've got two classes of diseases, COPD and cardiovascular events. Either of which alone results in shortness of breath, quality of life decline and risk of hospitalization. Put them together of course, it's going to be more likely. So that's sort of a no kidding."
"Okay. But the risk of mortality, those numbers are really impressive. I guess it shouldn't be surprising. And there's a big range, especially in COPD and ischemia and COPD and heart failure. Huge range."
"Might want to see why there's such a big range in there. Maybe it conceivably relates to the severity of COPD. Why the severity of this, the ischemic heart disease. The range of heart failure is a little narrower. But again, the severity of the COPD, the severity of the heart failure. I mean, those are quantifiable. I mean, it's certainly all believable, but it might benefit from a little more explanation."
"And another one, which brings to my... Well, it depends on what order you're presenting these in."
Okay. I was at psychology nursing in college and we get all   00:47:53 .
"So anyway, what was the question? Oh yeah, saying-"
"Motivating to think differently, about a five."
"Well. Okay. Left side. Yeah, not a surprise. Patients with COPD also have heart disease. Right side at first pass. I said, ""What?"" Moderate COPD more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than patients with severe COPD. But that was the first pass. Second pass, ""Oh yeah, the ones with more severe COPD are more likely to die from COPD."" So that makes sense."
"Yeah, yeah. Prevent the COPD from getting worse. So patients can die from something else."
"Yeah. Well, you might delay that by giving them a shot at surviving one disease. I mean look, we're mortal. The mortality rate for being a human is a 100%."
"Right. So if you can delay it from one cause, you might live long enough to get it from something else. You go back 150 years, people died in their 30s, 40s and 50s from infections. And not so many died from heart disease and cancer. Because they just didn't get that far."
"Okay. You're throwing some longevity, you die from other things."
"I'm treating COPD, this isn't going to change that."
"If somebody's got heart disease or cerebrovascular disease. If they're not already doing it, we're going to get them to a cardiologist or a neurologist or a vascular somebody."
"(Silence). Okay. And this is the interaction of the various pathophysiologic states. COPD causing trouble with cardiovascular risk in particular. And that's, if somebody is hypoxic is not going to make your lungs worse. But the hypoxia you get from COPD is going to make the cardiovascular disease acutely worse. And that makes perfect sense."
"Well, when I'm treating COPD, I'm treating the COPD. And I don't really think about the benefits of doing that for their other problems. But if somebody's got heart disease or cerebrovascular disease and they're having a problem with it. Yeah, treat the COPD just to mitigate that contribution to their cardiovascular problems."
"I don't know that I'm going to do anything differently, but I'm really going to think about it differently. I would certainly think about it differently."
"It's pretty clear, does not take long to sort it out."
"Okay. Well the first point, no kidding, this is not news. The second point, increased breathlessness is either an exacerbation in it of itself or a manifestation of more severe disease, also not news. And the last point, this is where we're headed in the big picture I guess. Certainly newer than the other two, but not news. Patients with COPD is something that needs attention. And I think there's been more and more support for that in the last several years."
"Well, I mean it's all interesting. I like the graphic on the right. Seeing this sort of acceleration."
"Not surprising, but sort of like, ""Oh yeah, that makes sense. I know that."" Seeing it that way is interesting."
"Nothing surprising here, patients who were having more trouble are having more trouble."
"Okay. Well, the impact of eosinophilia is striking. The impact of treating those patients with inhaled corticosteroid is also striking. This makes a strong case for treating patients with COPD with eosinophilia with inhaled corticosteroids. It might be interesting to see any similar presentation of the impact of inhaled corticosteroids on patients with COPD without eosinophilia."
This is making the case for treating more aggressively earlier. And I think that-
"I'm okay with just using triple therapy or ICS triple therapy. Well, just treating more aggressively earlier generally. The right side says ""Delaying maintenance therapy."" That needs to be clarified a little bit because if you're using any of the three ICS, LABA or LAMA. Would be considered maintenance therapy, even if used as a single entity. So the right side, delaying maintenance therapy. Well see, these patients are all on maintenance therapy with one, two or three drugs. If what you're trying to tell us is you should be using two or three drugs or double or a triple inhaler sooner. The right side doesn't really make that clear."
"If the point is delaying step up in maintenance therapy, might make it a little clearer."
"Well, I think this is a good general approach. It doesn't get into a lot of details but that's okay. This is a more broad based recommendation."
"The data, the little blurb about pulmonary rehab."
"Exacerbations are bad, we get more exacerbations than hospitalization and deaths. Earlier aggressive treatment can mitigate that. And eosinophilia is an indicator, possibly a need for more aggressive treatment."
"(Silence). All right. Well, this is complicated and not all that clear."
"Okay. All right. Well, the overall impression from the aggregate of that. Is that product X, which is triple therapy, is a lot better than LABA/LAMA. A little bit, but significantly better than ICS/LABA. And that adding the triple therapy is better for patients with eosinophilia than LABA/LAMA."
"ICS clearly is important for those patients. That seems to be important for a lot of patients. I mean, addition of ICS seems to be really important. Because the ICS/LABA patients appear to do better than the LABA/LAMA patients, by these polar emerges."
I'm trying to remember it. It had an impact even on patients who have not had an exacerbation. In terms of reducing the risk of an exacerbation.
"So there's a little bit of a case being made there for, ""Well, just do this."" I don't remember if those patients were broken down into phenotypes. I don't think they were."
"Okay. Well, certainly patients who have failed ICS/LABA, I'm sorry, LABA/LAMA."
"With an exacerbation or without improvement in symptoms or with decline of function. And patients with eosinophilia, certainly those who are not already on an ICS in their regimen. And patients with eosinophilia periods."
"Well, we set up the problem and we solved it. I think it does that pretty well."
"And again, you mentioned earlier, you're not going to see all of these things. You'll be seeing one or some of them."
"But the impact of exacerbation is clear, the importance of prevention about exacerbation is clear. And the benefit of treating with a regimen that includes ICS, especially for patients with eosinophilia, is clear."
And stepping up treatment earlier sooner than later. The benefits of step up therapy sooner than later was made pretty clear now. But that depends on having seen that particular slide.
"Okay. Yeah, in this group of four D stays, the rest go."
"The rest can go. I mean, there could be some alternatives. I think of those four, G is the best. There's some redundancy."
Yeah. I think if we're trying to keep this concise.
"No, I think that's a good order. The first one is-"
"What is that? O, exacerbations begin exacerbations. Exacerbations cause other trouble. You might switch G and L."
And then the risk factors for exacerbation being breathlessness and eosinophilia. And then what are we going to do about it?
"I'm pulmonary medicine, as well as board certified in critical care medicine. It's a four-person pulmonary group in suburban Western United States, associated with the community hospital."
"Probably about, well, pre-COVID 65% office-based, 35% hospital. That shifts as the COVID numbers go up and down."
"Well, they generally are referred by other usually primary care specialties. Some are hospital referrals after an exacerbation. I don't know. I tell you, I see about 55 COPDers a month."
"Fairly evenly distributed mild, moderate, and severe. "
I don't know what else to say there. It's sort of bread and butter.
"Sure. I mean, pretty standard. My first choice is a LAMA with LAMA/LABA following it, if that's either unsuccessful or if they start off using a lot of SABAs on initial presentation. Then if I'm not using... I'm using less and less ICS LABAs than I was in the past, but I still say maybe 10 or 15% of the patients are on ICS LABA."
"Then on to a triple if that's not successful, or they're having exacerbations, or at risk."
I'd say probably about 40% at this point are on combination therapies.
"Well, let me... It's 40% are on triple. The issue is we have a lot of military retirees, and unfortunately you have to use-"
"Yeah. You have to use open triples in that population. There are people, if their insurance allowed, I would actually prefer to use closed triples. So, I'd say I'm probably using... So of that 40%, it's probably say 40% Trelegy, 30% Breztri, and then 30% open triples, mostly just because of insurance issues."
"Yeah. Mostly it's co-pay insurance coverage sort of issues. I mean, I don't think they can really tell me much new about these products that I haven't... you've either experienced personally or read in the appropriate journals."
"No, not really. I haven't seen any real safety signals at all of concern. Some people will complain they don't like the taste or maybe it gives them some throat irritation, but they're quite minor issues that usually can be solved by switching to an alternative form, and they seem quite successful at controlling symptoms."
COPD is a major healthcare... Yep. Got it.
"No, I don't think anything in this would be any at all shocking to someone who's treating these patients on a frequent basis."
"Yeah, maybe. I might not have guessed 384 million, but I mean, I kind of know. I'm sure it's a soft number worldwide, but-"
"I guess depending on your definition of severe exacerbations, it seems perhaps a little high, but again, I'm not sure what... I'd have to click on number six footnote and really see what they were defining as a severe exacerbation. Certainly it's a definite risk factor for progressive disease and the need for intervention."
"Is that still true with COVID out there? I wonder, but yeah."
"I mean, it makes sense. Listen, I mean, it's what I spend half my day treating, so it's not too shocking. Yeah."
"Relevance, credibility and motivation. Okay. Got it."
"Don't let me quibble about the numbers. Well, I mean, I start the day motivated, so it's not making me more motivated. I'd say five."
"Yeah, but I'm starting motivated. So, yeah. Yeah."
"I mean, yeah. If you're presenting it to pulmonologists, they're going to be sort of like seeing this, you don't... This isn't really news to me. I mean, I realize all these brochures have a front section, so to speak, but this slide-"
"Well, I didn't know Canada was doing so well compared to us."
Interesting. The Canadians stopped smoking. Is that-
"It's hard to read that little... Oh, that's England. That's interesting here."
"You can see where those are probably coal mining areas in England, aren't they?"
"Yeah. I mean, I've given these lectures, and these are sort of the introduction before you get to the meat of the discussion. Again, nothing really new for people who are pulmonologists are dealing with this regularly."
"Since I treat COPDers on a individual basis, it doesn't really help me to know which county has a higher incidence than the other because I'm seeing them as they come in."
"I mean, they're fine. I don't know if I... I wouldn't want a rep spending a lot of time on this kind of thing because it would be just sort of... I mean, it's just information I know already, and it's like, ""Do you have a new product? Let's get to the meat of the discussion."""
"So, I probably wouldn't have a lot of patience for this, to be honest."
"No, I mean, it's like I say, I've given these lectures, and it would probably be a second slide just to warm up the audience, but it's fine."
"Yeah. I mean, it's interesting because I don't know about Sporanox. I think I've looked at UPLIFT and  inaudible 00:18:07 . Most of the entry criteria for these trials require that you have exacerbations within... To have a trial, most of them require two exacerbations to be even enrolled in the study. So, I'm not sure if that number is really all comers. I mean, certainly severe COPDers who have had an exacerbation are at increased risk of having more exacerbations, which is interesting, I guess."
"How would you describe it? It's sort of like they're going down the bowl, but there's a bit... The downward spiral, I'm sure that's a nicer way of saying it, of yes, of the COPDers who are inadequately treated. I try to get them all into rehabilitation if they're anywhere more than just moderate disease for just this reason. Yeah. So, it's a good plug for pulmonary rehabilitation programs."
"Yeah. Again, you'd have to... I guess you'd have to look at the footnote and really see how severe these exacerbations are to... Yeah. I mean, patients do minimize tremendously. They, I mean, frequently come in on... When they come in undiagnosed, they'll tell you, ""The history is I had pneumonia three times last year and three times the year before."" It's like, ""No, you didn't have pneumonia. You had a COPD exacerbation that they treated with antibiotics, when they should have been treating it with the bronchodilators and steroids. But yeah."" Yeah. There's a definite tendency of patients to feel that their acute bronchitis episodes are really not exacerbations, but really are some sort of pneumonia. They love pneumonia."
It's to get you anti... and then the Z-Pak. It's like they've taken a million Z-Paks.
"Well, it's definitely true that the exacerbations do start this downward spiral. It's a very bad sign for patients to start it down that road, so preventing them is crucial. I mean, the reps don't have to sell me on that one. I've known that all along."
It's kind of cute. It's a cute downward spiral. Yeah.
"Well, there's a lot of lead up before you get to selling a product. It's-"
"Yeah. The reps aren't going to get that far. Yeah. There's definitely a stepwise decline in pulmonary function when... I have never seen that graph on the right. That's quite interesting, actually. Of course, the severe patients don't have that far to go. I mean, if they lost 87 milliliters, they might not be alive anymore, and it's interesting that I'd really... That's one thing, I'd definitely want to look at the study and see how they came up with those numbers, but that is interesting that the excess lung function decline."
"On the varying severities, that's quite interesting. Yeah."
"Not confusing. I wouldn't accept it sort of on face value. I'd have to fact check that one. So, I'd definitely... It would probably motivate me to pull the paper and see what, in fact, what's going on."
"Well, I mean, I'd want to click on to the actual paper that's being referenced here and take a look at that one. So, I mean, that would be me-"
"Well, that patients don't fully recover even after their exacerbation is completed. There's not complete return to normal function or even prior function. Yeah, which is exactly the reason why you want to prevent these in the first place."
"Yeah, no. I understand that. Yeah. When I say I want to see the paper, that's-"
... for the sake of argument. I'm assuming what you're telling me is true that... Right.
"Yeah. Exacerbations, they're terrible. Definitely avoid them at all cost."
"Yeah, no. It resonates. Yeah. I mean, I'm motivated to prevent these patients from having exacerbations."
"No, I think it's clear. I mean, I like the three graphs of the zero, one to two, and greater than three, and showing the, what do they call it? Kaplan-Meier curve, the survival data. I think that's well presented."
"Well, assuming that I wasn't already motivated before, I'd be like, ""Yeah, we really got to stop these patients from exacerbating."""
"I mean, there's no question. It's a very negative event in the life of a COPDer to have at least a moderate to severe exacerbation. Whether the mild exacerbations really have this impact, I think it's debatable, but yeah. And you're saying moderate exacerbations, right?"
"I mean, I saw a exacerbation today, and it was mild. We're treating with a short course of steroids and an antibiotic. I wouldn't expect that to have any real long-term consequences. It might produce a change in medicine regimen, though they were actually already on a triple."
"But if they hadn't been on a triple, it would've been an indication to think about starting a triple in that case."
I'm not sure what the graphics on the right are trying to tell me. It's like a caution sign. Yeah.
"A little confusing what they're... I'm not sure. It doesn't add much. I think it just perhaps confuses the issue, to be honest."
But a caution sort of implies there's something you could do.
"It's not clear that you can, once it's happened, that that's really preventable. I mean, should we be anticoagulating? Yeah. I mean, but that's not the topic of this discussion, but it does. Yeah. I'm not sure the graphics add to that."
"Yeah. I mean, the incident ratios are not like it's going from 1.4 to 1.7. So, it's a little bit of lying... not lying with numbers. In fact, and the MI risk from the graph, it looks like you're quintupling your risk of MI. I'm not actually sure how they get two times. You're going from a 0.55 to a 2.27. I'm not sure how that's... That seems like far more than doubling, but-"
"And what's the baseline, actually? This is non-COPDer? Yeah. So, these numbers, I mean, there's nothing surprising. It's certainly true that these patients have... but you could quibble about the numbers, but I think the shelf of it is fine."
"Well, it's almost a truism that if you have COPD plus something else, you're sicker than if you have COPD and nothing else. I mean, it's almost-"
"Yeah. It's just, it's sort of obvious. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Having COPD and cancer is worse than having just COPD. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure what this is really saying. It's sort of stating the obvious."
"First of all, the COPD plus ischemic heart disease, the range is so broad it's to be almost meaningless. "
"The diabetes, it's also kind of a... Yeah, and heart failure also very broad range. Yeah. So, I think their the numbers are so broad that it's hard to say you're surprised by any of the numbers, and again, these are risk ratios rather than absolute numbers."
"Yeah. Cardiovascular-related deaths. Okay, and lung cancers. You smoke, you get a lot of bad things happen to you. Yeah. Smoking's bad. I spend all day saying that."
"I mean, it's not new information. No, this is not something I would be like, ""Let me see the data. Let me spend more time looking at this."" I'd be like, ""Yeah. Makes sense."""
I'm not sure what it's... Is it every COPDer should have a cardiologist evaluate them? I'm not sure what it's really trying to tell me.
"Scale of one to... Yeah. I mean, I do treat their cardiovascular disease too, so I guess six."
It's hard to tell. Is that a smoke stack next to the cigarettes? It's hard to tell what that's supposed to be.
Is that like a dirty factory? I can't tell.
"A graphic is supposed to clarify, not obfuscate. "
"Yeah. I mean, it's smoking causes COPD and it also causes atherosclerosis. Yeah. Yeah."
"Well, the issue, I think is it's saying it's driven by exacerbation. That's interesting. I'd have to look into one. That's being thrown into the mix. I mean, I suppose, and clearly... and MI will make their COPD worse too. So, they're all interlinked. That's kind of an interesting way to think, a new way to think about it. I wouldn't have expressed it that way, so okay. I kind of like that one, but maybe it's not all that clear. I guess maybe I got focused too much on the little icon. It's really not sort of... I mean, it's a hypothesis. There's no real way to know for sure what's causing these increased cardiovascular events. I mean, it's a reasonable hypothesis, but-"
"Well, I fix your graphics, maybe. Make them a little clearer. "
"Yeah. It says potentially driven. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure. It just wasn't clear at first what it was getting at, and I guess I'd have to... because I was spending more time in the graphics and less on the text. This is a very text-driven argument that the exacerbations are potentially putting strain on people's cardiovascular system. So, maybe the headline. And it's not really the shared risk factors, you're saying, in truth. What it's really saying is that the stress of an exacerbation is potentially the cause of these cardiovascular events of stroke and heart attack. So, I might change the headline to make it clear what you're... I mean, it might be a debatable point, but if you're going to make it, you should make it clearly. You know?"
"Well, it's a hypothesis. It's not really proven."
"I think six is even high considering there's no real data showing that what's happening. It's a reasonable hypothesis, so I think I'm being generous with a six in this one, but it is an interesting idea."
"I don't know if it's wrong, but I'm not sure it's really supported by much data."
"Yeah. So, the first one is certainly true. I mean, the past history, and that's what we talked about in the initial slide when you mentioned studies that required prior exacerbations, and then say these patients are at risk for future exacerbations. Yeah. So, that's definitely true. Increased breathlessness? I'd have to look at that one. I'm not sure what they really mean by that. Is that when they come in breathless, that they're risking... I mean, it's certainly the side... and increased breathlessness is actually a symptom of an exacerbation. So, I'm not sure that it's... I'm not sure."
"Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Those patients, if they're showing eosinophilia, they probably have a asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, and they certainly are higher risk for exacerbations, so that's true. Raised eosinophil counts in these patients are not that common because we've been looking at them, looking for it."
"Yeah. The headline is certainly important. In the first, certainly, and I think I mentioned earlier, you asked one about my paradigm for treating these patients. Certainly if they've had exacerbations, I'm much faster to go to a triple than if they hadn't. So, I think it's fair to say this is... Yeah. It's important."
"No, it's a squishy topic. It's hard to predict the future in these patients."
"There's some quibbling, but mostly it's pretty good. "
"Well, I mean, instead of making you think, look at every patient saying, ""What is their risk of exacerbation, and maybe they had prior exacerbations that they're not telling you about."" So, spend more time examining that."
"I don't understand what the Y axis is on the left graph. Patients with COPD percent. Is that percent of  inaudible 00:45:33 ? No. What does that even mean? Frequency? Is that exacerbation frequency? That's not really what it's... I'm a little puzzled as to what the Y axis is trying to... I mean, clearly if you've never had an exacerbation, you're not nearly as likely to have an exacerbation as if you have."
"And then at none, or one, or more. I'm totally confused on what that graph is saying."
"So, the Y axis would be frequency, but then what is none, one, or two? What is the blue and the white supposed to be saying? I have no idea."
"The right one is once you've had an exacerbation, you're more likely to have them in the future, and it'll occur more frequently. But I would have to really spend a lot of time puzzling out that left graph to figure what they're trying to say."
"Well, just to get back to that, it's like a three dimensional graph because clearly in the X axis you have two different things going on in the blue and the white. Yeah. So, it's a three dimensional graph they're trying to do in two dimensions, and the one on the right... Yeah. I mean, it's just median time 5.4 years from the first exacerbation to the second. That seems quite long. In truth, COPD it's sort of, they get any respiratory infection will be generally manifested as a exacerbation. Well, actually, COVID was interesting because there were fewer exacerbations because there were fewer grandchildren to give these patients viral respiratory infections. But I mean one a year is almost predictable. I mean, it's hard to imagine that they're really going five years between exacerbations."
"Well, I don't understand half of it, so I'm going to have to... Yeah. I mean, four, and that's that's being generous. I'm not sure."
"Five. Exacerbations are bad, but we got that."
"An MRC score is just the severity of your COPD, so that's not adding anything to this whole thing. Then what is this none, or one, or more telling me? Again, I don't get that."
Is that no exacerbations that they're saying in MRC1? Is that saying 35%-
"Oh, so that's really confusing. Yeah. Yeah."
"Yeah. That is a very bizarre way to present data. I mean, you're saying how many patients. It should be frequency of exacerbation as the Y axis, and then you just march up with one or more exacerbations. The none is weird."
"It's a weird way to present the data. Yeah. I mean, now I think I get what they're saying, but I shouldn't have to be parsing this."
"No, the severe patients are... Yeah. If they're severe, they have a lot more risk of exacerbations than the not severe."
"Getting rid of those weird little white boxes, I'd say six."
"Well, it's just reminding that your severe patients are at higher risk of exacerbation, and maybe some intervention should be undertaken to try to change that."
"Okay. This is in control. Well, as I look at this study, this is really an ACOS group of patients with their elevated eosinophil counts. Yeah. I mean, it's okay. It's interesting."
"Yeah, but I mean, I screen all my new COPDers with IG levels and eosinophil counts at the same time as I'm doing their Alpha-1 antitrypsin testing. So, it's something I certainly am looking for as to whether they have reactive airway disease that may be an asthmatic type. It's not surprising that these patients are at increased exacerbation risk."
"The data on the ICS use is interesting. I'd want to look at that one more closely, so that would pique my interest."
"Yeah. I don't see a lot of high eosinophil counts in these patients. I'd have to say sort of like a five. I mean, for those who have them, it's relevant, but it's not a general issue."
"I'd have to really look at this paper to see if... What kind of ICS treatment? I'd say five. I'd need to look further into it, but it is interesting."
"I'd say a five. I mean, if they do have eosinophilia, then they should be on an inhaled corticosteroid, but that's kind of obvious because if they have eosinophilia, they're probably asthmatic."
"Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you're using an exacerbation rate, which is what you should have been using on the other curves."
"Well, the study would have to be done. Basically, it's implying that even mild to moderate COPDers who have not had an exacerbation should be treated with triple therapy preemptively. I don't know if there's any real literature to suggest that one, but it's certainly not part of any of the association guidelines to imply that you should be starting... I mean, they all use a step approach to these patients. None of them are... and certainly, I don't think triple therapy really has been shown to be successful in mild patients. So, I think it's at least a very controversial point. Certainly delaying maintenance therapy. I'm not sure what they mean by that. I mean, not giving any maintenance therapy? Because LAMA/LABA therapy does reduce exacerbations as well, so really the question is, would LAMA/LABA versus triple therapy in a mild population show... Would triple therapy really have an advantage? Yeah. It's interesting. Requires further conversation before I'd accept that one wholeheartedly."
"Relevance. I don't know if it's even true, so I guess I'd have to say a four."
"A seven. It's interesting, an interesting idea. But I think you'd need a study. I mean, I wouldn't just do this sort of willy-nilly. I'd want there to be some real literature on this one before embarking on this route."
Very bread and butter slide. Yeah. Nothing controversial there.
"It's certainly getting people into rehab is crucial. It's not something that primary care physicians really think about very often, so I think it'd be... and maybe even, I don't even know if all the pulmonologists are on board with rehabilitation, to be honest."
"Exacerbation is really bad, and you try to prevent them if you can."
"I mean, on the scale from one to seven, compelling?"
"Yeah. I mean, well, I would never sit through this whole thing, so I have to pick a three. I mean, this is stuff I know and would it be more compelling for someone in primary care? Maybe? I don't know."
"There's not enough information and new information in it to be that compelling. I mean, there's some food for thought in some of it, but-"
"Well, the whole question has been how early to start triple therapy in these patients. I mean, is this really something that should be reserved for moderate-to-severe disease or would patients with less severe disease actually benefit from it? Or it might be toxic in them, and maybe a mistake to start too early. So, that would be the issue."
"All the triple studies have recruited patients with moderate-to-severe disease and prior histories of exacerbation. So, to try to... What's the word? I'm searching for the word, to use this data for patients who are not in those subgroups may not be appropriate. I guess that's the easiest way to say it."
"Okay. Oh, that's a high number needed to treat, 80. That's a lot of patients."
"I'm not sure I understand what on treatment post-treatment in this slide means. Is that when they were actually getting Product X, or in the study and after? I'd have to look into that one to see what that's supposed to be implying."
"Yeah. It's interesting. It gives better results for the ICS LABA than has been traditional, but okay. You can move on. Interesting."
"Yeah. How many patients they actually have in that subgroup with elevated eosinophil counts, I'd want to know, but that's a group of patients they're trying to treat with biologics, actually, or recruit for these biologic studies. It's very hard to find these patients because we've been looking, but okay."
"Yeah. Yeah. Certainly in the moderate-to-severe population with the history of exacerbations and perhaps even if they're moderate to severe without a history of exacerbations, they'd have both improvement in survival, all-cause mortality, and decreased exacerbation risk if they're treated with triple versus dual therapy."
"Yeah. I mean, seven. It's actually showing mortality data that's compelling, which for instance, Trelegy really couldn't show in their studies. Breztri has tried to show. Sort of the holy grail of all this is to improve the survival of COPD. So, if you can do that, that would be terrific."
"Well, I mean, I'd look carefully at the study entry criteria and say, ""That group of patients should be on triple therapy because clearly in that group of patients, it's superior to dual therapy."" Presuming they're moderate-to-severe COPDers with two exacerbations in the last year. I mean, I'd have to really drill down in to say how mild disease they were actually recruiting for these trials."
"Very well. I mean, I think people, I don't know if they treat exacerbation seriously enough, I guess. So, it would avoid that issue, that tendency to minimize the importance of exacerbations."
"I can't see the letters very well because it's... but I would say I would definitely keep two. We have zero, one, two, three, four, five."
"Will move around. So, I can't see. Is that a G? Or A, B, D, F, C?"
And then I liked J because it was an interesting idea.
"I think that's J, right? Yeah, J. I thought J, maybe was it-"
"Okay, maybe not. Yeah. I thought K was fine. Yeah. I'd keep K."
"It depends how many slides you consider concise because you showed me, what? Like 25 of them."
"Well, and then the five Product X ones, so okay."
"Right. So, yeah. I would definitely do U and V. I'm not sure I understand W."
"So, I wouldn't do W because I don't really understand W."
"N's interesting. I'd have to really look at, I mean, how many patients they really had with elevated blood eosinophil levels. It's just such a rare-"
"... situation to find. I mean, we search for them and we just don't find... I guess part of the problem is those patients usually are asthmatics who smoke, and so they don't qualify for these COPD trials. I'd really have to at-"
"... how because you want to send them over for a clinical trial, but they carry a diagnosis of asthma. So, they're not eligible kind of thing, even though they have COPD now."
"O. O I think is... I don't know if your data supports O, to be honest. So, I wouldn't put that in there and P is bread and butter pulmonology. I mean, if you were promoting pulmonary rehabilitation, it'd be a great slide to have."
"Definitely Y, though actually, it's interesting. Y is an interesting study because it actually says the ICS LABA is as good as the Product X, which may not be selling your drug very well, but certainly for... See, I wonder. Well, you'd have to say how many of these are really asthmatics who really do need the inhaled corticosteroids, which is what Z is actually saying as well. Definitely Y, though I'm not sure Z. I don't know if I'd keep Z."
"Yeah. I think I'd put K first and move that to number one with identification. Yeah, and then you could say... Okay. Then exacerbations increase lung function, death, maybe the cardiovascular, you throw in the eosinophils. That's interesting. Okay. Then we're on to Product X, and let's go down and say... We're just going to... Well, I think I'd put Y before V. Just those are primary versus secondary endpoints, and then I think you have a good story for your product there."
"Well, I think that COPD exacerbations are common and have long-term lasting consequences on people's lung health and survival. An agent that can prevent those exacerbations will also likely prevent mortality, and in appropriate patient population, Product X will be superior to a LAMA/LABA or a ICS LABA."
"Sure. I'm board certified in family practice. I've been practicing for 16 years. I practice in rural West Virginia. The majority, probably 85% of my patients are either Medicare or Medicaid, mostly in adults, elderly population. That's probably about all you need to know."
"Well, typically anybody who has any kind of breathing problems will come see their family doctor first which would be me. So I would see them, diagnose them, usually start them on the first line agents. And then in my practice have a lot of smokers and coal miners. "
"So that's mostly where my COPD comes from. So usually by the time they see me, their symptoms are nothing new, but they're getting worse. So on a typical day I'll have a coal miner who comes and sees me. Typically they smoke as well and they'll come see me. They're probably in their, I'd say maybe mid-forties and are like. ""Oh, I've been short breath for a good 10 years but it's really now starting to become problematic for me and it limits what I can do,"" and things like that. "
"So that's when they come see me. Usually typically I'll start on a short acting beta agonist, something like Albuterol rescue inhaler or something like that. And that'll work for a while, but they continue to smoke and then symptoms continue to get worse throughout their life. And then we'll go to other agents and typically we'll progress to a long-acting anticholinergic and then eventually get to inhale corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists. It just progresses through a typical timeframe."
"Oh, geez. I'd probably say 60, 65 maybe. I have a lot of chronic ones."
"Usually it's based on their symptoms. When I initiate one treatment... I initiate the first treatment it'll help their symptoms for a while. Then their symptoms are overcome that treatment. I'll add another one, same thing. It'll help their symptoms for a while. Then their symptoms will overcome that. And then that's when we usually get to about triple therapy."
"As I mentioned before I'm mostly Medicare, Medicaid so I am dictated what I can prescribe by whatever's on the Medicaid formulary. So when we get to triple therapy typically what happens is usually I'll have them start Spiriva first. And then once that's ineffective then we add Advair and that would be their triple therapy right there."
Because those are the medicines that are covered by Medicaid.
"Well, I'll be honest because of COVID I haven't seen any drug reps for about a year."
I don't know that I have any questions. I mean the medicine's in the triple combination therapies are the same medicines use independently. It's nothing strikingly new.
I think it's just underscoring the how prevalent and how devastating COPD truly is in the population. This is a global population.
I definitely agree that estimated over half of the patients with COPD are undiagnosed because I see in my practice that's a lot because they won't come to me until the symptoms get very severe or severe enough to affect their lifestyle. So I could definitely agree with that.
No. I think these are all very good and important points.
One that's most critical to me is COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide and it's right in the middle there. So I think that's perfect.
"I'm going to say three because the slide's impressive, but to make me think differently. No, because this is already presenting information I already know. So it's not going to make me think differently."
"No, I mean I think... Don't misunderstand me. I think it's great, but it just doesn't change my thinking because I already know this."
"First I like the slide. I like it. I like the information it's presenting, but it looks like it's concentrating. I think that's England. If it's presented to me I'd like it to be America obviously."
But besides that I like the information it would present if it was America.
I think U.S. compared to other countries in general.
U.S. compared to worldwide.  inaudible 00:16:20 .
"I mean I guess it's important, but that's not something that surprises me. I mean socioeconomically people who smoke are... To be perfectly blunt, poor people are the people who smoke these days."
"Okay. Up there where it says exposure to environmental risk factors for COPD. I'm not quite sure what biomass fuel encompasses, but particularly in my region coal mining. Whatever that would fall under would be an important tab."
"Again, I'm going to go with about a three for the same reasons as before."
Okay. Okay. So the main takeaway is patients have frequent exacerbations. Many times they don't report it and it just results in the downward spiral of their overall health.
"It resonates, but it's not surprising. Again, this is information that's pretty common to me."
"No, I will say I like the little spiral diagram. That's nice."
It's visually appealing and it really resonates and depicts a decline of the overall health of the patient. 
"Well, as with any COPD, the exacerbations result in a downward stair step with their lung function."
"Again, just to clarify the information is not new to me. "
"It's a good visual presentation of it and I liked it, but it's not surprising or new."
Similar concept is exacerbations and this time it's exacerbations or increased hospitalization in death instead of just decline of overall function like the previous slide was.
"I mean again, I hate to be repetitive but it resonates."
"No, I think it's depicted fairly well. I like it. "
"Okay. So, yeah it is. But in the grand scheme of things, and again I'm speaking from my experience only."
My patients with COPD have a multitude of other problems.
"And frankly, they're more likely to die of one of the other problems than they are of COPD."
I'd still say it's a six. It is relevant.
Okay. Okay. This is interesting. I like this. 
So this is correlating how an exacerbation of COPD can increase cardiovascular events.
I like the two boxes here. CV events increased the first 10 days following a moderate exacerbation and the risk of CV events persists for up to a year after an exacerbation.
So there's some points that kind of stick out.
"It is. But again, like I said before this data just kind of presents it like this patients or these patients have COPD only. Every one of my patients with COPD had got diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and a multitude of other things. So the risk is off the charts anyway."
I'm going to go a six on this one because it does present some newer information or information I hadn't really thought of.
Okay. Okay. It's just talking about the comorbidities and how much their risk increases when they have comorbidities along with the COPD.
"No, it's very clear. If I could be perfectly candid, and I think that's why you're you do these things is to get my impression."
"So I look at this and I'm like yeah, so what. I already know this. What is different about this? Why are you presenting this information to me? What are you going to do about it?"
I mean that's pretty much 90% of my population right there.
I'm going to give it a seven. It's pretty relevant.
Patients with moderate COPD are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than patients with severe COPD.
"Well, I guess the main idea is that cardiovascular disease is the cause of death of people with COPD more often. You would think COPD would be the cause of death, but according to this it's cardiovascular disease."
"This statement right here, it confuses me. It says across five studies up to 39% of COPD deaths were due to CV causes. How were they COPD deaths if they were due to CV causes?"
"If they were CV causes, they wouldn't be COPD deaths I wouldn't think."
"Yeah. I think what they're trying to say is 39% of COPD patients, they're deaths were due to CV causes. But the way they phrase that it's just misleading."
I'm going to give it a six. That was interesting about moderate versus severe COPD.
Okay. So this is showing how COPD can increase the problems that lead to cardiovascular death.
"It's not really resonating. I mean this is pretty standard. Obviously, if they can't breathe it's going to increase the load on their heart."
"So obviously people who are at risk of exacerbations are going to have worse outcomes. So they're trying to help you identify patients that are more at risk. And if I would say something just before we start talking about it, my initial thoughts are yeah, this is great, but when you have 15 minutes to talk to a patient about 10 different problems this is not going to be high on my list."
I mean all of my patients are at risk of exacerbations so I don't know. And in an ideal world I would have all the time in the world to talk to them and identify the ones at risk of exacerbations but it just doesn't happen.
"Okay. Again, this is kind of stating the obvious. I mean obviously you're at greater risk of future exacerbations the more you have in the past. That one slide on the right hand side is every COPD patient I've ever had. Their frequency of exacerbations increases as their disease worsens."
"I don't think it's all that important. And I say that because obviously I don't want them to have any exacerbations and we do everything I can to prevent them from having exacerbations, but it happens. I mean I have yet to have a COPD patient that got better permanently."
I mean the disease is only going to get worse. All you're doing is slowing the progress of the disease. And no matter what I do it's always going to progress. 
I'm just trying to treat this so that something else is their demise and not COPD. That's my only goal. 
"So, this is clearly obvious in the grand scheme of treating the patients. I don't know. It's just kind of a no brainer."
"It's kind of kind stating the obvious. Increased breathlessness are going to have a higher risk of exacerbations. Well, yeah. "
"Yeah. Well, from my experience I don't think I could think of one patient who didn't have an exacerbation in the timeframe of a year, which is probably more than one."
Okay. So this is talking about eosinophil levels and treatment with corticosteroids. So it's just trying to show how the treatment of corticosteroids decreases the eosinophil levels and thus decreases the exacerbations.
"It's not surprising, but I think... Well, I appreciate the point they're trying to give out. You also have again, everything in medicine is a risk benefit. So if just looking at this you'd be like, ""Well, why don't you have everybody on a corticosteroid?"" Well, because corticosteroids have side effects in and of themselves. It's not something you just want to dole out to every single person who comes in with breathing problems. You don't want to have to put them on a corticosteroid until you have to. Does that make sense?"
"Well, I mean steroids just have their own problems and again here, corticosteroids don't get into rest your body usually, but even in the lungs it diminishes your lung's ability to fight off infections and things like that."
Yeah. Usually it's after the short acting beta agonists have stopped working.
"So obviously I want to try the least offensive medicines first and stick with them until they don't work any longer. The corticosteroids are higher up on my tier of prescribing things. So albuterol is always the first thing I give because it's short acting and it doesn't really have any permanent changes to the lungs. So as long as that works I'm going to keep them on that. Now, when that stops working I'm probably going to go to a short acting or long acting anticholinergic. And then after those two stop working, maybe then I'll start thinking of the corticosteroid."
"Yeah, man. This is similar to what I was just talking about. Okay. So it's basically saying delaying maintenance therapy may increase the risk of progression of the disease in the future."
"I mean, I don't disagree. They are right. But you know, I don't know. I don't think it's motivating at all. This is again, information I'm familiar with."
Okay. Just trying to tell you how to optimize treatment for the patients.
"No, nothing surprising. If I could make one comment it says thorough pheno typing of patients to identify. Yeah, because insurance is going to pay for a phenotype. Like how am I going to know that? That doesn't happen in the real world. At least not yet. I mean maybe as time goes on and genetic sequencing gets easier and cheaper, but right now I'm not going to be able to do that."
"Well, it looks like they're trying to promote earlier intervention with corticosteroids and I'm assuming probably a triple therapy product. And if I could be pretty candid, I mean obviously this is coming from a drug maker company and you're probably trying to promote some triple therapy medicine that's going to be new to the market and trying to show you how it would be better if used earlier."
"My challenge is with COPD or patient compliance in drug formularies. So, no."
"Well, Product X obviously share some improved efficacy compared to the current treatment options. It decreased CV deaths significantly in that one slide. Obviously it must have a corticosteroid in it because it's decreasing eosinophil counts. As with most new medicines yeah sure, it's going to be more efficacious than the current treatment options out there. But again, if I could be candid how expensive is this going to be and are my patient's going to be able to take it?"
"Well, it's compelling in the fact that it works better than the current treatment options we have out there based on the slides that you've shown me. "
"So like I mentioned before, a significant decrease in cardiovascular events. And I think one of the first slides that showed a decrease in exacerbations as well compared to the current treatment options that we're using. So in every slide you show me, it obviously was a good thing for product X."
"Well, the slides you show me, obviously they're marketing this to be used earlier than some of the current methods we have. They're just trying to show you how earlier intervention decreased the progression of the disease with Product X."
"So I think they're trying to market it to all COPD patients. I mean without knowing the exact medicines that are in this product, I'm going to assume that."
What little bit I know right now I'm kind of indifferent. I'd need to know more about it.
"No, definitely not comfortable yet. I would need to see more."
All right. So I'll be honest with you. One of the things that makes me hesitant about this is I don't know the individual medicines in it. My patients are on countless medicines. So is there something in Product X that I'm going to need to know about that's going to counteract the stuff I'm already giving them. 
"I can assume that Product X has the same medicines that these other things do, but I don't know that for sure yet. There may be something new in here that like, ""Oh, I'm going to give them this and I can't give them this medicine anymore because these two are going to interact."""
"That would be my biggest one. No, I can't think of anything else. "
I would get rid of D and keep the other three.
It's just it's stating the obvious. We know this. As physicians we know exacerbations are stair stepped downward.
It just doesn't resonate with me. It's not compelling at all.
I don't know how short you're trying to make this.
I like all of them. I thought they were all compelling. I don't know that I would get rid of any of them.
Okay. Let me read them in order here. Let's see what I think.
"The story would be that obviously COPD affects lots of people in the world. COPD also causes problems in other organs, particularly the heart which is the one you're showing here, And earlier intervention would lessen the progression of the disease. And then you would proceed on the Product X which shows that using it earlier would decrease the mortality and the progression of the disease."
Would you want the slide to include Product?
"Okay. Well, none of the introductory ones make me think differently. Nothing makes me think differently until we start talking about X."
"Because all that information is understood already. Particularly if I'm presenting to physicians they're going to understand that. So any of the last four slides through five, I guess five there. Yeah. Any of the last five slides would make me think differently."
The one that says time to all cause mortality. I can't see that letter. Number 10. Yeah. There you go. That one. That one.
"The whole point is keep the patient alive as long as possible. So again, if you have one slide to present, this is the most resounding to me."
I don't know. I think what they presented here is really good in terms of the Product X slides. They get the high points.
"I mean, just to clarify. Again, I'm assuming that this Product X has similar medications that's a long-acting beta agonist and everything else you're comparing it to in that slide or else they wouldn't be comparing it to them."
"One more. There you go. Yeah, stop there."
"Yeah. That one. That one. Okay. So I'm assuming Product X is going to have similar or the same medicines that you're comparing them to in this graph. They're going to have corticosteroids, long acting beta agonists, muscarinic and all that. But again, if Product X is some new and pivotal medicine I've never seen before, I would make that... If I had advice to give the manufacturer I would make that point immediately. Say hey, this is a... So are they trying to sell me something brand new or are they just rehashing all the old stuff I have in a different administration? Does that make sense?"
So let me give you example just to clarify my point and I'm going to use actual names of medicines because that's what I'm familiar with. Not that I'm saying anything about them. 
"For example like Trilogy. Trilogy, all it is Advair and Spiriva put together. So is Product X going to be the same thing where you just mix two other ones together that I already have available to me and call it something else? Or is it going to be something brand new and innovational that I haven't had the access to before?"
"If it's rehashing all the old products into something new, it would have to be somehow easier to administer like less dosing then I currently have with the other products or else it's the same thing to me. Now if it's a brand new product then yeah."
"Hi, and thank you all so much for waiting. We have the respondent on the line now. Mindy, you may begin."
"Sure. I am a board certified pulmonary critical care physician. I practice with a seven physician group in a community of about 200,000 people. It's a pretty typical community practice. For the vast majority of my career I was split between hospital and office, ran the ICU for over 20 years. Currently I'm primarily office based, see a lot of C O P D, asthma, lung cancer, have participated in clinical research trials."
"Yes. So, as a specialist, I have somewhat of a skewed practice towards the more severe end. I would estimate probably 20% mild, 50% moderate, and 30% severe and very severe. Demographically I'm in the Rust Belt, Great Lakes region of the US. It's primarily an older population. I would estimate probably 60% Medicare, 35% commercial, and 5% others. So it's primarily a working class, older population that I service."
"We follow GOLD guidelines, not precisely, but as a guideline. So for patients who have mild or moderate disease, I tend to use dual therapy, but for patients who progress or patients who present with more severe symptoms, I may even start with triple therapy."
"Frequent exacerbations, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, worsening symptoms, worsening respiratory function, worsening quality of life."
"Thank you. So can you tell me just at a high level, you don't need to go into all the granular detail here, but can you explain the workup of the steps you take when working up a patient with short of breath?"
"History and physical is essential, pulmonary function testing, radiographic studies, either chest x-ray or depending on the circumstances CAT scan, sometimes blood work, sometimes other ancillary tests including cardiac evaluation if I think there's a cardiac cause likely."
"They have historical symptoms that suggest cardiac disease, signs of heart failure, chest pain, things along those lines."
"Usually involve a cardiology referral, address if heart catheterization or other interventions are needed. As a pulmonary physician, I usually do not take the primary responsibility for treating the cardiovascular disease."
"It's a bit murky to be quite honest with you. And it varies on the cardiologist. In general doctors like to say, ""My organ is stable, they're short of breath because of your organ."" So we blame them. They blame us. And I say that partly tongue in cheek, but it is sometimes challenging to determine if a patient is more limited by their cardiac symptoms or their pulmonary symptoms. So it's a shared responsibility and involves communicating between the specialties."
"In our community I primarily manage them as opposed to the primary care doctor. I make assessments about the severity, about influence of comorbidities, and I take primary responsibility for managing their medications. Their pulmonary medicines."
"Cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, then obesity, diabetes, psychiatric illnesses. Those would be the main ones that come to mind."
"Underlying sleep disorders, which are common, we address that as well. The anxiety depressive disorders are often co-managed with the primary care physician."
"Frequently, Because many C O P D patients die of cardiovascular disease rather than their C O P D, but the two are intricately related."
"Well, we only have 45 minutes. It's something-"
So you're familiar with pulmonary function testing and a test called the Forced Vital Capacity?
"So what does vital mean? Vital means life. And so it's been known for decades and decades that the vital capacity correlates directly with overall mortality and morbidity, not just pulmonary. And so there's been again for many, many years research trying to figure out this relationship between cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease, and it's still an area of active research. There are different theories about shared pathophysiology, things like that. I think the truth is even today, again, this has been known for 50 years or longer than that. There still is ongoing research as to what the direct relationship is, but there clearly is a relationship."
"In a large way. So each of us do our best to maximize our organ. And so is, when the patient's short of breath, are their angio medicines maximized? Do they need a stent placed? Do they need more diuretic for their heart failure? Or do they need a different inhaler to see if that will help their shortness of breath? Do they need oxygen? So it's a real challenge to coordinate the care, but it is directly involved too. But there are a number of refined or advanced testing that is done that helps differentiate cardiac from pulmonary limitation, but many are not particularly versed in some of those testing activities. And so there's this back and forth that continues to go on as to which organ is most."
"Yes. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that term or not, but cardiopulmonary exercise testing helps determine most precisely the degree of limitation and guide the precise source of the limitation."
"Oh, I would say at least half. It's an estimate, but, but I would say at least half."
"Yes. We have, I work, I didn't discuss in the introduction, but I have a, my practice is owned by a large multi-city multi-hospital insurance company. And so, we have a shared electronic health record. And so for at least patients that stay within our system, I have the direct access to the cardiovascular notes and the testing done."
"Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, family history."
"I would say moderately. And by that I mean, as medicine is becoming more complex and expanding, it's challenging to keep up with everything in all fields. And so I think the important, the key thing is recognizing your limitation and recognizing what you don't know, because recognizing what you don't know is as important as recognizing what you do know. And that honestly is a significant challenge. But I, hopefully by doing what we're supposed to do, reading notes, reading literature, communicating with each other, hopefully I can keep up with advances in other fields so I can recognize when it's something I can handle and when it's something I can't handle, but it's quite individual."
"So in general, I don't. And by that, I mean, I see their cardiovascular medicines. I review their medicines at each visit for sure, but I am not the one who would change their cardiovascular medicine. If I think that there is a problem more with the heart, then I would communicate directly with the cardiologist or the primary care doctor to say, ""Hey, Mrs. Smith, I think has been more heart failure than C O P D,"" and let them handle it. So honestly   00:16:55  the world, I am not the one making the changes in their cardiovascular medicine."
"It does in a couple of ways. There is some concern, certain cardiovascular medicines may impact the breathing. Historically beta blockers. There is a concern about beta blockers worsening C O P D or asthma. There's pretty good data and there's actually recent study that showed overall  inaudible 00:18:00  of beta blockers in patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease and pulmonary disease is beneficial. But that would  inaudible 00:18:08 ."
"A general example, but is more real world, is the whole concept of polypharmacy. So patients that have heart failure, you can look at literature that says there are five or six drugs they should be on. And then you're asking me, ""Well, who's on triple therapy?"" And so if you have a patient with severe C O P D who has concomitant cardiovascular disease, it's very easy for them to be on seven, eight drugs. And even though there may be a drug that I would like to use that might benefit them, the more drugs you add, the less likely they are to be compliant."
"Some patients with neuropsychiatric issues, some of the smoking cessation drugs, Chantix, Wellbutrin, have neuropsychiatric side effects. So, I'm worried about that. There's a medication, Daliresp, that is used to decrease exacerbations. You probably are familiar with that. It's not a bad drug, but it too sometimes can have, there's a warning about neuropsychiatric issues. So I have to be aware of their other comorbid conditions when I prescribe."
"Minimally. So for example, a long acting beta agonist, very commonly used for C O P D inhalers, again, I know, you know this. The label, which the patients read, talk about cardiovascular complications. And for most patients, the chance of a cardiovascular complication is minuscule, but it's part of the label of the drug. And so, I say small risk of cardiovascular complications from long acting beta agonists. So that would be one example of direct reference."
"That is a fantastic question. I will be honest and tell you, number one, I don't know, number two, my guess would be, and it is an educated guess, that patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease would have a higher risk of exacerbation, but I don't really know that for sure. I'm not sure I've ever been asked that before."
"So I have to interrupt and tell you, I do a lot of these interviews and usually about five or 10 minutes into it I can tell what the purpose of the interview is. And this is fascinating because it's important discussion, but I'm trying to figure out what, where we're headed and what the slides are going to show. So you're holding interest very well."
Not any quicker. It's what's on their   00:22:38  and the degree is severe.
"One kind of important thought about exacerbations are exacerbations beget exacerbations. And so each exacerbation causes further decline in pulmonary function and there's clear evidence that those people that have frequent exacerbations do worse. And so it is a key indicator, whether for cardiovascular disease or C O P D, a patient who is having frequent exacerbations is at risk for dying."
"I have to believe that it does, but on the other hand, if you ask me what drugs that I use for C O P D have been shown to improve mortality, the answer is none except oxygen. So all these drugs, triple inhalers, and it's sort of the holy grail of the pharmaceutical industry is to find a drug that decreases mortality, but none of the drugs that I use other than oxygen decreased mortality."
"Correct. I mean, so again, not sure if it's on the target you're looking at, but decades and decades of research, we know that there's a connection in the heart for example, between the right ventricle and the left ventricle and how they interact and how that interaction is affected in C O P D. We know that patients with severe C O P D have pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. For patients who have concomitant cardiovascular disease, you know that right heart failure and left heart failure together will be additive. So there are many, many potential mechanisms for direct connection between these two."
"Right. But my initial impression is this meets my preconceived notion and I think pretty close to what I was telling you. On the right there, across four studies, 40% of C O P D deaths were due to cardiovascular causes. That's what I, when we talked about the vital capacity, I talked about that. I really did not discuss cancer related death, I guess because in my own mind that sort of goes without saying, because of smoking, but that's clearly seen on some of these studies as well. So I would say this is a very busy slide with tons of information, but it sort of makes the point that, if I had a take home point, the headline is correct that many patients with C O P D die of other things besides C O P D."
"And again, I think, this I think is exactly what I was saying a few minutes ago only these people obviously have more exact percentages than I was able to give you. But I think it basically says the combination of the two is worse than individual diseases."
"And this also goes along with, gosh, what I just that about five minutes ago. Maybe I'm not a total idiot. But I think this is more exact, I think the point that I did mention, but that I knew, is the risk of MI goes up. Stroke I guess I wasn't as aware about. I think one of the points that we didn't talk about, but that at least lung doctors understand is even though C O P D is a lung disease, it really, at least in our world is viewed as a multisystem disease. Besides cardiovascular. Talked about psychiatric issues. There are musculoskeletal issues, there's osteoporosis bone issues. So C O P D really is a multi-system disease. And I think, wherever this is headed, stressing that C O P D is a multisystem disease, this dovetails very nicely into that."
"Well, I knew the cardiovascular deaths were higher, I guess I didn't realize that stroke was that much greater. I think it just goes to the point that a few minutes ago where I was talking about the importance of exacerbations and how they affect raw mortality and being aggressive. I'm old and when we used to treat exacerbations, we would just give patients prednisone three or four times a year and on their way. But now, especially based upon this data, we recognize that just giving some prednisone antibiotic is no longer acceptable and you really have to be very aggressive in treating patients with exacerbations."
"This is a good slide. And I think the point, it's not just, they underline moderate. It's not just severe exacerbations."
"I knew that I think, but I think primary care doctors, and again, I'm not sure where this, these slides are, who they're aimed at, but I think primary care doctors tend to disregard more mild exacerbations as no big deal, but it's all a big deal."
"So this again gets to what I was talking about before, the holy grail of C O P D medicines. Is there something that the FDA will allow you to say decreases mortality? And so if this product is true, then this is important information. That being said-"
"So, there've been a number of products in the past that have sought FDA indication for decreasing mortality and based upon statistics and whatever their scientific committees they did not give those, they did not give that label. So there's nothing currently labeled. So if this got on the label, this would be very important."
"That being said, when I'm viewing this critically, a couple things come to mind. So it's a secondary endpoint. It's not a primary endpoint of this study, number one. Number two, it says 49% reduction in mortality versus lahbalama. My guess is that is relative not absolute reduction.   00:33:22  And so that's sort of a statistical trick. The absolute reduction is more important, but what is important is the number needed to treat of 80. Is that good? Is that bad? That's an individual decision, but the concept of number needed to treat is something that is growing more and more. And for simple minded people like me, I get that. You need to treat 80 people with lahbalama to save one life. I guess I would want to know over what time period. Usually it says one year or five years, how long you need to stay on the drug to save a life. So that would be important data."
"Oh, it's very reasonable compared to other drugs for cardiovascular diseases or for example, you're familiar with getting screening CAT scans of the chest for lung cancer?"
"So that number needed to treat, I think is 320 people over five years. So when I see 80 I'm like, huh, that's better than screening CAT scan of the chest, but I still wonder what the time period is."
"I guess I also, I'm not a statistical wizard when I see Kaplan Meier Curve and over time I wonder about dropout and the censored data. What does that really mean? I guess I'd have to delve into it a little bit more, but I'm always wary of researchers dropping statistical tricks on me to make their drug look better."
"On the surface, if it's correct and I accept it at face value, it would be fairly compelling data."
"No, because it's something we've talked about for years. And honestly, my bias is is this triple combination really better than the other triples? Probably not, but they just happen to do the right study, to get the right combination, to prove what the other pharmaceutical companies have been talking about for decades. They just got lucky and proved it to allow the FDA to put this on their label. Good for them, I guess."
"Okay and so this says to me, this drug works because it's helping their heart not helping their lungs, which is, I guess, not surprising, but would beg the question, how does an inhaled steroid improve cardiovascular outcomes? And I don't know the answer to that, but that's what this suggests."
"Oh, it would be pure speculation. How does an inhaled steroid affect cardiovascular death? That would be the question to me. And maybe the inhaled steroid affects systemic mediators that are in the bloodstream. I would, it would be hard for me to believe that inhaled steroids would have a direct effect on the degree of coronary artery disease, certainly over a one year study that wouldn't be long enough to see that. So I would have to believe there would be some systemic anti-inflammatory effect of the inhaled steroid."
"I would say moderately because at the end of the day,   00:39:20  when I, so it's comparing it to the lahbalama, the cardiovascular death are no different compared to the ICS lama and the all cause mortality is not really different compared to ICS lama. So you could make a different slide to say, get rid of the Lama, really. That maybe the Lama is what's causing the cardiovascular deaths and it has nothing to do with the ICS. So it just gets at the same data. Again, I understand why they put it that way, but you could make the same headline to say Lamas are causing cardiovascular deaths because that's also the difference between the columns there."
"Well, again, it just breaks it, I mean, I think it's the data from the left side, that's on the right side in graphic form and it's displayed-"
"Right, and it's displayed to sort of make the product X look better. Again, it is what it is, but that's how the display put there to show the advantage of product X in comparison to the blahbalama."
"I guess so, I mean, again, it's really reflecting what's on the other side of the page there that we've already talked about, but I guess, yes."
"Yeah. I don't, I mean, I would, it's sort of duplicative, just repetitive data driving home the same point. I don't know that breaking it out necessarily makes it more compelling to me."
"Again,   00:42:27  It's a relative reduction focusing on the cardiovascular death. So it's cherry picking the data to make product X look better. I get why they do it, but it makes me feel like I'm being manipulated a little bit."
"I guess if I had to say, which is more important overall mortality or cardiovascular depth, they're both important, but overall mortality to me is the more important number that would make the data more significant."
"Well, I mean, again, I'm pessimistic about being manipulated by pharmaceutical companies. So that's just my overall view point. But good data is good data. So for absolute to relative reduction numbers, because relative reduction are things that the pharmaceutical companies do to make their numbers look better. But medically, overall reduction in mortality to me is, if I had to pick and choose, is more important than, because when you put them side by side, you say, ""Well, okay then the product X people though, if they're dying less cardiovascular deaths, they're dying more of something else."" I mean that's the only other conclusion is if they're not dying of cardiovascular death, they're dying of something different. And so I wouldn't have two separate numbers. I would just have the overall point they're trying to make."
"No, a bigger number has a bigger impression. I mean, I don't want to sound flip, obviously it does, but it is still a relative reduction."
"Yeah, and I get that. So far I've liked the slides. I like this slide the least because, I get what they're trying to say, but there's so, so many different things going on here, it's confusing. So, we're comparing-"
That inhalers work as well as cardiovascular drugs to save lives for heart disease.
"I don't believe it, even though, I mean, that's my reaction, but that's what the date is showing me. So it, but it's confusing because it's not saying don't give statins, don't give ACE agents. I guess that would be a confusing message. So do you mean if I give my patient a triple inhaler, they don't have to be on a statin drug or they don't have to be on lisinopril? Well, no, that's not at all what it says, but that would be one of the implications."
"I think it just drives home the point that it decreases all cause mortality similar to statins, ACE inhibitors, that it's a good drug. It raises more questions than it answers, I guess. It raises questions. I shouldn't say more questions, but it raises questions as well."
"So if you have a patient with con... I guess I'd like to see a study then that for example, shows C O P D cardiovascular patients that are given statins, triple inhalers, and both, and see if there's a difference. See which is the most important aspect of their treatment. That study will never be done, that I can see. But, which is more important? Can you get rid of some of those other drugs?"
There's a new inhaler that is been proven to decrease all cause mortality in cardiovascular C O P D patients. This is the first inhaler on the market that has that FDA indication. It improves all cause mortality primarily by decreasing cardiovascular deaths. The exact mechanism of action is uncertain. And the role of other cardiovascular medicine changes in patients on these inhalers remains open to further study.
"Because I'm still going to be aggressive in treating cardiova- in treating their C O P D. I guess theoretically, I shouldn't say no. I guess theoretically I would be more aggressive in using triple therapy."
I probably would use it earlier in patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease or risk factors.
"No. It just addresses a long term question,"
Is there a drug that decreases mortality in C O P D?
"No, it's throughout the conversation, I guess I'll be curious to see when this drug comes out, how it's marketed and what happens from there."
"Yep. Family medicine. So it's a Midwestern city might be a stretch. We have about 150,000 population service area. It is a clinic that is part of a network of clinics that is owned and operated by one of the two major hospital systems in the community. I've been here for 27 years. My particular clinic is in what most people would describe as a suburban location. I'm the only doctor, but I have a PA and a nurse practitioner that are here with me. It's mainly I guess some people say I'm fortunate and I probably am. Most of my patients do have coverage with commercial insurance because they're I guess what most people would describe either middle-upper to upper-income type folks. So I don't know if that helps or doesn't help or you need more, but that's kind of the background."
"Yeah, well, a lot. I mentioned the fact that I'm Midwestern. So my perception on this may or may not be accurate, but I can tell you that in our state location, as well as our border states, that there are not many specialist physicians in pulmonary medicine at all. And if they are available, they have a tendency to be more involved in critical care medicine, hospital-type medicine, that sort of thing. So the primary care doctors, and I'm going to put the nurse practitioners and PAs kind of under that overall umbrella. Although some people might get mad at me if I do that but anyway, the primary care providers have a tendency to take care of the overwhelming majority of COPD patients. I'm talking about from presentation initially through the diagnostic process, through the treatment process."
"And I can tell you that's been my mantra for 27 years since I've been here. That's not to say that I don't refer people at all. Of course, if I run into a problem there's comorbidity, or something isn't working right. I can't figure it out, that's the time to ask for a referral and we do have pulmonologists in town. That's not what I'm saying, but we try not to overwhelm them with every single person that has COPD. I mean that's clearly not what happens. So we do an overwhelming majority of the care. Yeah."
"Well, yeah. I will say there's some variability to that, but if in a month timeframe, I'm going to say it's at least 30. It could be up to 50. It kind of depends. So it's kind of probably, I don't know. And the average is probably 40."
"Well, of course, that sort of depends on trying to stage their disease process. I think when somebody comes in and we think about this in the differential, I'm probably like most people. I try to use my diagnostics to help with where the person is at. And I'm not trying to say that the history and the symptoms are not important, they are. And of course, you listen to those folks tell and you're going to get a reasonable, good sense based on the history and the physical as to whether they're in the mild, moderate, severe category. I kind of prefer to use the terminology in that way and I know that I mean, there are a variety of different severity measures out there. You get the COPD standards, you get the gold standards."
"You've got a bunch of other things that you can use, but I like to use that mild, moderate, severe because patients understand that. That's my thing. I don't get into Category A, B, C, and D. I know that those things exist and that's great, but anyway. So when the typical person comes in, yeah, what are we going to do? Well, we're going to do spirometry of course, because that's a really important tool. We may or may not do imaging. Somebody's got a smoking history, of course, yes, you're going to do imaging, it's regular chest x-ray standard, maybe CT, depending on that sort of thing. So those are our baseline things. So then you try to figure out where that person is. Now, I think most doctors most patients are going to come in and they're going to be in the mild stage hopefully."
"Because they recognize there's a problem and the sooner that they could do something, the better off you're going to be. So typically, the mantra is to start with a short-acting bronchodilator and if they can get by with that great, fantastic, no problem. I think if the person comes in and they got a bigger problem then we think about the LABA LAMA products more long-acting bronchodilators or muscarinic inhibitors as kind of the next out. Then if that doesn't work, then we add the inhaled corticosteroids, and then if that doesn't work, then we got person that's really got a bad deal. Then we're talking about multiple therapies, sometimes oral medications run a deal in that, and that sort of thing, but it's along that continuum, if you will, of short-acting bronchodilator may be short acting muscarinic inhibitor, and then there's some art to that."
"And, of course, I'm sure you've probably heard that if you've been talking to doctors about this. There's different feelings about do you combine your short actings before you go to a long-acting or do you add a long-acting and leave a short-acting and how all that interplay works? But the idea is the short-acting agents, to begin with. If that doesn't cut the muscard or if it's a more severe thing, you go onto the long-acting inhalers. Then if that doesn't work, you add your long-acting inhalers together and then you look at the steroid issue and you just keep going up the trees, so to speak."
"Really good question and I know I've been reading some things about that being people are saying, okay, for people that obviously have a bigger problem, or maybe they've been through step therapy and they haven't got great success, where does that role fit? I think there is a place for it. It's not something that I'm going to go to right out of the box, at least as I sit here right now because my way of thinking about that is, is that's a certain subset of the COPD population where we have been through the basics. We've already been through the short-acting that's not enough."
"We've been and maybe one or two of the long-acting agents and that's not enough and we got to get the steroid part of this right. So I think there's a place for it if you have that person that's in that scenario and you establish that the triple combination is making the person stable. I think the stability part of that, at least from my perspective seems to be the key. Certainly, convenience for the patient is part of that. I mean, if you're talking about triple inhaler yeah, that's a hell of a lot easier. Sorry. Heck of a lot easier. Sorry about-"
A heck of a lot easier than having to use three inhalers during the course of a day.
"I have not. My reading on this has primarily come from things that I've done in the continuing medical education, primarily through the Academy of Family Physicians."
"I think it's a good informational background slide. I'm not sure that I could have given you quoted numbers like that's on this slide, but I'm pretty sure that I was familiar with the severity just as an overall look-see at this. I'm not shocked by the one in 10 adult thing. I mean, I've heard that before in other contexts. I think I could have told you it was the third leading cause of death. I'm pretty sure I could have. I certainly agree with the over half being undiagnosed. Now, there's obviously several reasons for that some of which is frankly, access to care, which is another issue that we're certainly not going to solve here today. But there are, I think some issues with regards to diagnostic dilemmas that sometimes happen with these patients. And what I'm getting at there is at least me personally, I can tell you that it's not exactly as easy as what a lot of the textbooks will tell you because you have comorbidities, and oh boy, isn't that fun?"
"So if you got somebody with heart disease and COPD, sometimes this is not an easy thing to figure out. So the difficulty there does not surprise me and yeah, I mean, I don't do any inpatient hospital work anymore, because we have hospice within our system that take care of that sort of thing. But of course, I follow up with all the patients that I have in my panel that have been in the hospital. I get the emergency room encounter documents. Yeah. This is a disease entity which uses a lot of healthcare resources that there is no question about that. And whether you're talking about ER, inpatient kind of stuff, recurrences, it's a thing. So I'm not sure about any of this stuff. Yeah."
"Well, the only comment I'm going to have here and it's you told me not to think about how others look at this."
"I'm going to say something that somebody might critique. I would not necessarily critique this, but I can understand how maybe a different physician would ask you're giving me data about the world. What about the United States?"
"I'm going to also give that a six. I mean the numbers here are very much consistent with what I know about it, to begin with. Yeah."
"Well, I'm going to give that a four only because I kind of probably have a heightened sensitivity to this sort of thing anyway. I'm trying to say, okay, well, just because I get this information, is it going to make me change the way I do things? It just reinforces some things I think. So that's the reason for the four and not higher."
"Yeah. So part of what this slide is getting at is the social determinants of health issue, which are really a big deal going on right now in the primary care world and you're right. There is definitely a differentiation here with respect to socioeconomic status. I'm pretty sure I could have filled this map out with fair degree of accuracy if somebody asked me where are the high endemic portions of the world."
"And so A is, that's a no-brainer. I mean, industrial countries with lots of smoking and poor healthcare systems, and lots of environmental issues that nobody really pays attention to. The same thing could be said about Africa. Same thing can be said about South America. The issue in the United States has always been our continued fight against the smoking issues and just from a public health perspective. But the other thing I like about this slide is it talks about the comorbidity issues and especially with the obesity epidemic we have in the United States, this is a deal. It makes things much more challenging and I think that's the real reason why the US has such a bad outcome on this with regards to COPD is because of the obesity epidemic has skewed that. So anyway, that's just my thoughts on it."
"Change my thinking. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to give this... Well, I don't want to be the same as what I just said. I'm going to give this a three. And the reason is I already knew this. There isn't anything earth-shattering on this slide and I'm not sure I could even tell you that. I mean, I get the statistics with the map and all that other kind of stuff. I mean, I already know we got an issue from a mortality perspective. Do the values and the key on the map do anything for me? Not necessarily, I guess so that's the reason for the three, I guess."
"I really like that graphic on the right-hand side. I talk so much with my patients about functional outcomes of disease management, and it doesn't make any difference whether we're talking about COPD or musculoskeletal thing, or high blood pressure, it doesn't make any difference. Yeah. This cascade of what I will call if you don't take care of your chronic condition, bad things happen. And the other thing I like about it is it incorporates what I call the biopsychosocial model, right? Because it talks about the mental health aspects and the quality of life. The only thing it doesn't talk about is the economic issues, which I will tell you is another issue for people. I mean, it gets bad people can't work. They got to go on short-term disability, maybe long-term disability. They're applying for social security disability, et cetera, et cetera. Not good. So I really like that graphic on the right-hand side. On the left-hand side, those statistics are significant because they're high. So I think it is... I think some people would be surprised at that percentage values. I'm not-"
"Like I said, the only thing I would add is an economic burden."
"Maybe that's another, well, I don't know what, maybe it's a dollar sign with the... What is that magenta? Maroon? I can't tell."
"Yeah. But I think you could add economic burden to patient and family or something like that. I mean, I think that would even add something to it."
"I'm going to go with it. I'm going to go with a six, not quite a seven. Almost a seven, or I'm going to say six."
Yeah. I think that's a five. I think that does a good job of getting people to think different.
"Okay. So I am, again, you told me not to think about it the way other people think, but that's hard for me to do that."
But I will tell you that sort of like the things that we don't know about as physicians that should make you worry that's that lower left hand one.
"That is like I said, I'm not surprised at that statistic, but that is a big deal."
"Well, this is a science data slide clearly, which I mean, you have some physicians that are driven by graphs and these sorts of things, which I get. I'm not necessarily one of those people, although I don't dislike it, but you always have some doctors that are more scientific than others. Again, none of this information is surprising to me. I think to give you absolute value numbers from actual studies is helpful because you always got some people that are saying, well prove it. So here you go. I mean, here's the data. So they can't say that the data doesn't exist or, oh, you're just using a generality or whatever."
"Well, okay. So to me, one of the important messages about the differentiation of the severity condition, when you're talking about exacerbations is how important it is to stabilize people's treatment early in the disease process. And because your data illustrates why that's important, if you have a mild condition, okay."
If you're not stabilizing that patient things are going to go south fast.
"And you don't want to get to that point. So I don't know, there's probably a couple different thought processes about how you could make that stand out with that right-sided graph. I mean, you might put it in bolder or bigger type. You might use a color that is more jump off the page, like a scarlet red kind of thing, as opposed to what it is. I mean, there's different. I mean, I know in the marketing world, there's lots of different things you can do but I think to focus on that big decline if you're not stabilizing people early in the disease stages is really an important thing."
"Also, a seven, because I mean, all that stuff at the bottom is the data, is the studies. So there you go."
"Yeah. I'm going to give that one a six again, because of the focus, there is on getting people stabilized early."
"Yeah. Well, if you don't stabilize and limit exacerbations people die. I mean, it's as simple as that. This interestingly the last CME thing that I did on this was actually focused on this particular issue of mortality. So, the activity was intended to get you to, I think, wake up to the fact that it doesn't take many exacerbations to create bad problems. Right. I think that's the message. Yeah."
"Well, not to me. Again, I think there may be some people that would be surprised at the 80% death risk with two moderate exacerbations. I think some people might be shocked at that. I'm not, but I mean, that's a big number."
"No, I actually think this slide gets the message across really well."
"Well, I think the high number statistically, as far as what happens with the death rate, if you don't stabilize people is just really the key here. I mean, when you really think about it, how many other chronic medical conditions have this bad of numbers? There aren't many. I mean, I'd have to go look what it is for angina, with people that have ischemia heart disease, it's probably similar. Well, no, I don't think it is similar. I think it's not as high as this. So I mean, these numbers are significant. That's the only way I can say it."
"Yeah. So this is slightly different focus. This is focused on other risk factors for comorbidities and it's an important slide because I think sometimes people might think about heart disease issues and COPD but might not necessarily know that it's this bad. I'm not sure. I'm not sure I knew the 90% statistic for up to a year. I think I knew the CV event after the first 10 days. That's pretty well known. And I think I knew the stroke statistics, but that 90%, I think that's a new one to me and of course, that's a big number."
"I think also a seven. I mean, again, you get the data points there at the bottom. I mean they throw it right out there to you. Yeah."
Oh gosh. It's probably between a six or a seven. I'm going to say a six.
"I knew all this. This is almost like the no-brainer or duh slide. I'll tell you. It's like who wouldn't think that if you have both heart disease and COPD that you're going to have worse things happen to you? I mean, yeah. I mean, it's common sense. Right? So, yeah. I mean, to me, this is just a reinforcement slide."
"Well, no, I don't think so. I mean, the information's correct, and I can't think of a better way to present it. I think that's okay."
"Relevance. Well, it is relevant, but it is as important as the other things? No, I'm going to give it a five."
"I already knew this stuff, so I'm going to give it a... Let's give it a three."
"This is almost similar to the, well, I don't know. You're not supposed to... You told me not to convert-"
"Very similar to the concepts of the one we just looked at with regards to the comorbidity issue. The people that are really into research are going to like this slide because it gives you all of the relevant clinical trials on things, which to be honest with you is kind of cool. I'm not sure that I've ever seen anything like this, where it compares all the relevant studies in a one-graph kind of a deal. So I like the way that this has been put together. Does it necessarily add anything information-wise, above and beyond what I already knew? I don't think so. So from an informational standpoint, again, it's more of a reinforcement thing than anything."
"This would be a great slide for medical school or for a residency presentation. Absolutely love for those two things. I do just a little bit of teaching, not a lot to med students and residents, but yeah. I mean, okay, so, again, this isn't something that I didn't know before. I know this stuff. But it makes you think about things a little bit differently because it does actually get you to think about the physiology of what's happening with the interaction between heart disease and COPD."
"No, don't change it because I like the simplicity of it and the presentation of it."
It does make one think differently about it because of the focus on the physiology. So I'm going to give it a six.
"Good, good, good slide. Like it. I like the design too, step by step by step. Think about these things. Yeah."
"No, I like it. It's like, remember these three things and it's clinical, right? I mean these are the three things that are decision tree points and when you manage patients."
"I'm going to give credibility a five, but I'm going to tell you why-"
Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to say five. I'm not giving it higher because I kind of already knew this.
"More than what I used to, and again, this whole concept of airway high hyperresponsiveness secondary to inflammatory markers is at an increased concentration, I think at this point. And I think sometimes... How should I put this? In the past, I'm not sure that looking at the eosinophil counts necessarily entered our mindset as the best way to monitor that inflammatory cascade, but recent stuff that I've read again, simply through CME stuff makes me think that it really is an important thing. So when somebody comes in for their recheck, it is not uncommon for me to order that white cell differential to look at that now, whereas it wasn't necessarily an automatic, it's becoming an automatic."
"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess what I'd say about this is yeah, a good information, but I think a common sense person that maybe didn't know anything about COPD would be able to figure this out."
"So, yeah, I mean, it's, again, reinforcing information. Is it all that valuable? I'm not sure."
"Well, it's credible. I'm going to give that a seven."
"Yeah. I mean, it's good information, but again, it's more reinforcing stuff that I already knew."
Probably not. I'm not sure what you would do to make it any better.
"No, I think that graphic is really spot on."
"Yeah, so, well, I think it's what I said before. If there's anything in the last, I guess, year to year and a half, that has changed my way of clinical monitoring, I think is probably the right way of saying it with the patients that are on inhaled corticosteroids. It's this."
"Yeah. Okay. So this, to me, this is the key thing that's being discussed right now is... And what this gets at is, are we not approaching this the way we should be? In other words, with most of your guidelines, still say that the stepwise approach to this is the correct thing to do, at least for people that have a presentation that's mild, to begin with. But I think the debate right now is that the right approach to things. And I think that's what this slide is getting at. I will tell you personally, I have not made that up in my mind yet one way or the other if that makes sense. Hello?"
"Here's the thing and I'll point out. I think that there's a lot of guidelines that still advocate for approaching COPD in a stepwise treatment fashion. But there's discussion now about whether or not that actually is the proper way of looking at this. I think I'm not sure I in my brain have that settled as far as what's right or what's wrong. I will recognize that I think there's a trend, at least as I see it of earlier treatment with longer-acting medications than what I've seen before."
"Well, no, I don't think so, because I think that this communicates that concept of maybe we need to rethink about how we approach this and I mean, it does, it, in a way that's non-confrontational, which I think is good."
And I think the statistics make you start thinking about maybe I should be a little more aggressive in what I have been. So I think the way it's presented is fine.
I'm going to give that one a five only because I know it's in a debate flux right now.
"Yeah. Well, okay duh. I mean the four things on the left-hand side of the equation are medical school 101. I don't know. Do the stats on the right-hand side do anything for me? Not really."
Oh yeah. It's credible. It's probably a seven.
"Well, I think the overall message that I take from it is COPD is a bad disease and it turns out to be bad if it's not managed correctly. We can talk about reasons why it's not managed correctly, but I do think that a lot of the messaging here gets at the fact that we need to do a better job of quantifying people's difficulty and getting them on a stable regimen sooner rather than later."
"Well, I think I shared with you that I knew a lot of the information, to begin with. I think what it does is it reinforces me to be perhaps a little more aggressive with people in the treatment paradigm compared to what I used to before. I think that we talked a little bit about the eosinophil count, and I think that is becoming a more standardized way of answering that question. So those are the main things."
"Well, I think the message here is it performs better across variable ways of measuring, compared to the combination agents that only have two things that don't include the inhaled steroid?"
"I think it does it pretty well. Yeah. One of the... Just from memory here, now, one of the slides that the only negative or potential question that I have is there was one slide that used the term adjudicated cases."
"I mean, I do some medical-legal work and adjudicated cases to me means somebody sued somebody for... Somebody ran into them with a motor vehicle accident now they're having medical problems and they're going to court to sue them over that. To me, that's where my mind goes with adjudicated cases and I'm quite sure that's not what they mean here."
"Yeah, well, it's those patients that have... Okay. So it would be not just the initial presentation, but the patient that has more moderate symptoms where the level of disease is concerning enough that you want to give them the best opportunity to be stable, right from the get-go."
"It would probably be somewhere in the middle and I wouldn't have necessarily said that a year ago, but again, based primarily on the stuff that I've been reading about it... I think it used to be looked at as a more end-stage maybe third in the step or fourth in the step. Now, I think it's probably looked at as an alternative after the short-acting agents."
"And in other words, when you start thinking about the long-acting agents, whether that's beta-agonist or muscarinics I think this now has to be looked at, in context with those options as well."
"No. I mean, I'm not sure I necessarily would say that. It's just, I think it's moved itself up in the hierarchy of things to consider."
"Oh boy. Okay. So, I would definitely keep C."
I kind of want to keep A and D. I think I can do without B.
I want to keep F. I think I want to keep G. I could probably do without H and I.
"I want to keep K. The other ones I can do without, although I want to put J in my teaching slide set."
Yeah. I think I want to keep both N and O because I can't get rid of N or O because I think they're two independent thought processes that are important to the whole story.
Yeah. I think I might want to put in between G and K.
"No, I think that's the only change I would make because I think what I want to do is introduce the concept on the eosinophil count before I talk about management principles."
"All right. So the bottom line is COPD's a major healthcare issue for a lot of people, and it has impact on the entire biopsychosocial economic model. It's important to understand the treatment of disease needs to be stabilized as soon as possible to avoid hospitalization, death, and increased risk of future complications. One of the more recent management strategies is to look at the eosinophil count, and that helps improve the management of the patient. It is important to think about more aggressive treatment earlier in the disease process to accomplish the goals."
Wow. That's tough. Hmm. I want to go with K.
"Well, to me, that's the one that's the keeper, as far as the clinical decision processes are concerned."
"Hello everyone. And thank you. We now have the Doctor in the line. Mindy, you may go ahead."
Yep. That's fine. Thank you for being flexible. I appreciate it. Sorry about the  inaudible 00:01:15 .
"Yeah, so I'm a cardiology working in a rural community hospital, but very busy tertiary care center and see all sorts of patients, lots of pulmonary and cardiac disease and the same patients."
Probably the diabetes and the kidney disease.
"Somewhat concerning. I mean, it's just one of the things that these patients have, and it can also make them short of breath and they come in complaining of shortness of breath it becomes difficult to tell what's what."
"If I'm treating a patient with diabetes, then I usually will defer all the diabetes decision making to the primary care Doctor and the Endocrinologist and just focusing the heart disease."
"I usually leave it to the primary, if they need some help, I'll be happy to help."
"Well, assuming they... To start with labs and EKG and an echo are usually the main things that I start with.  inaudible 00:05:01 ."
"Well, it depends on kind of what the patient tells me. If they have had a hundred pack of smoking history, then I certainly would look at working at those. But if they've never smoked before then, no, not necessarily."
Or if they've got like obstructed sleep apnea or something like that.
"Well, you could do a right hard task or a just start with PSTs and ABG. All of those."
Both. I'll order the task and then get pulmonary involved.
"Always. I mean, if they... It is always Part of my thoughts and consideration."
"Well, it becomes tough because especially if they've got regular heart disease and you don't know what's causing them to be short of breath, or if they have heart failure, and they come into the hospital complaining of shortness of breath, it can be challenging to figure out is it related to the heart failure or is it related to the COPD and which is going to treat more aggressively or that type of thing."
"Just in training and if patients need a refill here or there I'll do that for them, but nothing more than that."
"Certainly, yeah. Right. When that's their primary disease process, making them short of breath. Yeah."
"Well, it's nothing... It's almost, it's more that pulmonary manages them rather than I'm managing them, but if it's at least for COPD for like pulmonary hypertension, then there's probably more sub management."
"But for COPD, if you know it I feel like the patient's shortness of breath isn't really... Is out a proportion to their cardiac disease I'll call the pulmonary Doc and say, ""Hey, I think we need to do more for the COPD. What other options do we have?"" That type of thing."
"Again, because the pulmonary Doc is not following these patients as well."
"Well, I asked them how well their COPD is controlled."
"Yeah, I ask them. It comes up when I ask them how well it's controlled. They tell me if it's controlled or not."
"Well, COPD I feel like it's almost a separate disease. I don't really feel like there's that much of a connection. Although just in terms of symptom management, it can be challenging, like we talked about."
"I don't feel like they have an impact on one another, unlike diabetes and kidney disease, which can directly impact heart disease. COPD though you can have very severe COPD and totally normal heart. We see that all the time."
"I wouldn't say that it would, I don't mean, again, I don't think it's totally separate."
"Okay. I've never heard of these studies, but I guess result of substantial proportion."
So this slide is basically saying that Patients who have COPD die of other causes as well. Is that... Am I reading that right?
The way that I'm interpreting the slide is that Patients who have COPD die of other causes as well. Is that right?
"Well, it's just not cardiac and cancer related death represent this substantial proportion of reported causes of death in COPD. I would maybe add this headline is not good. I didn't slide any papers patients. I would maybe rephrase it and say patients with COPD often die of   00:17:33 "
"Yeah. I can't say much more than that. It's just a statement of fact. So yeah. I mean, I agree."
"Again, it makes sense. It's pretty linear obviously people who have COPD are much likely and more likely to smoke until when you smoke, you have heart failure and heart disease and heart attacks, et cetera. So that makes sense. And then if you have COPD and heart disease, you're more likely to die. Again, they're all very factual statements."
"Well, it's just the more diseases you have, the more likely you are to die from one or more than diseases and the sicker you are going to be, so."
"Yeah. I mean, you can have the same slide and say individuals with kidney disease have a two times greater risk of having CV. In fact with kidney disease is probably like four or five times and then that would increase your mortality. This you can substitute COPD with almost any disease or diabetes, kidney disease.  inaudible 00:20:19 ."
Right. So you'd have a much higher risk of dying if you have one of those diseases with CV. Yeah.
"No. They're just connected to the same person. It's not connected as in they don't make each other worse. It's just that if you have the more diseases you have as a human being, like the more things are wrong with you, the more likely you are at die."
 inaudible 00:21:02 . Okay. That's new information.
That you're more likely to have a stroke or heart attack in the dates following a COPD exacerbation.
"Well, we need to do something about that."
So I'm curious to see what's on your next slide.
"Yeah, I didn't really know that, to be honest, I didn't really think about that. I mean, assuming this is all true, so I don't... I've never seen this data before elsewhere, so."
"Well, just the fact that we would want to be more proactive. I mean, I don't know. Maybe there's no way. There is nothing. Maybe this is just, again, a statement of fact, and there's nothing you can do about it being more aggressive. I guess, if you can prevent COPD exacerbations is probably the best. So I just need to prevent as many COPD exacerbations as possible, but I feel like we're already, that's the goal anyway, it's not like we're treating these patients and helping them hoping some of them have exacerbations."
I don't know what a moderate exacerbation is versus the mild.
"Well, maybe it's how we're treating them. Maybe it's the steroids that caused them to be more likely to have a heart attack or stroke."
It's a significant drop in Mortality. That's good.
"I would say this medication saves lives, But you'd have to treat 80 patients in order to save what one life versus The standard of here."
"Interesting. I mean, if you look at the Standard of care, which is the gray line here, the top, even if you look at the top dark gray line, the  inaudible 00:26:05  the one year mortality rate's only 3% and this thing only drops it to like one and a half percent."
"It's not that we're going from 20% to 5% or something. It's significant, but it's not something that's Earth shattering, I guess."
"We're used to much smaller number needed to treat in like cardiology, medications."
"Like less than 50, I think would be reasonable. I'm not saying that we wouldn't use this, but."
"No. I mean, I would assume that they would know this data and use it.  inaudible 00:27:07 ."
"No, not necessarily. I mean, I would just maybe ask them about this particular medicine. If that patient's a candidate, that's probably the only thing I would do differently. I wouldn't start it myself."
"Okay. So here, like if you look at the cardiovascular events, it looks like you have the least number of events with the inhaled corticosteroid long-acting beta the light gray."
"On the right hand side, the cardiovascular in the bar graph there.   00:29:07 ."
"All of it. Yeah I mean, almost all of it, I guess. Pretty much everything except for CV that's where they're equal. Yeah, The kind of the older medicine is just as good."
"No, I mean, they're equal there's nothing that, where this new product X is better than what's already out on the market. According to this slide is really very not making the case very well."
"I don't use that medicine, so I don't know. Yeah, I can't really speak to that, but obviously it's doing better than LABA/LAMA but I mean this other medicine where if you go back to your other slide, if you compare I think that obviously the company wants us to compare LAMA/LABA to product X. But if you compare ICS, inhaled care for steroid to the product X it's really not that much different. You see your reduction in mortality goes down only by like 0.2 or 3%. Your number there is probably 200 plus. I don't know what percentage of care is now for COPD patients. But I wouldn't... This really doesn't... This makes me less excited."
"That's just the same as what's on the right. It's just written out. It's nothing different really. Oh, I'm sorry. I just did see the cancer and respiratory causes again. I'm just looking at the first and the third columns there under product X. I'm just ignoring the middle column and really the differences are not hold up."
"0.3%. Really no. I mean, that's what we saw on the last slide I think. It's really not that much of a difference."
"Again, this slide just makes me watch, excited about this particular therapy."
"I mean, I don't even know if any of these things would reach the statistical significance between the first and third columns."
Not really. Cause look at the... Move your mouse over to the ICS-LABA. It's the same.
"To be honest I don't know why anyone would be using the LABA/LAMA because it seems like it doesn't, it works... It's not as good as the ICS-LABA. I don't know why anyone would be using LABA/LAMA."
"I would ask the pulmonary Doc, why they're doing that? If they would consider changing to a different medicine."
"Probably I mean, I don't know, I'm not a pulmonary Doctor, but I would say probably the inhaled corticosteroid option."
I think I'm assuming it's going to be a much cheaper.
"Yeah. I mean, this is it's going to be the same thing now they're just Peeling off the..."
How is this different from the  inaudible 00:34:58 .
"Again, that doesn't do anything for me after seeing what I just saw."
"And because of the white gray, the ICS-LABA shows zero, I mean that number would be 0% difference if they were comparing it."
So is there a new product now? What's product Y? Is it the same?
"Okay. So it's just a different version of product X, essentially just another formulation of product X."
"Two different treatments, but the same. It's like two different  inaudible 00:37:15 "
"Got you. Okay. Again, I think the compare, yes, it's nice that they've put big cardiac studies, but it's misleading, cause you're comparing it to these numbers would not be 1, 8, 3, and 1.2, if you compare it to ICFs and inhaled cover for and LABA alone. You're compare it on  inaudible 00:37:42 "
"I think if you just take this slide out of context, it looks really impressive. But then after seeing what I've just seen, it doesn't mean anything to me because you're comparing this to LAMA/LABA instead of ICS-LABA on the right product X and Y being compared to the wrong drug, I would argue that they need to be compared to ICS-LABA."
Which coincidentally is the only inhaler that I've prescribed. I've never prescribed a LAMA/LABA.
A couple years. So things have changed I'm sure. But even then though it looks like ICS-LABA is much safer overall.
"Yeah. But this is they're just picking cherry picking studies. So depending on what study you look at, I mean, they're... I think they're looking at, I don't know if this is all correct, to be honest. I'm fairly certain there two inhibitors of them on much lower number needed to treat there, but either way it doesn't matter because the number needed to treat on the right hand side, those would be much higher. It'd be over 200 if you compare it to ICS-LABA."
"So either way, I mean. I mean maybe the number needed to treat on the cardiac stuff is fine, but the number needed to treat on the right is definitely not this kind of false advertising in my book."
"No, I think we just need to make sure we prevent patients from getting into any kind of exacerbation, but that's basically what we've what... I already knew that would be bad. I just didn't know how bad it was in terms of stroke and heart disease and MI risk.   00:40:59 ."
"Again, I think the only, the major thing is just making sure that we prevent as many COPD exacerbations as possible  inaudible 00:42:13 ."
  00:42:54  Yes. You're welcome and thanks for being flexible. I appreciate it. Take care.
"Okay. So my primary specialty is Pulmonary and Critical Care, and I've been in practice for 19 years and I'm in a private practice. We are in a suburb of a large city here in the US, and we're a total of 15 physicians and the practice divided between inpatient and outpatient. So inpatient basically we see patients in the hospital for pulmonary, as well as the ICU, so it could be inpatient pulmonary consultations or patient admitted to the ICU. So we conduct daily rounds for those patients. And then the office, we see patients in the office basically for pulmonary disease. I mean, COPD, asthma, lung cancer, things like that. We do PFT and chest x-rays in the office as well. And as I say, I've been in practice for 19 years."
"Okay. The first line of treatment, I've used LAMA, which could be either a monotherapy or it could be the LAMA, LABA. If the patient are a little bit to start with a moderate or they have more symptoms. So I do, as I say, LAMA or LAMA/LABA. Then if patients were severe, they have exacerbations, I'll consider the ICS. And we've been using more the closed triple therapy, one inhaler  inaudible 00:03:50  therapy instead of a combination of inhalers. And we also like the inhaler bronchodilators. And as we progress, if patients are severe, we'll see if they are candidate for home oxygen, BiPAP, noninvasive positive pressure ventilations, things like that. But those are mainly the category of drugs that we use in COPD patients."
"The main reason, because most of the patients who get referred to us are mostly the moderate to severe, since we are specialist. Because my cases, those could be managed by the primary care physician. So we don't have a lot of mild COPD patient. So the majority of our patient population are moderate to severe. So this is why we use more triple therapy than probably the average."
"One is the convenience. So it's one  inaudible 00:05:36  instead of two or three. The other thing, especially with the Breztri, improve mortality, reducing hospital admissions, exacerbations, compared to the dual therapy. Improving mortality in patients with moderate severity. This is what we are getting mainly from, I mean, I'm going to mention the company because we meet with them frequently, AstraZeneca, basically."
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). I mean, one thing which is still not answered very well is, because we have two of them, is if one is better than the other, Trelegy versus Breztri, one better than the other. Because Trelegy is only once a day, Breztri, is twice a day, so Trelegy is more convenient. That's the main question one better than the other, because I don't think they run any trials comparing them to each other."
"I mean, it's a major healthcare problem. I agree with the topics. It's very common and a lot of admissions, exacerbations, things like that. Plus the undiagnosed part, especially the early cases, which is also correct. A lot of those patients might go undiagnosed for a while. So I agree it's a major health problem. I mean work   00:10:06 "
"I mean, one in 10 adults, I'm little bit surprised. 384 that, I know it's high, but I don't know that was that high.   00:10:19  And the admissions and that's also surprising to me. I'm assuming if it's true... Because yeah. I don't know, that seems high, those two numbers, one internal   00:10:32  the admission rate."
"I think it's pretty much, find the problems, I would say."
"I mean, I would say five, because I want to say about those numbers. Because as I said, that seems a little high, one in 10 and present three admissions."
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Just because I know it's a major problem.
"I mean, the numbers are hard to understand especially significance compared with England."
"The risk factors, the smoking, pollution, the fuel, patients related risk factors associated with COPD. The only thing I would say about the mortality rate, it does... Some countries might not have good reporting systems, so I don't know how accurate those numbers. I mean, they   00:15:29  look under reported, Russia versus US. I don't know how good the reporting data in some countries, third world countries, things like that."
"The long term health conditions I would say, it could be associated with other problems, it's not only the lungs. Talking about BMI, blood sugar, high blood pressure, so it can increase the risk for other disease rather, than just lungs."
 inaudible 00:16:27  make from the mortality to be honest.
Yeah. I'm not sure what to make from those mortality rates data.
"And I would say three because of this mortality rate. I'm just questioning those data just because of different countries, how they report it."
"And I'll say five because it make the awareness that COPD might, could be a risk factor for other disease like high blood pressure, diabetes, things like that."
"Right side? No, I think it's clear in terms of the risk factors and the likelihood of the health related issues. So yeah. I don't think I'll make any change."
"I mean, COPD. It's definitely... I put it a step backwards in any patients with COPD because there's always, it's some permanent loss of lung functions. Even if the patients recover, usually lung function do not recover completely. And it's going to definitely increase up in other products, including mortality. So there's risk for, again, more exacerbations, quality of life, things like that. Plus, I would say that as well, increase mortality. So the attempt is side the importance of preventing exacerbations in COPD patients. And it's common and definitely have worse prognosis."
"The under reported of exacerbations 50 to 70, I mean, that's a big range. I would say probably 50, 70, that seems too high."
"Again, the causes are usually more in the severe range. So probably most of our patients call earlier so the numbers could be different amount. Could be a primary care physician's patients might not report it. I mean, yeah. 78% seems too high, so that's also surprising to me."
"I would say with the last one on the right, when they talk about COPD exacerbations. You can mention also mortality, high risk of mortality in patients with the exacerbation. Talk about that   00:20:47  conditioning further exacerbation, but I would say also high mortality."
"Because of the list of the under reported, 78% under reported and under  inaudible 00:21:18 "
"I would say, not going to make much difference because we know, exacerbations is worse. I mean, it's accurate information, but I would say, since we are aware of it, so I would say probably two, it's not going to change much because we know it's important."
"Yeah. With every exacerbations there is some permanent loss of the lung functions, which we know that. So there has been some decline when patients have the exacerbation. As they recover, there's definitely some improvements, but they don't go back to their baseline. So there is some permanent loss of the lung functions for exacerbations, which emphasize the fact that  inaudible 00:22:48 ."
"The rate of decline for the mild COPD, 87 and how they end up losing... But at the same time those files, their baseline numbers probably are higher than the moderate or severe."
"Because it sounds worse, but if you look at the actual numbers, it might not be that bad. I don't know if that's probably  inaudible 00:23:27  they're reported by percent, what percent FEV1 is lost. I don't know if it's going to be different or not. Because now it's, we might say 87 versus 20. This is four times, but patients with mild COPD, their FTV1 is 70% compared to somebody who's 50%."
"As if it's   00:23:53  be comparable, even though the value are worse, just because my patients, they have a lot higher numbers to start with. So I think probably it's going to be better if they put it as a percent."
"I would say no, because we know that there's always permanent loss of the lung function after each exacerbations, so I would say two."
"I'll say it will be better if they put it as a percent, because if somebody look at those slides, they might think exacerbations carry worse prognosis for the mild compared to moderate or severe just because the loss seems more. But it could be a bit misleading, I see.   00:25:20 "
"Increase mortality with each exacerbations. Which emphasize the fact that, we should do our best to prevent exacerbations as well because of the increase is more, especially if they have multiple exacerbation, more than three exacerbations. The risk of that is way higher than patients with no exacerbations."
"The 80%, if they are two exacerbations within a year, it seems a little high, the risk of death."
"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, the left, the lower left."
"No, I would say, it's clear messages. The graphs are clear to understand, so there's nothing vague about it."
" inaudible 00:28:42  mortality. So it's a known fact. I mean it's important, but it's something good, extremely new, I would say."
"COPD has a risk factor for cardiovascular or CVA, basically, increase the risk."
"The risk, especially after a year for the cardiovascular event, 90%. I mean, it could be so, I don't know, but concerning, I would say definitely just seems high as well, 90% up to a year. It's surprising."
"And those stroke, I would say that's sounds like a reasonable, especially with the exacerbations. Because those patients could be hypoxic. So I'm not surprised about five, six to 10, but total bit surprised, up to a year, 90% increase after a year. I mean it could be, but  inaudible 00:31:02 ."
" inaudible 00:31:28  so we start paying attention to other problems, rather than just the COPD, just focus on the COPD."
 inaudible 00:31:38  for cardiovascular disease.
"I would say no, but there is a way, but I don't know, it's going to be significant to that slide to try to minimize the risk, the 90%. But sometimes we miss that. For us, especially for specialists, because we focus on the lungs."
"What could be, what we can do to minimize the risk or is there at all, for the primary care or cardiology, things like that, to focus on the cardiovascular rather than just the COPD."
Okay. So yeah. Talks about the association between COPD and mainly cardiac disease.
I would say no. Definitely there's a high risk of mortality if they have both compared to one.
"I would say the message on the left sounds a little different from the message on the right. Because the one on the left say COPD increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. But the one on the right, just talk about mortality if those two conditions coexist other than one cause the other one, in the   00:34:14 "
"Because I mean, the one on the right could be expected. If patients have more comorbidities, they have higher risk of death, but the one can cause the other. Because the one on the left, like individual with COPD, they have a greater risk of having cardiovascular disease, trying to link COPD to cardiovascular disease. The one on the right, just like a general message. The more comorbidities you have, the high risk of death. Other than having clear correlation, one cause the other or vice versa."
Yeah. I would say six. They left the information.
"I would say five, just, think of about the other risk factors or the risk of cardiovascular disease and COPD. If we're probably going to make us focus a little bit more on the cardiovascular disease rather than just the COPD by itself."
" inaudible 00:36:41  from cardiovascular disease compares to patients with severe COPD, the graph on the right. I mean, what's the main message? Yes, severe COPD, they're probably going to die from COPD, moderate COPD, because the disease is not severe, so they're probably going to die from something else, but what's their message here? What they're trying to tell us? If we have somebody with severe COPD, not to focus on their cardiovascular disease? I found... Yeah. I'm not sure I get what's the percent, but this could be they're dying from heart disease because their lung disease is not severe, so they're going to die from something else."
"So here it sounds like moderate COPD increased cardiovascular disease, but severe COPD does not, I mean, which is not true, I would say. I'm sure patients  inaudible 00:37:36  who do have cardiovascular disease, but just because their lung disease is more severe is what they're dying, from the lung disease."
"Found it a bit misleading, the message, like   00:38:21  cardiovascular there and severe COPD."
"I linked the COPD to cardiovascular disease. Why cardiovascular disease risk increase in patients with COPD? I mean, true, the main risk factor, the smoking, pollution, things like that. Plus the COPD by itself, including the hyperinflation, the hypoxia, things like that and their effect on the cardiac function. So yeah. I mean, relationship of one versus the other, why COPD increase the cardiovascular disease? Or why patient with COPD have higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared to the non COPD?"
It does pique the interest and I don't know if it's going to make much difference or no.
"I would say five, something like, good to know, that makes much difference."
"Yeah. I would say six, I mean, six or even seven. I mean it's credible."
I'll say three because we already know those mechanisms.
The risk for exacerbations. Past history of COPD symptoms.
"I would say they can add on the other risk factors for exacerbation; smoking, smokers and also noncompliance with medications, which is also a major risk factor for exacerbations. In here this where the patient cannot afford the inhalers or use the wrong techniques, things like that. So I would say smoking and then compliance. This is also one of the most common reason for exacerbations."
"Any exacerbations going to increase the risk of, or the frequency of future exacerbations."
"The last is clear, the right one, I would say, it's clear, although it takes me a little bit, like five years   00:43:53  then one year 0.1, some more exacerbation is going to shorten the times or the subsequent-"
"I would say, it's very clear.  inaudible 00:44:08  a little bit longer for the one on the right."
"I would say yes. I mean, any patients who have any exacerbations should be treated very aggressively. And this is why we ask all the patients, if they come for six months, ""Did you have any exacerbation in last six months?"" Whether we know about it or we don't. Because sometimes patients report it or they just go to the hospital or urgent care without telling us. So definitely it's important knowing any exacerbations, they have any exacerbations, we definitely want to be more aggressive. Because we know that increase the risk of future exacerbations so it's definitely important."
I would say no. I would say it's pretty clear.
"I would say it's three because, just because I've been aware of it and we ask patients constantly if they have any recent exacerbations since their last visit."
"Okay. Correlate the severity of the symptoms with the exacerbations, which might translate into a more severe COPD or more advanced airway obstruction."
"No. I'd say it's clear between the different scores, I mean the worse the symptoms, the higher risk of exacerbations."
"One thing we know is COPD, some patients may be more symptomatic than others, even though they might have the same degree of airway obstructions. And we're more aggressive in treating those patients, especially if we maximize their medications, like to think about pulmonary rehab, which is one factor to reducing exacerbations. And one thing we are probably aggressive, send the patient with rehab if they have symptoms regardless of the degree of airway obstruction."
"So that might emphasize the fact that we should look also at the symptoms for exacerbations and probably recommending pulmonary rehab, I would say, because even some patients, they might have mild moderate COPD, but they are very symptomatic. Some patients with moderate COPD, they have symptoms so higher or worse symptoms definitely correlate with exacerbations and might make the candidate for pulmonary rehab. But sometimes after we maximize their inhalers, if they still have symptoms that will be the next step to think about and then hopefully to prevent any exacerbations. Compared to patients if we maximize their medication, but their symptoms are fine, they probably don't benefit from rehab."
"Okay. So late in the exacerbations, eosinophil counts. Now how eosinophil counts, not very typical for COPD, but there's occasionally overlap with asthma. Sometimes it's hard to tell what the patients have, whether asthma or COPD. Sometimes we can make the distinctions, but sometimes we can't. So I wonder if they have high eosinophil count, so they have more, like asthma than COPD. So they might benefit from ICS."
"I would say it's seven because this is something we don't check quite routinely in COPD. We do it more for asthma patient, check their eosinophil counts."
"I would say seven because it's not something I screen routinely. If I have a clear COPD patients, I'm sure they have CBC, things like that, but sometimes I might not check it myself because I'm more, this a COPD. So I don't have to worry about eosinophils. Because there might be some situations when we have, my COPD patients who does not require ICS, but if they have high eosinophils and if this is proven to be fact that it increases the exacerbations, I might prescribe ICS for them, even if they have mild and things like that."
"So I think it's going to change how I approach it especially the mild patients, because moderate to severe, they're probably going to be on ICS anyway. But I wonder if there's some mild COPD patients who are not on ICS, but they might have high eosinophil counts, which probably got overlooked. I would say, I would take a look at their labs, the last six months, did they have any eosinophil counts? Something like that so I would give it seven."
"Yeah, I'm looking here. If they can have a clear cut for when they say high eosinophils, how high?"
"Graph, they put it in, but it's not very clear when they talk about it's high. Is it 150? Is it 200? Things like that. Because for asthma, we start to consider it high if it's more than 150."
"Between norm, low and high versus very high, because we have more guidelines for asthma, but I don't know about COPD."
I understand the first message. The stepwise treatment approach may allow for disease progression and long term damage.
"May allow for disease progression and long term damage, I don't know. Stepwise treatment. Because I'm  inaudible 00:53:36 . Stepwise treatment, that means that we started with LAMA/LABA, ICS, things like that. So that should slow the disease progression and should not allow it to happen. So I don't know if they put the wrong message or if I understand it wrongly, it doesn't seem-"
"May delay the disease   00:54:03  Prevent long term damage. I think they have it mixed up. This is what I think by reading. But the other one on the right, they have the right message. Delaying maintenance therapy is associated with increased risk. They put 68% moderate to severe, 79% for severe."
"I don't know. It looks like they put severe in both numbers. So that make it also a little confusing, although I don't-"
" inaudible 00:55:24  It's associated with worse outcome, this is what I get from reading the message."
"I think it's relevant if they can and fix the message or make it clearer. I would say six. Not the way they phrase. I think, sounds to me like they got it wrong, they got the message wrong."
I would say two. The way that I understood it.
I would say one because we definitely want to start aggressive treatment as soon as possible.
Try to prevent exacerbations and try to maintain the lung functions as long as possible. I'm not sure what they meant with phenotype patient to COPD.
"I mean, it's fine, the smoking cessation, the rehab and then the pharmacological agents."
I would say one because this is what we do usually.
"I mean, if they can talk about oxygen or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for some patients, especially for moderate to severe, things like that. Because there are also some other treatment options that are also some surgical... I know those are the most common ones, but there are also some other things, especially if they want oxygen, because oxygen might improve mortality in COPD and sometimes the noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, something like BiPAP, things like that. And then I add that-"
"Exacerbations, I would say, are a big back step or step backward for patients with COPD definitely because loss lung function, increased risk of future exacerbations, mortality, things like that. So this should be one of the main goal for any treating physician with COPD is try to prevent exacerbations as soon as possible. And sometimes I would say that we just encourage patients to call early if they have an exacerbation or worsening symptoms. Because sometimes if they think they are certain, if they call right away, they can get steroids, antibiotic. So at least we can prevent hospital admissions because that could be a factor in increasing mortality."
"If you have somebody with mild exacerbation just treat it at home with steroids, that's definitely better than somebody end up in the hospital for COPD. Preventing exacerbations or even early treatments, encourage patient to talk right away, seen right away. And hopefully they can stay at home preventing hospital admissions. Otherwise there's definitely loss of lung function, mortality, exacerbations, cardiovascular risk, everything they talk about."
"I would say emphasize the fact that we know; smoking, compliance with medications, early recognition, things like that. One thing new from those slides is the eosinophil, because it's not something I check routinely in patients with COPD should. And if there is benefits for ICS for those patients, even though if they're mild, then they don't have any exacerbations. So try to maximize treatments in order to prevent exacerbations   01:00:59  so important, especially for symptomatic patient."
Okay. Just went quickly through the numbers.
"It's better than the dual therapy, whether it's a LAMA/LABA or the LABA/ICS in terms of exacerbations, mortality, hospital admissions, things like that. And I think that   01:03:49  dual therapy, I would say."
"The data is definitely compelling, but the question is when you look at the product X, is it triple therapy, or this is just another dual therapy. Because if it's a triple therapy, this is something expected. If we add a triple therapy compared to dual therapy, especially because when they look at the eosinophil counts, I think they compare it only to LAMA/LABA. They didn't compare it to the LABA/ICS. Something come to my mind, is this a triple therapy which has ICS. In addition to the LAMA/LABA, is this another triple therapy? I would say the data is compelling, looks better than other dual therapy, but if you're looking at another triple therapy agents, is it better than the current ones? Can they compare it to the current triple therapy?"
"It sounds like, if I remember, the moderate to severe patient to COPD or those who are having exacerbations."
It's reducing mortality because I think mortality was lower for product X compared to the other dual therapy.
"It fits the definition of a triple therapy. So if patients are on dual therapy, but they are still somatics or they have exacerbations. I would say probably this is a step up compared to the dual therapy or if patients they have the high eosinophil counts, even if they are mild with no exacerbations. I would say, I think this is what they will... I would use this product. I don't know if can I use it as an initial therapy for patients who just have a mild COPD with no exacerbations. I don't know if can I use this drug. Looks like one of those step up treatments, patients who fail the dual therapy, whether they have exacerbations or they have symptoms or if they have high eosinophil counts. So I'd probably use that."
"I would say probably the mortality and reducing future exacerbations. That's probably the main risk. I don't know if it's going to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease or other comorbidities. Probably it's going to improve the symptoms as well. I think probably reducing exacerbation, reducing mortality."
"I would say probably one of the important one is slide B, the permanent loss of the lung function. I mean   01:08:41  but exacerbation is a problem even after patients are discharged and they're home because there is definitely permanent loss of lung function. So we definitely want to prevent exacerbations. So it's-"
"I would say C also. We know definitely there is many exacerbations going to affect the patient's symptoms, quality of life, mortality. So I would say C as well."
"Yeah. B, I won't put it, I mean, talk about risk factors, things like that. I don't think there's something new and I'm not sure about this mortality for different countries, I would say."
Okay. Definitely want to keep F. There's definitely increased hospitalization and mortality for each exacerbation. So each exacerbation is going to increase the risk for future exacerbations and mortality.
"G, I don't know, it sounds, I would say no."
"Or the cardiovascular. H, let me see, what else, let me see I... If I have to pick one among the other three, probably I'll pick G."
"  01:10:44  the other risk factors, I would keep G, but H and I would say no."
"Okay. Now, K, definitely, I want to keep the risk factors for exacerbations."
"I would say, L and M also are important, like symptoms as well as history of exacerbations is going to increase.   01:11:42 . J, actually, yeah, I'll keep J because that clearly puts COPD as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. So make clinicians aware to consider also cardiovascular disease in patients with COPD rather just talk about COPD, I would say probably I'd go for all four."
"I'll keep N and P, but not O. I think O has the wrong, I think they have the wrong message."
"But eosinophils, yeah, I think that's interesting."
I probably I'll put D at the beginning because that's main concern for COPD. So just to be sure the first thing clinician will see.
"I would say no. I'll probably keep the rest of them in the same order, the F, G, J, K."
"I would concentrate definitely on the idea of exacerbations. It's a major risk factor for mortality, decreased quality of life because of the permanent loss of the lung functions, with every exacerbations. So we talk about, in risk factors for exacerbations, patients who have symptoms, smokers, patients with the previous exacerbations, those are risk factor for future exacerbations. So the whole idea is to try aggressive treatments, especially with patients with exacerbations, just try to prevent them or prevent further exacerbations like aggressive treatment. In terms of behavioral treatment, bronchodilators, lifestyle modification, things like that. And also link COPD to cardiovascular disease plus eosinophil counts. I think that's also important."
"Screen patients early in the disease because we screen asthma patients, any patient with asthma, first visit, we screen their eosinophil as well as IGE levels. I think we probably should do the same thing for COPD. And probably just eosinophil count, not the IGE, but at least have an idea if they have higher eosinophil counts, whether we can introduce ICS early."
"I would say the early preventing exacerbations, that would be the key message for COPD. We have to be as aggressive as possible in order to, preventing exacerbations rather than just concentrate on the treatments."
"I would say probably the first one. Make clinicians are aware that after patient get better  inaudible 01:16:14  probation, there's some permanent loss of the lung function."
"I would say, yeah, those are important. All three of them."
"Yeah. I would say I'll keep them, especially the eosinophil counts, things like that."
"If they can compare product X or Z to other triple therapy, because that's the first thing come to our mind is that the triple therapy being compared to a dual therapy, which could be   01:17:46  So I think that increased the credibility of the product if they're trying to promote the product. I think they have to compare it with current triple therapy, but it sounds like this is triple therapy being compared to dual therapy. I mean, this is my impression."
"Yeah, sure. I'm a pulmonology critical care attending. I work at a community hospital that is one of those hybrid hospitals so they have residents and even med students but they're still community, they're not academic."
My practice is a mix of inpatient and outpatient. I probably do about 60% outpatient and 40% inpatient.
"My group is, I think, 20 docs or something."
"Well, I have a pretty big outpatient practice so I solely manage a good number of COPD patients on my own. Then I see them when they're admitted to the hospital and other people's COPD patients in the ICU setting and on the floors."
"... obviously the mild is the lower end of my practice, the least of the number. If you look at the percentages, mild's going to be less because they're usually probably okay with their primary."
I'm just going to think this through out loud.
"I see about 15 patients in the office a day and I would say over half of them are COPD. At least eight a day, five days a week. That's 40. Then, say, if I did one inpatient a week, a month, sometimes it's two, I don't know, I'm probably seeing, let's say, the same. 40 times four, so maybe 160."
"I mean, if I meet someone who's mild then maybe I do nothing and I just check their spirometry, make the diagnosis and go from there. If I meet someone who's moderate or mild and symptomatic, then my go to inhaler used to be a LAMA. If they're moderate I usually just start right with a LAMA/LABA and then I go from there. Then, if they're still uncontrolled, using their short acting inhaler a lot, then I go to triple therapy. I really base my triple therapy specific decision on their insurance coverage. Anyway, I want them on all three medicines, the ICS/LABA/LAMA. Then, if they're still symptomatic, that's when I look at adding the other medicines like a long acting or more nebulized stuff, et cetera. Then, from there, if they're still symptomatic we start looking at things like, well, obviously pulmonary rehab, but lung volume reduction with valves versus transplant, that kind of thing."
"Yeah. I don't know the actual policy of my office. We get samples of products and we are allowed to speak with the reps, but I think my office often tells them we're too busy. Anyway, I talked to a rep, I actually just spoke with a rep and I find it helpful to speak with them because they usually tell me things I don't know and then I know what's covered by people's insurance."
"Well, the reps I just spoke to were showing me that they compared theirs to the other one and it looked better. They know the studies, maybe they even sponsor that, I don't know, that I haven't come across. I just met with the reps probably two weeks ago because they said they hadn't talked to me in a while and they were for one of these triple inhalers. They were showing me ... I didn't think that statistic was helpful. They compared it to other inhalers and how much better their product was in terms of exacerbation."
"Yeah. I think their message to me was, ""Do you know this inhaler is available? Are you familiar with how it works and how it's dosed? Here's why you should use it. If we compare it to other inhalers, this one showed that it was superior in decreased exacerbations."" That was the messages."
"No. I guess sometimes I'm curious about the delivery method, if patients can tolerate it, but I don't usually get feedback that they can't. Sometimes I'm hesitant for that, but no."
"I mean, it seems like the message is COPD is bad and you could have it."
"I didn't realize that over half of people are undiagnosed so that caught my attention. I didn't realize the statistic of 40% was so high that they were readmitted after exacerbation. I mean, I guess I knew it was likely high but I didn't realize it was that many. I didn't know it's the third leading cause of death."
"Yeah. I guess the one in 10 adults seemed, was the same message to me that over half of people ... well I guess they're undiagnosed so that's different. Yeah, no, I didn't know one in 10 people had COPD and I didn't know about the ER visits but I guess I don't think too hard about that. That one was less interesting to me, the ER one."
"No. I mean, I guess if you're just trying to catch people's eye maybe you'd highlight the word readmitted as well as the up to 40% of patients, but the rest of it seems ... I can see the rest of it seems appropriate. I like how they put trachea and lung cancers as number six because I was curious where they fitted in if COPD was the third leading cause."
"Oh, I feel like this is very relevant. I feel like we should put this in the waiting room."
"I mean, I guess ... Yeah, I guess there's two ways of looking at it. If patients are seeing a lung doctor maybe they're aware that by this point that their COPD is an issue, but maybe they don't know these statistics. It is relevant to my practice. I'd probably give it a five for relevance."
"Oh, yeah. I still think that it's quite relevant. Yeah. At least a five, yeah."
Oh yeah. I hope it's all right. It looks credible to me so I'd give that a five.
"Sure. I think that's a six. I mean, it definitely brings my attention to the significance of COPD and the exacerbations, the readmissions and the deaths, et cetera."
I didn't know that the deaths were so high in these other countries from COPD in addition to ours.
Yeah. I didn't know ... I don't understand. Is this increased likelihood of health related issues meaning of COPD related issues or just health related issues in general?
I think they're saying you have an increased risk of health related issues if you have these problems. I don't know if it directly relates to COPD.
"Oh, I see. It's the low socioeconomic status associated with that and that's why these countries are probably having a harder time with COPD. Okay. Well that took me a little while to figure out, but I get it now."
"I believe this data. I mean, I feel credibility is a five."
"No. I like how this is, the pictures that go above smoking, biomass fuel pollution, because I'm not sure I would've ... I knew smoking, obviously, but I'm not sure I would think of biomass fuel pollution off the top of my head when I'm thinking about COPD. In my office I probably get a little tunnel vision."
"No, otherwise I think it looks fine. I guess when you're saying they're going to compare it to local, you're saying maybe Pennsylvania to US or something or compared to something local?"
"Yeah. I mean, this is talking more about how exacerbations are bad for you, can be bad for you and you might not even know you're having them or you're not telling anyone you're having them which I agree with. I like the SPIROMICS versus UPLIFT versus ECLIPSE. I think it's nice to have that data and refer to those trials."
The only thing I'm not sure I agree with is where it says decreased lung function leads to decreased physical activity which leads to decreased mental health which leads to decreased quality of life. I feel like decreased lung function leads to both decreased physical activity and decrease in mental health and then together those lead to decreased quality of life.
"I can see the thought process, but I guess I'm not sure everyone has that same cycle. I don't know."
I didn't realize that so many COPD patients are not even reported.
I don't really know what those people are doing though. I guess is that supposed to show 78% of people?
It took me a little while to figure out what that is. I feel like that would be better without the people and just that statistic even just printed bigger by itself.
"Oh, this is very relevant to my practice. I mean, this is what I'm trying to prevent. Relevance, I guess I would give it a six."
The only thing that makes me a little nervous with the credibility is this 50 to 78% because it's such a wide number.
I guess you do have sources there. Maybe I'd give it a five.
"I'd say the same thing like I said about ... sorry, the same thing like I said about lung function going to physical activity to mental health, I'm not sure that's the right flow. Sorry."
"Oh, I like that FEV1 picture there. That's really nice on the left."
"Oh, yeah. These are nice pictures. Yeah. I think this is great because I often tell patients this but I'm not sure that they've ever visually seen what it can do so this is helpful."
"I don't really, I wasn't reading that small print at the bottom but I'm guessing someone feels it's needed. To me it's just a distraction, but I think that my eyes obviously went to the two figures which is where I think the eye would like to see."
It looks pretty credible. I see they're referencing a COPD gene so I'd give it a six.
Oh wow. Yeah. It's interesting. I didn't realize risk of death was up 80% after two exacerbations in one year. That's probably something that I should be telling my patients.
"Within five years? Yeah, same thing. I think it's ... I mean, the message here is very clear that you're at increased risk of hospitalization, increased risk of death."
"I think that's important to remember. I mean, I think it's something that we all know but we don't necessarily, you're just in the habit of treating these exacerbations without educating your patients and their families."
I think this is nice to see it written out and have these easy to grab statistics to repeat.
"Well, I'm not sure, if I look at this graph on the left it says probability of surviving, I'm not sure if that's in years or months or just one is very probable over time I guess. Oh, I see. Okay."
"Yeah, I see. Okay. Over 60 months your chances of survival if you have more exacerbations. Yeah. That's okay. I think the statistics for that at the top are a little more helpful than following that graph."
"Yeah, I think it's quite relevant to my practice. I mean, I'd give it a six."
It looks pretty credible. I'd give that a six.
"Yeah, this is nice. I mean, again, this is something that I know but I don't think I knew the statistics for. Twice the increased risk of an MI, that's well shown there. I like that bar graph. Increased risk of stroke, 40%. I see. One to five days versus six to 10 days. Purple is MI and blue is stroke. Oh, I see. It's a little weird because those go in opposite directions. The red comes down. Really with the red you're showing there's a two times increased risk of MI over 10 days. Same thing I guess with stroke, but then why are we ... I'm not sure why they would divide it into one to five and six to 10, you should probably just make it one to 10 and show COPD versus a non-COPD. I'm not really sure. I was comparing these thinking oh, it's getting worse, it was pre-exacerbation to post, but it's not, it's just showing one to five versus six to 10 days. I'm not sure that is mapping out the way they were hoping."
"Yeah. I mean, why, right? The risk is high. I mean, the take home, it sounds like, is you have a two times increased risk of MI in the first, whatever, one to five days. I feel like that's the statistic that's important. I guess I can see that it's not quite twice if you go out 10 days. Maybe they can represent that differently. I don't know, that's just my opinion. Otherwise it takes me a little while to figure out exactly what they're showing with these bars."
"Yeah, I mean, the next part is nice. The risk persists for up to a year, so four times the risk in the first 30 days and 90% for up to a year. That's really nice. I think that's well done there. It even tells you what they mean by CV events. I think that's definitely stuff that I would quote my patients on. I like how it's easy to read and easy to interpret."
"Yeah. Just, I mean, I know that, in my head I know that, okay, COPD exacerbations increase your risk of CV events, but I could never say to myself but how significant is that? Now I look at this and I'm like, ""Wow, I didn't realize it's four times the risk. That's huge. Up to 90% for up to a year."" It really shows you that this is a big deal."
"Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry, I couldn't hear the second part. It's relevance and then it's credibility?"
This looks credible. I'm not quite following that first graph. I'm going to give that a four on credibility.
"Then motivation for me, it's very motivating. A six."
"Yeah, this is nice. I mean, I don't think I realized the increased mortality with just these other well known comorbidities and how it affects the quality of life. Yeah, that's nice."
"No, I think that looks pretty good. I mean, I can ... I like this, how they did these pictures on the right here. Yeah, no, I think that this is fine."
"I guess the only thing I'm not sure of, and maybe that's just because I'm being picky, the last slide talked about cardiovascular disease and then this one does as well and this is saying at the top that it's increasing your risk of death but then these two statistics on the left are not actually about your increasing risk of death. I'm not sure if they should be their own thing. I don't know. I can see why they're putting them here but I'm just not sure if it takes away from the focus on the mortality which is on the right side of the screen."
"Yeah, sure. It's quite relevant. Yeah, I'd give it a six for relevance."
"Yeah, no, looks credible. I'd give that a six as well."
"How does it make me think differently? Yeah, I'd give it a six."
"I'm not sure how helpful that is to know that patients with moderate disease are more likely to die from cardiovascular conditions than severe disease, I guess because severe diseases are just dying from the COPD itself. Yeah, I see that. I'm just not sure how, I guess, the relevance, that's probably less relevant for me. They're still dying, you know?"
"Yeah, I can see where they're going with this."
"Yeah, I think that's fine. I mean, I'm not sure the people that they're coloring in. I guess that's the 39%. I feel like you probably don't need that, you just need the statistic there. These people are a distraction for me. If anything they make me think it's something that's the opposite of what they're trying to say. Four people are colored and maybe I would think, oh, the other people are doing fine. I don't know. I feel like that's confusing. The rest still looks good."
"Yeah. I mean, I think this one's a little bit less relevant to me so I'd give it a four."
I mean it looks credible. I see all these studies there so I'd give that a six.
Probably a little bit less so. I'd give that a four.
"Yeah. Oh, that's fine. I can see ... I mean, this is definitely nice for a physician to see and think about the physiology of things. Assuming that this is credible, I think it's nice. I only say that because I think of COPD as more just causing circulation, the smoking causing hardening of the vessels, but I guess yeah, no, no, no, I think this is fine."
"No. I think it's good. I like how it brings them together, both the cardiovascular side and then brings them to the same end point. No, I think this is good."
"Oh, it's very relevant. I'd give it a six."
Think differently about COPD? Yeah. Maybe five.
Yeah. This is good. Very straightforward and to the point.
"I didn't know about the eosinophils with COPD. I feel like that's something that's not yet well known or maybe I just haven't heard as much about it. I mean, I know about it in asthma. The only thing I would say about this slide is it looks like one leads to the other leads to the other and I guess I'm not sure if that's true or if these are three separate things that are all risks for exacerbation. I'm not sure that the presentation with those arrows looping one to the next to the next makes sense to me."
It looks like one leads to one leads to one and I'm not sure if that's true.
It's definitely relevant. I'd give it a six.
"Yeah. I mean, definitely a six because that eosinophil is going to grab my attention there."
"I guess the question is, when we say motivating me to think differently, it's as if I'm taking this slide by itself, not comparing it to the previous before it?"
"Sorry, it's taking me a little while looking at this left figure to figure out what we're talking about. It's patients with COPD who had zero exacerbations, moderate exacerbation frequency. Oh, I see. Zero."
"Yeah. Then greatest risk of future exacerbations are those who have a previous history of exacerbation. Patients here on the X had history of exacerbation and we're comparing it to patients with COPD. If you had more than two exacerbations you probably had COPD, right? I mean, that is really hard for me to understand what they're showing with that figure on the left."
"I see blue is one or more compared to none, exacerbation frequency. Then how many had a frequency at the 12 month follow-up of more than two? I see. If you had one or more exacerbations then you had more than two exacerbations and you probably had COPD. That's really hard to understand-"
"... that graph. Maybe if someone was walking me through it I would get it, but it's not self-explanatory and, to be honest, I've had to look at the Y, the X, the Y, the top so many times that I just think whatever, move on. I don't think that's effective."
"Okay. The right hand side I think is great. It's very self-explanatory, it's relevant and it's important. It shows that, once you have an exacerbation, you might just head down this path."
"I'm going to have to account for this one on the left. I mean, if I focus on the one on the right it's very relevant. I'd give it a six."
A seven. I think that's very motivating that one.
Yeah. Yeah. I think this is very ... I think this is good. It's very clear to me.
"Well, it's a little bit of the same where I'm not ... it's that same X/Y axis as the previous one. I get it, your mMRC goes up so you have increased risk of exacerbation which I feel like should be what the blue is showing, but instead when you look to the left the blue is showing how many of those people had COPD."
"The blue is just showing one or more and then, the higher the blue is, it means a little bit more than one. I guess I'm not sure of the number value."
"If you're saying yes, it increases the risk of exacerbation, you can't really say by what statistic. I don't understand what that is. Do you know what I'm saying?"
"Yeah. I mean, I guess I would've assumed all of these patients had COPD because we're talking about what's their mMRC score. We usually just do that in our COPD patients. I guess this is the same on the previous slide, the Y axis is what I think has to be changed."
"No, it looks credible. I looked at mMRCs there, I mean, if the graph was different I'd give that a five."
Increased mMRC with increased risk of exacerbation. Maybe a five.
This is the eosinophil thing that I wasn't sure of.
"Increasing your eosinophil count is increasing your exacerbation without an ICS. Yeah. I think this is interesting information. This is what I count on, I find helpful from reps, this kind of stuff in particular where it's a newer take on COPD management."
"Yeah, exactly. No, this slide looks good. I understand the graph and the right just talks about it more. I think it's good."
"It looks credible. I mean, you have the study right there with the graph so I'd give it a six."
"Oh, that's a seven. I mean, that's what I'm saying. This is far different than usual."
"Treatment escalation and lack of treatment. Oh, I see. This is saying don't do stepwise, why you shouldn't do stepwise. People get-"
"... accelerated lung function decline. Gotcha. Okay. Well, I mean, if that's true then that is well illustrated."
"Well, I guess the only thing is, I guess on the right they're saying this is patients who were not on maintenance therapy to begin with when we're saying delaying maintenance therapy. Is it delaying the initiation of maintenance therapy after a severe exacerbation?"
"The initiation? Then yeah, they'd probably have to include that because I wasn't sure if it means if you don't tell someone to start their LAMA a week after they're out of the hospital or as soon as they get home or if you're saying if they've never been on it and they have an exacerbation then it's the initiation that, if you delay, causes the risk."
I don't know. I need that information to know how to interpret those statistics.
"Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. It's just saying that, if they don't start their maintenance medicine as soon as their exacerbation's done, then they're at risk of doing worse. I can see that then. Maybe I was reading too hard into it."
"Well it's very relevant, especially the stepwise thing. I'd definitely give it a six."
"It looks credible. I'm curious about the data from the left hand slide which I have a haven't seen, but no, yeah, looks like a six."
"Oh, well that's a seven because that changes everything with the stepwise therapy."
"This seems like a nice slide. It has nice, important points. I mean, I don't think it's anything I didn't know, but yeah, I think it's easy to read and easy to follow and makes sense."
"Yeah. I like the statistics there so it makes it look credible. Same thing, six."
I don't think it really changes my thoughts about COPD. I feel like these are things I already knew and do so I'd give it a four.
"Yeah. I think the takeaway is that COPD is a severe disease that causes significant health issues with increased risk of death. That was really the focus of the slides and then there was the few at the end about treatment. I mean, treatment is important I guess. Treatment. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's the focus of the slides, really on the health effects of COPD and why it's so terrible and the exacerbations."
"I think it makes me realize the long term effects of COPD exacerbations, cardiovascular risk, decreased FEV1, decreased quality of life. You're asking me, sorry, how is it relevant?"
"Yeah, it makes me think of my COPD patients, and because I see so many maybe I lose this message, as very sick patients at risk of very bad health in their future even though when I see them in the office maybe they're seemingly doing okay. It makes me think of them, recognize them more as they're sick and their chance of death and their chance of having hospitalization is high. I should think of them in that way and make sure that, when I'm treating them, that's how I'm treating them, as a sick person who's at risk of being sicker at any minute."
"How compelling? Yeah, I mean, I guess there's going to be a part of you that thinks, right, I know COPD's bad for patients, you don't have to show me these statistics, but I find the slides helpful because the statistics are very in your face so they're very much here's how bad it is. It is compelling. It's definitely compelling if someone ... yeah, I think it is because it shows you these very clear statistics."
"Well, what was interesting to me is that it's far better than a LABA/LAMA and in some instances it was better than ICS/LABA but at some points they were the same which is just not typical of how I think of COPD management so that was interesting. The blood eosinophil count, how it seemed more helpful with blood eosinophil count than LABA/LAMA was also interesting to me. I mean, those are obviously going to be a certain subset of patients where it seems like it would be more helpful."
"I mean, it seems like it's moderate to severe COPD, this would be better than even a LABA/LAMA or an ICS/LABA. The mortality was less, I think it said exacerbations was less, but then also, if you look at the LABA/LAMA in patients with high blood eosinophil levels, it's definitely better than a LABA/LAMA."
"Well, interestingly, like I said at the beginning, I used to start with a LAMA but I always start now with the LABA/LAMA for my moderate patients. It's almost saying I should just start with product X because this is saying it's better than a LABA/LAMA"
It would be earlier in my treatment algorithm.
"Well, I saw that slide ... are we allowed to go back to these slides or it was a once and done look?"
"Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean, I think it's going to fit in with ... I mean, talking about causes of mortality, cardiovascular disease, it's going to fit in with that which was highlighted in the beginning here, how COPD causes bad cardiovascular disease and it's going to fit in with the other things, exacerbations, et cetera. I think product X is going to fit in because that's where we usually use a LABA/LAMA, but it seems like maybe there's going to be a role for this."
"I just want to clarify, we're doing a compelling story that affects doctors to show them COPD is important to treat, is that my story?"
I'm telling you a concise story to think differently about COPD so I think I would keep the first slide.
"I'd probably eliminate the second slide, the burden of COPD."
Just because I'm not sure that it helps with my concise story.
"This is not a follow-up story, is that right? This is as if I was starting new or would this go after my first, those other three?"
"Okay, so we're putting them all together."
"Well, this is a little tricky because I don't really like that one graph."
"It's hard for me to put it on my story. This one that we had talked about. Well, I mean, it's okay. One to five days versus six to 10 days, I don't know, I think that's a little ..."
"Okay. If I'm telling you a concise story that makes you think differently about COPD I want you to know ... I probably want you to know the risk of hospitalization and death, F, the right side of G which is that it goes beyond the lungs and then H and I would eliminate I."
I just want to verify it starts at the top left and then it goes until the pink page?
"Okay. I would probably at least switch ... I can't see the letters at the top anymore, but the third slide here with the exacerbation affecting FEV1, I'd probably put this one next to it, in front of it, increasing the risk of hospitalization and death and then show how it changes the function of the lungs."
"Oh, it would be the fourth slide and the fourth slide now would be the third slide."
"I can't remember what this number 10 slide says, frequent exacerbations?"
"Oh, I see. No, no, that was the one. No, no, you got it. Sorry. Okay. Let me just look one more time."
Can you slide up just a tad? Okay. I think I would move slide seven and put it before slide four. Yeah. That's how I would tell my story.
"The story is COPD is a major worldwide health problem and patients with COPD who exacerbate are sick and at risk, at increased risk of recurrent exacerbations and death. Those exacerbations can decrease their overall lung function each time they occur. With that, it affects other organ systems including cardiovascular so there's increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with COPD. When we're thinking about managing them, we need to think about inhaler therapy, their eosinophil level and if there's targeted therapies that are available. I think that's what I would say."
"Specialty is family practice, private practice in upper Manhattan, lower socioeconomic group, primarily African American and Hispanic, a hybrid between private practice and urgent medical care."
"I'm sorry. We got disconnected. I don't know whose fault it was, but if it was our fault, I'm sorry. "
"Well, first is to make the diagnosis. Sometimes it's not that easy, because they may have asthma or they may have ACOS, which is a combination of the two. Taking a very detailed history, especially of cigarette smoking, and the number of years, and how many backs per day. Then, doing a detailed physical examination, looking for signs of COPD, listening to the lungs and other stigma on the body, and then performing the pulmonary function studies to confirm the diagnosis of COPD, and also to help me stage in what stage of COPD the patient is. Then, based upon their stage, determining what would be the best treatment for them."
"I'd say 90% of treatment naive patients that come to my office that have never been treated, I manage on my own. Once in a while, I get referred from a pulmonologist who's been treating them and they don't have a primary doctor for all their other problems. Those patients, I will co-treat with the referring pulmonologist. But by and large, where I'm situated and the porosity of pulmonologists, I'm kind of forced to be the only one to treat them."
"Going through the spectrum from mild to moderate, to severe, to very severe, in some cases I'll only prescribe them rescue therapy, like a rescue inhaler, like a Ventolin or Albuterol, that they can carry around with them and use it when they feel that they're short of breath. That's a very small percentage. The next step in the algorithm is to add a LAMA. A LAMA can be a long-acting medication, or it could be a short-acting anti-muscarinic. Then if that doesn't fail or the patient progresses, the next step is usually to combine a LABA and a LAMA. Then finally, it's triple therapy, which is LABA, LAMA, ICS.   00:08:15 -"
"Somebody who is moderate to severe, to very severe, where their PFTs have deteriorated, their symptomatology has increased. Usually, they've had at least two exacerbations in the last year, or they've had one exacerbation that resulted in hospitalization. And also, based upon the questionnaires that we give them, like the ACT, and other, I forget the acronyms, but they are two or three questionnaires that they fill out and we score them. When we see that their score increase, that's a sign that their disease is progressing and they need to step up the treatment with something else."
"I think it's wonderful, because in terms of compliance, it's so much easier to have all three medications within one inhaler. Typically, they only have to take one puff per day. It also makes them feel less nervous. Because when they're using three different pumps, it tells them that they're extremely sick, and it also puts fears in their head that the more pumps they use the greater the likelihood that they'll experience an adverse reaction. Compliance is a huge factor in treatment, especially when they're on multiple different inhalers. They forget if they took this one or the other one, did they take it once or twice? To be able to eliminate all of that, those issues about compliance, that itself, gives them a big advantage in terms of getting the best possible treatment. It eliminates any doubt or confusion and the patients really like it. "
"They talk about a reduction and the number of acute exacerbations. Somebody who has an acute disaster and has to go to the emergency room, statistically, they're three times more likely to die than someone with a heart attack. A COPD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, I think it's about 400,000 people. Your ultimate goal is to try to minimize or completely eliminate any acute exacerbations."
"They always show data, with triple therapy, how the number of exacerbations goes down in comparison to dual therapy. "
"All patients are afraid of steroids. When you mention that word, they all get nervous, especially if they have to be on it for a long period of time. They all have these preconceived notions that it's a terrible medication. Sometimes there's a little resistance to being on the ICS component of triple therapy for a longer period of time. Sometimes patients will say, ""Oh, when I'm really doing bad, I don't mind taking it, but if I'm feeling really good, I would prefer to be on a just dual therapy and maybe add on a short burst of either oral or inhaled steroids when I really need them. That way, I can avoid some of the dreaded complications of being on steroids long-term."""
"Okay. I think the major purpose of this slide is to highlight to everybody how serious the problem COPD is, both in the United States and worldwide, and to try to get across the message that COPD has to be taken very seriously, similar to when somebody has a heart disease or has had a heart attack."
"Well, the part about half of them being undiagnosed, I wasn't aware of that. I know that it is a large number and that's not because we're bad physicians, but because people with COPD, they avoid going to the doctor. Most cases, they're dragged to the office by a family member, because they're aware that the doctor is going to advise them to stop smoking. Smoking is one of the hardest addictions to get rid of, even more than heroin, and they don't want to put themselves in a situation where they'll have to give up their smoking. So they tend to minimize their symptomatology, or to say, ""Oh, it's only a smoker's cough."" They're kind of working against you in terms of coming to the office, so that they can be diagnosed."
"Yeah. I wasn't aware that it was that high, over 50%. Also, some patients are in the mild stages, where they wouldn't really think that they have a disease. I'm a little short of breath, I'm getting older, and they attribute it just to getting older. They don't even know or want to see the doctor about it. "
"Yeah, well, that's common knowledge. We always say the greatest risk of being admitted, having an exacerbation is having had a previous exacerbation within the last three months, which is why it's so important to make sure they're treated properly. Not only that, but to follow them very closely after they're discharged."
"Even though I treat a lot of COPD patients, it's always good to step back and see if maybe I should be more aggressive in my treatment at an earlier stage in disease. There's been some literature saying that we should treat more aggressively in the earlier stages of disease to prevent the patient from progressing from mild to severe, and just really recognizing COPD at its earliest stages. "
"Well, as I mentioned before, the third leading cause of death, that's something that bells should go off in your head or light bulbs every time you see a COPD patient, knowing that the mortality rate is so high. Obviously, if you treat a large number of patients, you can expect statistically that you're going to have some patients who don't make it until the end of the year, which is even a more compelling reason to try to treat them as aggressively as you possibly can. Then, the other point is about 10%, 10% globally, have COPD, that's one out of 10 patients. It makes you more likely, when you talk to a new patient, to proactively ask questions pertaining to COPD, especially if they're older, even if normally you wouldn't suspect that they have COPD, because it's so common and so frequent."
"It's a little difficult to read, but I think I can make it out."
"Well, practicing in the United States, it shows that we have a very high mortality rate compared to other nations for COPD, which is another reason why we should really be focused on looking for COPD and aggressively treating it. It also differentiates based upon their socioeconomic status, which is another thing to take into consideration when you're treating a patient who does come from a lower socioeconomic status to kind of put them in a higher risk for diagnosing and treating COPD. Then, also in terms of risk factors; the sedentary lifestyle or the same risk factors that apply to cardiovascular disease also apply to COPD. In other words, if someone has comorbid conditions and COPD, you should be more aggressive in your approach to treating the COPD, because of the comorbid conditions. "
"I'm not so sure about the significance of worldwide COPD deaths. I understand that it's dealing with, in the United States, it's important to demonstrate that we have a high rate of deaths from COPD. I don't really know how to interpret that. Maybe because we're much better at diagnosing and treating COPD, whereas in other countries, if they don't know what it is, or they don't treat it and the patient dies, they may not even know that the patient died from COPD. It skews the data, because logically, you would think in a highly industrialized Western country, like the United States, that we should have a low rate of death from COPD, so maybe it's because we are very good at diagnosis and treating it."
"Unfortunately, people are going to die even in the best type of treatment, so that the data may be somewhat skewed, because of other factors. But nevertheless, I think it's important to point out. The other reason, I think, we're having such a high mortality rate is because a lot of the patients with COPD don't have the same access to medical care, and they're not really knowledgeable about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking. They don't have access to smoking cessation programs, and they also have a much higher rate of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, heart attacks, which has a negative bearing on the COPD."
"I would say seven. I mean, I practice in the United States and the United States is one of the highest countries."
"I'd give it a six, because, as I stated previously, I'm not really sure why we have such a high rate when we have the best available treatments. I think there are other confounding variables that perhaps give us a worse reputation than we deserve. "
"That the number of exacerbations is high and that a very high percentage of exacerbations are not even reported, which makes our job that much more difficult. When someone does have an exacerbation, there are many factors involved besides just having an inability to breathe properly. "
"I think it does the job, because it highlights how frequent exacerbations are. That's not something that happens to one out of 10 people in five years, it's a very high number. It also makes us really take a better history and try to find out about exacerbations that have happened to our patients that we don't even know about. Because finding out about those exacerbations, can help us in our treatment and treating more aggressively in patients who have had exacerbations that we don't even know about. "
"Then, also, to make us think about what an exacerbation does to a person. It's not only limited to their lungs. It's so limited to their head, their quality of life, their ability to do things that they like to do. Exercising, walking around, worrying about future exacerbations, worried about curtailing in their longevity, because of the exacerbation. It's not just, ""Oh, I have difficulty breathing once every three months that prompts me to go to my doctor or to the ER."" It's a lot more complicated than that. "
"The part about that up to 80% of people who have had exacerbations, we don't even know about it. I wasn't aware it was that high. It's a little bit scary and it would prompt me to really question my patients more thoroughly, to make sure that they didn't have an exacerbation and didn't, or they had an exacerbation and didn't tell me about it."
"Yeah. It's kind of like what I alluded to previously, that there's a school of thought that says to treat patients, even in the mild to moderate stages, very aggressively or more aggressively than we're treating now, in order to prevent exacerbations. It's not like an asthma attack, where you have a short while where you can't breathe and then you breathe normally again. Every time you get an exacerbation, it causes irreversible damage to the lungs. "
"The more exacerbations, it's like a vicious, vicious spiral, where the more exacerbations they have, the worse their residual lung function is and the greater likelihood that they'll have another exacerbation. It's not just, ""Oh, they were sick and now they're feeling better again, and everything is back to status quo."" It's not like that, they keep on getting worse and worse. That gives credence to the school of thought about treating patients more aggressively, even when they're in their earlier stages to prevent these exacerbations."
"It's pretty straightforward. It shows you on the left that before the exacerbation, their FEV was a certain level. After the exacerbation, even when they felt better, it was at a lower level. That conveys the message that they don't get better after exacerbation. And on the right, it shows us also that exacerbation leads to reduced lung function."
"No. In this format it's new to me, but the concept about losing lung function when you have an exacerbation is something that that knowledge has been around for some time."
"The knowledge that I think many clinicians are still not aware of that every time they get an exacerbation, they're not going to be as good as they used to be, which gives, or makes you highly motivated in preventing any acute exacerbations. "
It's a downward spiral. It's a downward spiral.
"We touched that before, in terms of acknowledging the severity of COPD and exacerbations, that someone with an acute exacerbation of COPD is three times more likely to die than someone who comes to the emergency room with a heart attack. And people have a tendency not to put, if you say, ""Well, what would you have would rather have, a exacerbation of COPD of a heart attack?"" Most people would say COPD, but it's not really, that's not really the case."
"I think the 80%, the risk of death with two exacerbations in one year, it's a very high number. As I stated previously, is about 400,000 deaths per year. It's a pretty scary number. But 80% risk of death, that's really very sobering and probably enough to motivate patients to really optimize their treatments and to seek out medical attention whenever they feel like their respiratory function is declining. Not to wait until the last minute, but to get in contact with their physician when they first start to notice that their deteriorating. "
"Not to me, but I think they should be reiterated and they should be taught to people who aren't aware that you're dealing with a deadly disease. These numbers are comparable to someone with cancer, so it should be in certain respects, treated with the same reverence and fear as if you were treating a patient with lung cancer or any other type of cancer. Patients should have the same respect and fear for COPD as they do to a diagnosis of a heart attack or to cancer."
"Yeah, only because I believe it and I know it to be true, but I think maybe some clinicians who looked at it would think that it's exaggerated based on their own experiences."
"It looks higher than one would take think that it should be, but I know that it's true, but I would anticipate that some clinicians would look at it and they would say, ""Nah, it's not as bad as they... They only want to make it seem worse, because they want you to use their products."""
"Okay. This is what we alluded to before, about the comorbid conditions. Usually, people with COPD, they have risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This kind of puts the connection, ties the two together, and lets you know that if you have COPD, we're not just worried about your lungs, we're worried about your heart and we're worried about your brain, and there's a very serious risk of doing damage to your heart and your brain, if you're an uncontrolled COPD person."
"Yeah. The 90% increase for up to a year. Always impressed with very high numbers and I wouldn't really think it would be that high, but I'm not doubting it. Four times the risk in the first month is also more than I would've guessed it to be."
"Yeah. Very impressive. Especially in such a short timeframe and doubling the risk, it's knowledge that I think every COPDer should be equipped with, to impress upon them the importance of taking the best possible care that they can of their COPD. Not for the sake of their lungs, but also for the sake of their heart and their brain."
"Six, for the same reason as before? And seven for the last one."
"Okay. This is looking at it from the different angle, from the opposite standpoint. That people who have cardiovascular problems are much more likely to die from their COPD. Before, we looked at COPD having an infect and cardiovascular. Now, we're looking from the other standpoint. They're very much interconnected, the lungs get the oxygen to the heart and the brain. When you don't have enough oxygen coming into your brain in your heart, obviously the risk of damage naturally is going to increase. It's a logical progression, but I think it needs to be pointed out to underline and stress the importance that if you do have both conditions, or if you do have COPD, that you have a much greater likelihood of developing cardiovascular problems. "
"No, nothing really. I think it does a pretty good job at relaying the information. Yeah. I would leave it alone."
"Okay. Again, it's a different approach to linking cardiovascular disease with COPD, to show how much they're really intertwined. That if you do have COPD, it increases your risk of dying of a cardiovascular disease, which is something that is logical, but maybe many COPD patients are not aware of it. It makes sense in terms of not getting enough oxygen into your blood, and the ramifications, and terms of the effects of hypoxemia on your heart and on your brain."
"No, I think it's, I think it's pretty, I mean, be interested to, there's a pretty big discrepancy in the studies on the left. It goes more than two and a half times from the lowest to the highest, so we'd want some clarification. I would've hoped to have seen greater symmetry or less of a span between the highest and the lowest, and find out why that was. But other than that, I think that's fine."
"The fact that if you have severe COPD, more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than if you have moderate COPD. It seems like the logical progression, but it's nice to see it in scale, so you can quantify what the difference is. It also is certainly incentivizing for people who have moderate COPD to prevent them from getting to severe COPD, to do everything possible in their power to prevent them from progressing with their COPD."
"I don't know if you necessarily need five different studies. I mean, the more the merrier, but there is a discrepancy between, the significant discrepancy, so that creates confusion in the minds of people who are looking at it and they tend to think, ""Well, maybe there was something faulty in this study that caused such a large discrepancy."" Maybe you don't need so many studies or maybe you need a disclaimer as to why one study was so much higher than the other one. "
"On the right side, everything looks good."
"Yeah. Okay. Well, this is similar to what we had discussed before about what's the connection between COPD and cardiovascular, and it seems like the common denominator is that with exacerbations of COPD, you're not getting enough oxygen. You don't get enough oxygen to the heart and the brain, and the heart tries to compensate by beating faster. That increases the likelihood of having a heart attack or having a stroke, because you're not getting enough oxygen to the brain and to the heart. From a pathophysiological standpoint, it makes absolute sense. Most people are aware of that connection, but maybe on a subconscious level, so it's a good idea to spell it out and reinforce that there is a direct connection between COPD and cardiovascular."
"I'll give it a six, only because it's common knowledge and I'm not so sure that this slide is really going to motivate me to treat my patients differently."
"Okay. This is like we spoke before about being aggressive with people earlier on in their disease and looking for the risk factors that may lead them to develop an exacerbation. The more knowledgeable you are about the risk factors, the greater the likelihood that you'll be looking for ways to aggressively prevent them from getting those exacerbations."
"Well, the last one about putting a patient on ICS, because ICS is a little bit controversial in COPD, but there is obviously an allergic component and that the patient has an allergic component and ICS is the most powerful anti-inflammatory. That would probably be a good idea in terms of minimizing their exacerbations. But I think it's more specific for asthma than it is for COPD, or maybe patients with overlap, ACOS patients."
"Give it a seven, because of the last bulletin, bullet point. "
"Again, we don't really associate eosinophils with COPD, it's more with asthma. "
"If it's really a COPD, we don't really focus on eosinophil, it's more people with allergies or with asthma. I'm not so sure if it really belongs here. I would say it should be with more on a topic of asthma or allergic rhinitis, where it's more relevant. Because when we think of COPD, we don't think right away of allergies, it's more asthmatic. "
"Yeah. We discussed this, that the highest risk factor for an exacerbation is a previous exacerbation and they happen pretty quickly after the first exacerbation, which is why you have to treat the patients extremely aggressively after they come out of the hospital with an exacerbation to prevent another one. Obviously the more exacerbations, the more lung damage and the greater the likelihood of them dying. I think it's important to emphasize this and to drive the message home, that you have to do everything to prevent exacerbations, but if unfortunately your patient does experience an exacerbation, you really have to follow them extremely aggressively to prevent them from a downward spiral."
"I think it's pretty straight forward, and the graphs get across the message that you have on top. I wouldn't make any changes to it."
"Okay. This one seems a little bit intuitive. I'm not really sure. If I had to delete one of the slides, this might be the one, because it seems like a no-brainer, even for patients, not physicians. Because if someone has increased breathlessness, it's logical that it's going to lead to an exacerbation and it has to be dealt with seriously and right away. And patients shouldn't wait, they should seek treatment right away. I'm not really sure that it's adding too much to the equation. We discussed about the MRC scoring, which is one of the parameters that we use to decide in what class they are and what medications they should be on."
So I'm not really sure this adds too much to the equation.
"Okay. This is similar to what we spoke about before with the eosinophil counts. Again, when you're dealing with COPD, it's not something on the top of your mind. It's more with patients with asthma, with allergic rhinitis. You don't really think of COPDers having, and I don't routinely check eosinophil counts on patients that have pure COPD. Maybe it's a good idea to check it anyway, in the event that they do have an allergic component, or maybe it's a more evidence that you're really dealing with a crossover, like an ACOS patient. But strictly speaking with COPD, I don't generally think of eosinophils as having primary importance in treating patients. I think it maybe more of a justification to give patients triple therapy and to mitigate their concerns about having to take an ICS, when it's been shown that LABA/LAMA is much better than LABA/ICS."
"Okay. I think they're advocating for more aggressive treatment early on, like we spoke earlier. That it may make sense to, as soon as you make the diagnosis, to treat it more aggressively, even though their symptoms, or their scores, or their PFTs are not at a severe level. That may make sense. With the natural history of disease that we know where it's going, it may make more sense to hit them with everything that you have in the beginning to prevent further progression of the disease."
"No, I was going to say that it's a topic that's coming up more frequently. Discussions about COPD, about shifting the treatment paradigm in favor of more aggressive treatment earlier on in the disease, and the pros and cons of doing that. I think it's a good slide to open up the discussion about talking about this topic. Some people feel that hitting your patients with everything you have at the beginning may not be the way to go and that you should just use it as the need progresses, but then there's another school of thought that says that, treat them very aggressively from the beginning to prevent them from progressing to the next stage. "
"Okay. This seems like a generalized approach for treating patients with COPD with the goal of reducing exacerbations and mortality. It's like COPD 101 on what you should do. I'm not sure if it's relevant for physicians who already have experience treating patients with COPD, but maybe it can be used in educating consumers or patients with COPD, or just a reiteration for physicians who already know this, that they should try harder to follow these guidelines. "
"I mean, it's laid out. The issue is not improving it. The issue is whether it's really necessary for physicians who routinely treat it. It's like when you look at slides, you're looking for new information. This doesn't necessarily give me anything that I didn't know about beforehand. May be a good opening slide or may be a good closing slide, just to remind all the different facets. It's not only about which inhaler you're going to use. It's also, there are non-pharmacological ways of helping the patient with COPD. Maybe that's the most important message, non-pharmacological means. "
"We have to recognize the frequency and the severity of COPD. We have to take it more seriously. We have to be much more aggressive in terms of the way we treat COPD. We have to make our patients aware of how serious the disease is. We have to focus on comorbid conditions, because they have an effect on each other in terms of the patient's prognosis. We have to figure out a way to bring patients to the office sooner to make the diagnosis of COPD. "
"Well, it's again, bringing up this debate about whether patients should be treated more aggressively at the outset of the disease or whether it should be like a progressive adding on a different therapies as the patient goes through the natural history of the disease. I think the jury is still out on that, and the future will resolve on whether which type of treatment is better for the patient. "
"Well, the good point is it seems, in comparison to LABA/LAMA, that it's a superior product, in terms of minimizing exacerbations, decreasing mortality rates, decreasing death to the cardiovascular disease, and patients with high eosinophil counts being superior to LABA/LAMA. The thing that I don't like about it is how did it compare to triple therapy? It sounds like it may just be another triple therapy or you could use the available existing triple therapies to replace Product X. Like you could write Trelegy or Breztri, and you could probably make the same statements about it. I don't necessarily see how it's differentiated from existing treatments. "
"I think it's excellent. I think it's very relevant, Product X, to all the slides that we showed. My only skepticism is that it didn't compare to the existing triple therapy. I was hopefully looking for a new product that would be equal or superior to the triple therapies that we already have available. I'm not really seeing that, so, it's really comparing just to LABA/LAMA. If you take triple therapy and compare it LABA/LAMA, obviously you're going to get a better result. I'm not really impressed. I'm not really impressed that Product X represents any clear cut advancement from what we already have. "
"Well, they seem to be focusing on the eosinophilic allergic IgE component patients. Obviously, in those types of patients, ICS would have a huge benefit, because it's the most potent anti-inflammatory. In that scenario, it makes sense, where our triple therapy would be beneficial to a double therapy, which doesn't really address allergic components. But as far as to what percentage of COPDers have high eosinophil counts, or have an allergic component, I'm not sure that number is a very high number. "
"I think I would probably treat it in the same category of people who require triple therapy. At this point, it would seem to me just to be a me too to the Trelegys or Breztris of the world, until further clarification about the specifics of the product, because the triple therapies really accomplish all of the components that you present for Product X in terms of reducing exacerbations, mortality. I don't really see any difference. If I had data comparing it to the existing triple therapies, and I saw some advantage over that, then I would consider using it with greater frequency or in that patient subpopulation. But until I have that knowledge, I will just consider it to be a me too drug to a triple therapy."
"Okay. Certainly A, I would definitely include as my opening statement. I would say, ""Hey, doctors out there in patients, you're not paying enough attention to COPD. COPD is a huge problem. COPD is a very, very serious problem in line with cardiovascular disease and cancer. We really have to look at COPD patients through a different glass and identify them much quicker and be much more aggressive in treatment of COPD."" The second, B, I would delete, because you're going to be addressing people in the United States, and it's not necessary to really compare it to the rest of the world."
"Yeah, let's see. C, they're going to be... Well, this is kind of a takeoff on A, because it's quantifying the great extent of exacerbations and the fact that they're not being reported. I would keep that slide kind of like as an ancillary to A. That most of the patients, you don't even know are having a exacerbations, and you should really question them when they come to the office to see if they did have something that qualifies as an exacerbation. I would leave that in. "
"D, would definitely be included, because I need to highlight to everybody that once you have an exacerbation, you're never going to be the same as you were previously. And with more and more exacerbations, it's going to cause irreversible lung damage, and a hastening of premature death. This one, I would include, because the number is so high, the 80% risk of death. Everybody knows that the more exacerbations you have, the greater the likelihood of death. But because the number is so great, I would leave it in just to highlight how serious it is."
"Yes, G, I would definitely keep to emphasize that it's not just a pulmonary disease, that it also has a strong bearing on cardiovascular health. H, I would keep, also, because of the emphasizing the corelation and the co-dependence of the heart on the lungs and the brain. I, I'm not sure I would keep. J, I'm not so sure. I would delete that one, because it's common knowledge that if you don't have enough oxygen, that's going to have a deleterious effect on your heart and your brain. So I think it's not really not adding any new knowledge. "
"K, I'm not so sure if it's that relevant to your presentation. I would eliminate that one. I, I think it's important to... I mean, L, is that L?"
"It's important to keep, to reiterate the fact that the biggest risk for an exacerbation is a previous exacerbation, and it happens very frequently, and it happens very rapidly and it's a cause for premature mortality. That's a very important point. M, I would eliminate it as kind of obvious and not really contributing anything to the picture. N, normally, I would leave it out, but it seems like Product X is trying to make an important differentiating fact about this idea about eosinophil counts and allergic components. Normally, I would delete it, but it seems, from where they're going with this, they view that as a differentiating factor from other products, so I would leave it in."
Here we are. Here we are. O and P on the bottom.
"Okay. O, I think, important to keep in there because it highlights the debate about, should we use a stepwise approach with these patients or should we hit them with everything that we have right away to prevent progression? It's very important, it's topical, it's very relevant and it really affects the way that we're going to treat COPD patients in the future. P, I guess I would eliminate it, because it's a basic, it's like COPD 101, and it's... If you wanted to keep it for the sake of completeness, to highlight nonpharmacological treatments, but if you're talking specifically about Product X, I don't think it's really relevant. "
"On one hand I would keep them, because they're all important factors, but on the other hand, I'm kind of turned off to them, because these are the same slides that I would expect to see with one of the triple therapies compared to dual therapy. If there were no triple therapies yet available on the market, I would say definitely include it. But since we do have triple therapies and the data is pretty much the same with the other triples, I don't really see the relevance. I really need to have more information on Product X to see whether it's somewhat differentiated from what we already have available. "
"Oh, and a wonderful weekend. TGIF. Thank you so much. It's been a pleasure talking to you. Take care now. "
"I'm a general cardiologist. I've been in practice for over 20 years. I have practiced in the Denver Metro area for about 20 of those years. And now I work in several practices in other states, part-time."
"Well, normal ejection fraction versus degrees of LV dysfunction, mild, moderate, severe."
"I would say an EF of less than 55 to 50 is low, normal. Below 50 is definitely abnormal. Below 40 is moderate. Below 30 is severe."
"I would call them low, normal, and have a high suspicion there may be something going on."
"Well, a lot of times preserved... Or sometimes, preserved ejection fraction heart failure can progress to LV dysfunction. But honestly, how would I say, the diagnosis of LV dysfunction is a lot easier to make than preserved ejection of heart failure. And treatment, I think is much more clear cut."
"You're looking at patients who are short of breath, you're looking at their echo, you're looking at degrees of diastolic dysfunction and trying to put the picture together. Whereas if they're short of breath and edematous, and they have an EF of 30%, it's pretty clear cut what they have."
"What's that? Could you repeat the question, I didn't catch it?"
"Hard to say. I think it depends if you treat... If they're caught early, treated. It depends what's causing diastolic dysfunction. Do they have a disease like such as amyloid. Some precipitous factor. So it's hard to put a percentage on it, that's what I... In my small patient population."
"Well, diastolic dysfunction is LV dysfunction that is not apparent necessarily on the 2D images of the echocardiogram. But you're seeing parameters of impaired relaxation of the ventricle stiffness, those kinds of things, which are potentially early signs of LV dysfunction. LV dysfunction is clearly when you look at an echo and you'll see diastolic dysfunction, but you'll see the image, it's just that the heart doesn't squeeze well."
"Whereas preserved ejection fraction, yeah, it looks kind of okay, but there're some problems going on, but they're not obvious."
"And then they can have symptomatic in their degrees of diastolic dysfunction, mild, moderate, severe, reversible, irreversible. And you can see diastolic dysfunction without clinical symptoms. You can see diastolic dysfunction with severe clinical symptoms."
"It gets complicated, it's not obvious. That's what I can tell you."
"It can be, yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's not just one test that you do or say, that's it. You got to kind of put the picture together."
"And there are other things that can mimic. For example, a patient has pulmonary hypertension, they can not look like they potentially have diastolic heart failure. Which they might, in combination of other things going on."
"They're edematous, they're short of breath, those kind of things."
"Well, you can have a patient come who is hypertensive. For example, patient comes hypertensive, short of breath. They may even have some mild edema, they may not. You do an echo and you see thickening of the left ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy. They have diastolic dysfunction. This is this kind of like, all right, this is what's going on. They have observed ejection fraction, but they have other comorbidities that have caught or contributed to diastolic dysfunction. And that's what you're seeing."
"The data says that if you have severe... Or if you have L  inaudible 00:10:54  preserved ejection fraction, but with heart failure, prognosis is not great and it gets worse as the more severe it is."
"Symptoms, New York Heart Association class 1, degrees of LVH, I guess, degrees of diastolic dysfunction. Do they have restrictive physiology? These kind of things are bad prognostic. Elevated BNP. These are all prognostic for worse outcomes."
"Well, in my opinion, no, you need to treat both. And you try to prevent it from getting worse, either one. Or try to improve the situation."
"Yeah. I mean, particularly if they're symptomatic. Yes, absolutely."
"Well, treatment options, they're not great. The guidelines to treat LV dysfunction are much more clear. Carvedilols, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, afterload reduction, defibrillators, those kind of things. Whereas, yeah, we can look for diastolic dysfunction, but what are you going to do about it? You treat the hypertensions, you give a diuretic for the edema and hope it doesn't progress, but there's no some beta blockers. But it's not as clear of what you can impact, that's what I would tell you."
"There's no drug, ""Oh yeah, this is the one use for preserved ejection fraction heart failure."""
"I know there's stuff around, but I'm not really familiar, that's what I can tell you. I kind of read the ACC guidelines and follow those."
"All right. So 55 year old male came to me, probably 70, 80 pounds overweight. Type two diabetes, hypertension. He had some edema as well. He was on lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide. His blood pressure was not well controlled. And he said that he's noticed he's had more shortness of breath over the last six months."
"And he had an echocardiogram of 52%. Low, normal. You didn't ask about any other testing I would do on this patient. So yeah, go from there."
He was referred. They were both referred by primary care physicians. I'd say most of my patients are consultative.
"I think basically that the primary care had put him on lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide, hadn't noticed a lot of improvement. Rightly so, the primary care and I was very concerned that this patient had underlying coronary artery disease. Did this represent some kind of ischemia that was contributing to his symptoms."
None. The primary care sent him to me for evaluation and treatment.
"Blood pressure was elevated at, I don't remember exactly, but probably like 150 over 90. Heart rate was probably, and  inaudible 00:17:42  about 90 beats per minute. He was 70 pounds overweight. And I didn't notice any edema. His lungs were cleared to auscultation. On exam, I may have heard an S4 gallop. And no hepatojugular reflux, or things like that."
"Well, is this uncontrolled hypertension causing diastolic heart failure? Does he have underlying coronary artery disease? This patient clearly warranted an evaluation of ejection fraction. And I was likely going to proceed with an ischemic workup, meaning some kind of stress test."
"I push a button on the EMR, the order goes into the system and it's done. And I say, is it urgent or elective. And they come to our office to have it done as an outpatient."
"In a patient like this, probably within a week, if the patient's agreeable."
"No, I clicked elective. I knew I'd get the results in about a week or so."
Yeah. I read the echos on all my patients.
"Some left ventricular hypertrophy. If I recall, some grade 2 diastolic dysfunction. No obvious wall motion abnormality, it was kind of a global reduced ejection fraction."
"This one's easy. A hypertensive fat diabetic with a mildly reduced ejection fraction, with diastolic dysfunction."
"All right. I'll give you an... I'm just thinking. So I'm thinking of more like the secondary... Like something like a secondary cause. All right. So a patient came in, this is a few years ago, who had a stroke. Nobody knew why. And I do an echo on him and he's got biatrial enlargement with some mildly reduced ejection fraction and LVH. He then develops some anemia and some renal dysfunction. And this is a guy who's like 60 years old, otherwise healthy, never really had any problems. So the bottom line is, I was became highly suspicious that he had amyloid. So he had diastolic dysfunction, he had some kidney dysfunction, he had biatrial enlargement, he had a cryptogenic stroke. And the reason I suspected possibly amyloid, is you can get atrial standstill from the infiltration of the amyloid into the atrium, but he wasn't an A-fib. And sure enough, a week later after I saw him, he developed A-fib. So bottom line, I sent him for a fat pad biopsy at amyloid, and unfortunately he died in six weeks. So that's a different kind of disease, if that's what you're asking."
"And I mean, there's a whole area of, I don't have to tell your company, but cardio-oncology monitoring for chemotherapy, looking for early signs of LV dysfunction, things like that. Diastolic dysfunction."
"Well, the ones that are easy are like this guy, he had a positive stress test."
"He'll end up getting a cabbage after a carved him. So the diastolic dysfunction and the shortness of breath was ischemia. And when we revascularized him, he got better."
So those are the easy ones. The ones with normal coronaries are not so easy.
"Well, I wanted to know if he was ischemic or not, and he was, and he got revascularized and he was on a beta blocker or ACE inhibitor. I think he's off at diuretic at this point. It's that risk factor modification, that kind of thing."
"And also, I can tell you the guidelines. It's just kind of murky. But the whole diagnosis was murky."
It's almost like a diagnosis of exclusion.
"Secondary causes of any kind. And is it just a stiff ventricle on a guy whose hypertensive, diabetic and that's it. And that's what he's got and symptomatic. All right, this is what we can offer you. I just feel like, I don't know, how much can I impact the progression of this disease?"
"Yeah. It's easy. I could get the ventricle better and I can see it on the echo very easily. Oh, their EF was 30, now it's 50. Something like that."
"How would I say it? Yes. But you always feel like, am I missing something?"
I think there's just less certainty around the diagnosis.
"I say to them that we're seeing some signs of heart dysfunction. That lifestyle, like in this guy, weight loss, exercise, control your blood pressure, all these things can impact your outcome. But there's no magic cure for this."
"I give them a diagnosis of, ""Yeah, you have some early heart failure."" I try to say early heart failure, keep it simple. ""But there's things you can do, hopefully that we can prevent this from getting worse and potentially reverse it."" Scare them a little bit."
"So they don't rush to McDonald's or puff a pack of cigarettes. Or maybe they do after I tell them, I don't know."
"Because I want them to do things, lifestyle wise. I want to give them a reason to do it."
"Not really, no. I mean, it's the same drugs, it's the same... It is what it is. And I guess, I'll monitor them. If things get worse, I'm going to be highly suspicious that things is irrelevant, moreso it will be dysfunction, or what's going on."
"No, they wouldn't say that. They say I have congestive heart failure or I have heart failure."
"When the doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, maybe."
"Jardiance has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes. So sulfonylureas we don't use anymore. It's Glucophage and then Jardiance. I can tell you, in my practice, I don't manage a lot of the diabetes. I'll make recommendations, say these are the... I see something obvious like, ""These are not drugs with cardiovascular benefit."" I'll mention to the primary care that, ""You should consider a change. These are the drugs to consider changing."" But I don't manage it."
"It's more the primary care, although cardiologists are now becoming and should be. And I've done some education that we should be more involved in this."
"I don't know. I mean, the issue is, I'm so busy. I don't know if I have the time to manage diabetes. You know what I mean? I just don't know if that's the best use of my time. I mean, somebody has to do it, I'm just not sure I'm the person to do it."
"I wish I had the time, how's that? You know what I mean? I mean, I manage high blood pressure, I manage high cholesterol, I manage a lot of things, but I haven't really gotten into the diabetic side. Some cardiologists are, others. I think it's an area of growth, put it that way."
"And again, I'm like, I've been in this for 20 years. I don't know what the new guys are.... Are they getting fellowship training? Are they getting involved in this? That kind of thing. I was never involved with some fellowship."
"Yeah. Which is obviously a major problem in healthcare in the United States. But it's definitely something I will mention to the primary care. If I see there's an endocrinologist, I'll definitely copy him. Although, usually the patients that are seen by endocrinologists are well managed. I haven't had it. It never had it. I can't think of an issue of any of our endocrinologists where they weren't on the right drugs. But yeah, that's what I can tell you. That's my knowledge base of it."
"It depends. So I practice in some extremely rural areas in the Pacific Northwest, where they're lucky to even see me, as a specialist. And then there's some areas where I practice and patients have full access to all specialists. So it just kind of depends on the location."
"Now, I can tell you, in Denver, there's just not... And we're in a major metropolitan area here. Again, the problem with an endocrinologist is pretty hard right now, because they're busy and they're not that many of them. I don't ever feel like I'm stepping on toes if I need to mention something. You know what I mean? I never get pushback."
"I'd say it's 95%, maybe even more primary care. We'll occasionally get a couple in the ER, but usually those are more LV dysfunction because they see it on the echo and patient presents with LV dysfunction, that kind of thing. It's usually not as dramatic, this. So I'd say it's pretty much all primary care. I don't have too many patients walk in and say, ""Hey, I'm short of breath."" I guess some pulmonologists will. I will, because exercise induced asthma, things like that. If they don't have it and they're like, ""Go see a cardiologist."" That kind of thing."
"Rarely nephrologists, because if they have kidney failure, they've already seen me."
"Sorry, my wife just closed the door. She obviously want to hear this. She's a liver transplant doc, so she's... Anyway. But I'm not sure what you're getting at. So if you want to tell me  inaudible 00:36:23 , that's what I would tell you."
"I haven't done that. I have not done that, personally."
"A lot of times what I do, we do, is we have physician extenders, nurse practitioners, and I'll say, ""All right, we got a patient here with an EF of 52%. They have diastolic heart failure. Their blood pressure isn't optimal. Their fluid status isn't optimal. I've started these drugs, titrate them and call me. And then let me know if they're not following the pathway and then I'll get involved."" That kind of thing."
"And also usually what we do is we alternate visits. So if they see the nurse practitioner, they'll see me the next visit, vice versa. But it just improves my access."
"Yeah, I'd say it depends how they're doing. Initially, every couple two to three months, I'd say. Ballpark, depending. And then we try to push it out to six months and then yearly if they're stable."
"And also education. Things about, things to watch out for if you're not weighing yourself, that kind of thing, fluid intake. Just education. The classic heart failure education."
"I say ballpark, yes. Ballpark, yes. But if you have a patient who has diastolic heart failure, their blood pressure is 160 over 90, and you can't get it down, it can get more labor intensive. It depends on how they respond to therapy."
"And then education. Diet, exercise, things like that. Blood sugars. Just things we can modify."
"Exercise. Their insurance will pay for it. Even if we can get them into like the formal cardiac rehab program, if they have heart failure, where they work with them on diet, stress management, all those things. Getting them moving in a supervised setting, building their stamina, those kind of things."
"I think it is kind of a wake up call. Cardiovascular disease, I mean, one of my mentors said, is a culinary disease. It's what we eat. And in many respects, it is. And it's changing your diet, it's changing your... It's all these things."
"It's all the things we struggle with, including Dawn."
"If you look at the guidelines, if the patient is doing well, there's no indication to re-image them. You're talking about, in preserved ejection fraction."
"Yeah. So if they're doing well, I will not re-image them on a routine basis."
"I will check BMPs. I will check them initially, see where they are, because that can be like a very strong indicator. It's also something you can follow. And then what I'll do is, sometimes if I see improvement, sometimes I'll check it, see if it's correlating, it comes down. And then if I see patients decompensating, I'll check it so I have some kind of measurement, and it could be useful. Again, in the renal dysfunction... They're definitely issues that older patients have higher BMPs generally, and renal failure, those kind of things, but it can be useful."
"You can't order it without the clinical background. It's not like, ""Oh, they got an elevated BMP, they got heart failure."" Or they're getting worse. At least, their kidneys are getting worse. You have to put it together. It's like any laboratory test, you have to look in the clinical context or it could be useless or cause more problems than it's worth or should. You don't check troponins in asymptomatic patients, right? That's the point."
"Well, their symptoms, how they're feeling, is probably the biggest one. You can look at sodium, see if they're hyponatremic. It helps with fluid status, kidney, things like the kidney function. But usually, it's the history and physical is the most important thing."
"Have they developed ischemia? Is their blood pressure out of control? Sleep apnea, is that not being treated or have we not addressed that. Dietary noncompliance. So those are some of the things that we first think of."
"Right. Or a medication adjustment, depending on what I'm seeing. Do their blood prep if they need a change of blood pressure medication, that kind of thing."
"No, you can stabilize them and they can be quite stable for years."
"I don't usually use it in preserved heart failure. I use it in LV dysfunction. And I've seen dramatic results with it. I think there's been some controversy about the studies, how good they were. But anecdotally, I will use it if the insurance will pay for it. In patients with severe heart dysfunction, I have no issue doing it, if their blood pressure will tolerate it."
"Sometimes I'll use ACE inhibitors first, just for cost. And I'll definitely switch patients from ACE inhibitors to it if they're not responding, and I've seen patients improve after doing it."
I've never used it in preserved heart failure.
"Not that I'm aware of, honestly. Not that I'm..."
"Like the typical things you'd look at, improvement of New York Heart Association Classification. You can look at echo parameters to see if diastology improves. And then mortality, 30 day maze and longer. Not 30, but long mortality."
"If it's FDA approved, I'll give it out like water."
"Or honestly they have to, because they don't have access to cardiology."
I think this is in the realm of cardiology.
"Because there's so many other things you have to consider, stress ischemia, there are lots. I mean, if I had this problem, I'd want to see a cardiologist"
Especially given the implications down the road with mortality and things like that.
"So this is someone who's a lot older. Heart failures a disease of the elderly. He has mildly reduced EF. He's 45. He's more symptomatic, he's class 3 heart failure. He's not obese, but he has hypertension. He's on lisinopril, he's on Lasix. Assuming a stronger diuretic, because he actually has edema. So he has obvious... This patient clearly has heart failure."
"Yes, 45. So he does have reduced ejection fraction. He did not have coronary artery disease, I can tell you."
"And not a lot I can do for him, because there weren't a lot of options. He didn't need revascularization, he was not obese, he's just older. He has an old, stiff heart."
Right. He's further down the spectrum. Yes.
"Is he at 45, it's not 35, so that's... These are the medicines he was on when I saw him. I consider adding carvedilol here to this patient."
"And get his blood pressure as low as possible, that he is not symptomatic, that he can tolerate. But it's basically medical therapy. There's nothing else I can offer him."
"Consider it. Yeah, I would. I would. Yeah. I don't remember what his renal function was, what his potassium was, something like that, but I would consider it."
"Yeah. So you wanted one more preserved than that probably, based on what you're asking for. I can tell you he was preserved and then it got worse."
"He had progression of diastolic heart failure and systolic heart failure. He's on that spectrum. He is on that string. He's over 75. But regardless of age, it's medical therapy."
"No, it's not. And especially with the aging process, diastology got worse."
"I'm curious, can you tell me what your client is  inaudible 00:53:13 ? Are they marketing a drug or..."
"No diagnosis. Is there a gold standard test? I haven't seen it. That's cheap, easy and accessible. That would be great. Either an imaging test, a blood test, something. Okay. Then a treatment pathway that is clear, easy to initiate, cost effective and improves symptoms and mortality. And I guess patient compliance, that it's easy to take the pill, if not, an infusion, whatever. Okay. And that has a broad indication over multiple age groups, but particularly the elderly, because this is a disease in the old."
"Basically, that it is interfering with their daily lives."
"It's not like a light bulb goes off and you say, ""I got heart failure. I got to go see the doctor."" It's insidious."
"I can't think of anything. Based on the way disease processes, I don't see like, at least I don't, that, all right, is this a disease you're going to screen for like colon cancer?"
Are you going to screen for preserved heart failure before patients are even symptomatic and institute treatment? I don't see that. I don't see the test. I just don't see how you can do that. I guess the issue is to jump on comorbidities as fast as possible. That's your best defense.
"Nonspecific tests, sensitivity and specificity are not appropriate."
"Yeah. No, it's not like looking for a tumor, take it out. I don't see it. That's what I can tell you."
"I think your best weapon for this disease is people to live a healthy lifestyle. And if they have comorbidities to treat, try to prevent it from happening or at least push it off until they're 75 and not 55."
We need better diagnostic and treatments.
"I want to just touch base because I do track... I forgot to say this at the beginning. I work with MeiLan at U of M, but we run a COPD clinic there, a transitional care clinic so we do see a lot of people discharged from the hospital into the clinic. And I actually track these people and you would... It is not surprising that people come in with one diagnosis, either COPD exacerbation or pneumonia, and go home with another because nobody knows what to call anything. Sometimes just both diagnosises. So I think it's very confusing even from the time they get in and they're there a couple days and going home. And the problem is that a lot of times if these people get readmitted because there's COPD in the chart and it's an exacerbation, you get a re-admission for COPD and it's going to count against you."
No wonder. I've been saying that   00:42:07 
"I was. And now I forgot what I was going to say. No, I didn't. I think this conversation doesn't happen in a primary care environment. I think that the patients, the concern about exacerbations is much greater and people, if a pneumonia happens, even if the association may not be fully appreciated, but I think the immediacy of an exacerbation or prevention exacerbations is a higher priority. And it may... I think I wouldn't disagree with the idea of the low risk patient, but the patient that already has exacerbations or is at risk for exacerbations, I think that you really hit them in the full court press. And the pneumonia conversation doesn't come up with the patient very frequently, and frankly may not even be much a consideration for many primary care clinicians."
"I think in primary care, I don't know that people are really making a difference. I think that they're trying to optimize their therapy for COPD. And I don't think that having an episode of pneumonia is necessary decision point in terms of stopping the steroid component of the double or triple therapy."
"But there is a benefit to theoretical discussion about this. I mean, once again, I don't think most commissions really differentiate between the different classes. Think of them generally as steroid. However, if you can provide a rationale for why one might be safer than the other, one might have a different characteristic, then I think it does give a rationale for making a choice."
"I think it's food for thought. I don't think I'd really considered that aspect. And I think that MeiLan's data and the way she presented it, makes you think, well, so these are not the opportunity to provide a milieu for a likely, both pneumonia as well as for  mililia 01:16:02  infections, is not bad rationale."
"But in the primary care environment there's so many things people are thinking about, I don't know that this is a consideration most would give. But I think that's something you can do. You can have us consider these when making decision about what agents we're going to use."
"Well, you did talk about the less than 2% being more likely, the eosinophils, be more likely to get pneumonia. And then you also showed that those patients are more likely to get, I thought you said to get Candida, so that may be differentiation. I don't think that's going to figure into a lot of people's clinical decision making, but I think that gives a rationale at least."
"In truth, it probably doesn't. I mean, it's both availability. Access is probably the most important thing in terms of what makes the decision and that's where you get people thinking of the steward as a class effect versus something different. But I think you've got a good rationale. I mean, you could figure this into the decision making process. I don't think it's data that's been presented to us before, and therefore part of the decision making algorithm."
"I think as mentioned, devices is critical. So how easy is it for the patient to use? Are they going to get the drug and how easy is it to teach? So all of those things are factored into... We're looking at trying to be as efficient as possible within the office visit. So those are really more the considerations. If you take away access, I wish you could take away access, but that's necessarily the reality."
"Not really additional. I believe I concur essentially with the last statement. I think, though there seem to be differences in the molecules and differences even on the devices, I think that we still need some more data. And especially we have, as Jill would say, we do have the FDA establishing some form of a class problem with this, right? And so inhaled corticosteroids for most of the practitioners remain inhaled corticosteroids, and with minimal differences."
"And I think this is everything that we all experience when you try to call either your primary doctors, referral doctors, or even explain to the patients that I'm going to switch from this to this other. They keep looking at USA. Isn't that the same? And again, I'm not trying to say that's exactly where it is, but having some more robust data might be very helpful for establishing a point like this."
"Well, I mean, if I have to continue myself, I will say, I mean, a clear, clear analysis and data that shows that there is a significant difference between both. And I've read comparison obviously, will be what everybody cites and like to have and study that shows definitely the head-to-head comparison between these two products."
"Now, speaking on the practicalities of that, my feeling we would like to see is some more studies with budesonide as an example, that show clearly that we can clear this effect of pneumonia on those patients, as opposed to more studies maybe on fluticasone asking for more patients with pneumonia."
"And again, I'm probably asking what is my wishlist, right, on that? And not necessarily what's practicality oriented, and I totally understand. But again, the more and more small details that we can bring on board, that would be helpful."
"But I'm talking about clinical data and again, unfortunately, molecular data and size of particles and the position of particles, I mean, with all due respect, I mean, we're talking about it, but it's not the bread and butter for the practitioner on the street, right? That's one reality."
"So Norbert was very convincing. I mean, I think the data, the data was good. I think that's what we're asking for, in terms of is there something, clinically significant difference? And it was, it looked like not only was it statistically significant, but also clinically relevant. So, and I don't think that's data that has really permeated the marketplace yet. So now you have some data that supports less adverse effects with regards to pneumonia, and you have a mechanistic explanation for it. So I think that's fairly compelling."
"I have question, a question slash comment. And it stems from well over a decade ago, when GSK began to wrestle with this question of does fluticasone, or do inhaled steroids, are they associated with a pneumonia signal? And I'm sitting on an advisory board, and they compiled thousands and thousands and thousands of patients from every study they had, where a patient had been exposed to an inhaled glucocorticoid. And they looked at each study individually, and then they looked at them as an agglomerate mass. And the prevalence of pneumonia, I recollect to be around 6% or so. And when I first saw the symbicort data, it looked like around 3%."
"So I'm wondering, if you just did something very similar and very simple like that, and look at every, I mean, you must have probably 15,000 patients who've been exposed to budesonide in your studies where you have data about pneumonia, that you could give us a good handle on what the prevalence is. In the individual studies, which would answer Milan's question of is it increasing over time where that would focus you to look to a device? Or is it staying stable and there's just some sort of vacillation around it? Maybe it's a dumb idea, but."
"Yeah, if I may add here, just actually the controversial Lipson studies, the problem was not in the sample size, it's really the number of pneumonias, which was the numbers that are way less, Jill, than what the numbers you quoted. So they had like single digit numbers of pneumonias in one and whatever, double in the other. So out of 900 people, it's like eight or something. So that is the problem, and that is the reason why the study cannot be taken. But those are very low numbers, different than the one numbers that you're mentioning."
"But I think all things being equal, you know, if it, I say safety trumps efficacy every time. If we're looking at, if we assume that the efficacy of fluticasone and budesonide are similar in this process, why wouldn't you choose something that has less impact? Even though we don't, may not see a lot of pneumonia, well let's now have the discussion as well. Why wouldn't you choose an agent that has a safety profile with regards to pneumonia, that's better than the other?"
"Well, I need to get paid what you get paid then."
"Can I say something as well, please? So, thank you. I think the data are pointing towards a higher risk with fluticasone for pneumonia and is pointing to an...."
"As long as we're talking about number needed to treat and not looking or not being concerned about other things like cost and device ability to use device. Why don't you throw in the number needed to treat, to save a life? That might be an interesting part of the comparators as well."
Actually I've been introducing many of  Norbert's 02:13:48  slides tonight. I think I ought to get a cut of what he gets made paid to me.
You're saying 58 versus 32 number needed to treat to harm. So number needed to treat to harm for pneumonia for   02:14:44 .
"Okay. But still. So the number needed to cause a serious pneumonia for Breztri is 58 and for Trelegy, it was 32?"
"Yeah. If I may comment and maybe ask like relatively open, the conceptual question is really getting back the question to you guys, but it's your advisory board obviously. You are having great data and you're tackling a different issue, which is additional heterogeneity already, very heterogeneous disease. And you are adding to this equation with many variables that we don't understand well, also this additional thing about different interclass differentiation. That itself can open a separate can of worms, because the most of other... We're talking about triple inhalers and those are other two classes that are also haven't been compared head to head. And if the goal is really to get the data out, probably still the target is your competitor that has a different triple agent. And in that sense, then again, a lot of vulnerability in heterogenality in the other drugs. Overall, their exacerbation rate in impact study was still a little lower than the exacerbation rate overall in ethos."
"And I would say that its valid data, but I think it needs to be very carefully taught in what is actually the goal, but I hundred percent do agree that interclass variability must exist, that we have also among LAMAS. Now we have completely different chemical structure agents that are coming in. And by default there will be something down the road if it needs to be further clarified. But you understand that this is very, very sensitive question that you may easily get yourself in a very thin ice."
"I like Milan's thought process about the long haul. I think, number one, the long haul for complications. But I also like the idea of the long haul for rate of decline. I think it's time to start introducing the concept of mortality in these drugs, but I don't think that we're at a point where you can say we do better with mortality than the other guys. But I think it's important to at least say we're beginning to butt up against the concept that drugs can actually affect mortality, especially when you place it in the context of perhaps, because not only do we decrease exacerbation frequency, but we affect rate of decline or have less systemic side effects, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So I think they're separate, but also intertwined."
"One of the benefits of saying that asthma was advair deficiency is that actually asthma got treated more effectively. And I think COPD is being treated ineffectively as well. I think that Barbara's comments about  inaudible 02:26:19 , not using the right gold criteria in a way. We tend to decrease our perception of the severity. We tend to undertreat the importance of exacerbations has not yet been permeated the field. So you obviously don't want to be promoting triple therapy for those patients that don't need it, but I would put that there are a lot of patients that do need it, that aren't getting it. And so it's a fine balance. And that's where education has is an important role."
"I would like to add that not only is this nuanced, but when you try to sort out the benefits of one versus the other, that is Trelegy versus Breztri, you really approach some of the things that the legal and licensing people really would, I think, would get their ire because the data is blurred. It's not crisp. It's not clear, it's not definite. That would be my first warning to you. My other thought is if you want to try to create some difference, and I apologize for not knowing what device this is coming out in, is it an MDI? That's my thought. So I think you might better spend your time looking at PMDI versus DPI. We know that Trelegy's got the Achilles heel of a DPI that the patients at greatest... We've already talked a lot about patients at greatest risk for an exacerbation. Those are going to be the people who are also going to be at greatest risk to be not strong enough, or at least sometimes not strong enough to get their inhaler drug through a DPI, realizing that their strength vacillates with whether they're going into or coming out of an exacerbation. I think you tell would be better spent looking there than some of these other nuanced discussions, but it's one person's view."
Okay. You want   00:00:33  my webcam? All right. What's that?
"No, I understand that. Do you want the webcam?"
"Okay. Well, I'm a board certified pulmonary medicine specialist in a practice with three other pulmonologists suburban Western America, mostly consultative pulmonary. Patients are referred from generally primary care for evaluation and treatment and management. So I'm both diagnosing and treating and then following and making treatment modifications as necessary."
I'm sorry. What was... How would I describe triple therapy to the patient?
"I'm sorry. I didn't. Yeah, well, certainly a GOLDD or GOLDC very cognizant that these patients probably will require triple therapy, but if they're... I mean, oftentimes I'll start with step therapy, so I'll start with  Almaa 00:03:31 . If that's not effective Alma LABA, and then escalate to a triple at that point, if however, they've already presented with a number of exacerbations or have a evidence of bronchospasm, then I might put triple in earlier in the regimen and skip the prior two steps.   00:03:53  So it's basically... Yeah, so I mean, a GOLDD, or a GOLDC would certainly be a major trigger for seriously contemplating starting a triple."
"Well, moderate exacerbation to me is someone who requires either oral or injectable steroids and antibiotic, but can  inaudible 00:04:35  (silence)"
"Oh, so we were talking about trilogy versus Breztri"
"It's really a patient preference of whether they... Some patients are really prefer the dry mist. And so they'll go with the trilogy. Others are really averse to it... So it's yeah, but in terms of efficacy, I don't see that they're particularly different as agents."
Okay. I see   00:10:00  the powerful protection of Breztri.
"It's pretty aggressive. Go on. Tell me more. You really have to dig down into the data to sort of... The implication, all patients with COPD should be on triple. And I think that's pushing the argument. These studies are done in specified populations of more moderate to severe COPDS, oftentimes with prior history of exacerbations. So to extrapolate the data from that group of patients to all comers is a very aggressive argument."
Honestly it's a very powerful argument. Yeah.
"Well, I think all of it is, I mean, clearly, I mean, I use a lot of triples for my COPD patients, and I am convinced that they prevent hospitalizations and COPD exacerbations. I think the mortality data is a little softer though. I think there is a trend towards improved mortality, at least in your higher risk patient populations. But it's interesting to start with a general discussion of the morbidity and mortality associated with exacerbation and then to... It's a clever slide it's, to go and then say, well, Breztri will prevent all that, but..."
I'm not sure. It talked about the risk of having exacerbation. It didn't really discuss the risk of exacerbations if I recall.
"Well, I mean, even GOLDA day or GOLDB who not had exacerbation last year could have an exacerbation next year, potentially. I mean, everyone's... I mean there's always that risk, but is that risk sufficient enough to indicate the use of a triple inhaler in this patient population? I guess that's the question at the very beginning, I said Ama GOLD Cs and DS who had previous exacerbations, I'm very quick to use triple therapy on, but would I use it... The implication from this is that even patients have never had an exacerbation should be treated because one exacerbation could be extremely toxic to them."
"No, I've been doing this long enough to know how morbid and a disease COPD is and how severe exacerbations can really impact people's lives."
"I mean, it's data that I was familiar with. So, I mean, I've heard that message before it's... I've been convinced about triple therapy for some time, so here it is a little bit preaching to the choir."
"Well, their trilogy know tr doesn't have the mortality differentiation, it does have the exacerbation data, but it doesn't... I mean, I have to go look at their studies previously, but I think they had a trend towards mortality, but didn't get a statistically significant improvement in mortality, which probably in my mind is more about study design than real difference in the molecules. But, it is differentiating in that sense. Because trilogy just can't make that claim at this point."
"Okay. So now that I'm seeing it's a little less aggressive because certainly as we spoke about once someone comes to me having one exacerbation with quite steroids antibiotics, I already put them into a higher risk category. So it's not really an all comers. It's funny that my impression was much broader, but yeah, so it's a much more... It's a subtler argument than, and one that I can actually agree with at this point wholeheartedly. Whereas if it was everyone, I'd be a little more skeptical."
Yeah. So certainly someone who's had an exacerbation or is still having bronchospasm is definitely in a much higher risk category. And then I'm completely on board with these claims.
"Yeah, no, that's fine. But it's a different argument because see the first one was saying symptomatic or already had an exacerbation. This one is a little... So yeah. This is just saying symptomatic, which is a different category. I mean, there may be patients who are asymptomatic in LAMA/LABA, but have had an exacerbation in the past year. It's a different population perhaps."
"The spirals COPD certainly, well known to anyone who's been treating these patients for some time. A little less impactful than the first and the second versions you showed, where..."
"Well, first of all, you're not actually including the patients who are still symptomatic on either single or double therapy, which you were in the first slide. Also I think the giving it a little bit of numerical precision impacts the strength of the argument rather than this is sort of just hand waving."
"Okay. Again, not talking about the patients who've already had an exacerbation, but it is interesting that 50% of exacerbations go unreported. It's probably true because patients do have... I routinely give them an emergency pack, a prescription first for prednisone and an antibiotic so that if they get sick on a weekend or a holiday they can start and then let us know. And you're probably actually right. That many of them just don't tell us that they've used it."
"Yeah. On the first one, I would put the bottom header on the top when actually turn them out of order out here."
"Oh, these are the alternates. I see. Okay."
"Yeah, I prefer the original to all the alternatives, frankly."
"UD. I don't think saying it's a third leading cause of death is relevant to pulmonologists. I mean in my practice it's the leading cause of death. So what difference does it make that number. So yeah, that doesn't add anything. This is a severe risk of breathing. No. I think all that was in your first slide and it was clearer in the first slide. First version.   00:27:35 "
"Yeah. And the spiral is an interesting thing to add. I mean, because it is sort of a vicious circle that as they get worse they exercise less. That is an interesting idea. But..."
"I mean, if you could sort of... I'm not saying, I don't I like the graphic particularly, but I think that idea that this is a sort of a vortex of dissent from symptoms to mortality is an interesting addition to the idea."
"Oh, treating earlier. I think the original Bill is   00:28:32 "
"I think the same order. Yeah. 1, 3, 2, 4. Yeah.   00:29:00  to differentiate from other closed triples. Well that's an interesting question, isn't it? I guess I'd have to say the same order, because Breztri really does have mortality data that the alternatives don't have at this point. You still have to fill with them U."
"Yeah, it doesn't change my... 1, 3, 2, 4 is still the... Yeah the Strength, the argument."
"Yes. Because I think that to show the path of physiology, because that's exactly what's happening is. One exacerbation does cause all these things, it sort of makes a little more concrete rather than just a ... There's a correlation, the graphic sort of allows you to at least think that you understand the causation."
"Yeah. It's interesting really there's... This literature is very hard to... Well, I mean, you were talking about graphics, because ICS LABAs don't have a mortality improvement, but yet Breztri are rather it's hard to show exacerbation improvements, but Breztri does, but not statistically significant where the LAMA/LABA do show exacerbation protection. It's a very strange... These picking these studies apart can be hard to interpret, but they put 2% reduction versus LAMA/LABA is an impressive number in this kind of setting. With the caveat, the argument against this is that they withdrew steroids on entry into the study in patients. That's why. Anyway, that's been banded about the literature."
"Okay. Well, I like the number needed to treat. That's always quite useful and powerful, so that's good."
"Well, because I think number needed to treat is actually in some respects, give you a more powerful idea of clinical efficacy. I mean, because if you look at fewer exacerbations, you're going from 0.95 to 0.46. A patient can't have a half of exacerbation every year. If you know what I'm saying, basically it means that in 100 patients, you'll only have 50 exacerbations versus a 100, but it's a little hard to pin that on an individual. If you look at a patient in front of you and they say, ""Well, if I start taking this stuff."" I'm going to say, ""well, instead of one exacerbation, next year you'll have half an excerbation next year."" Which is sort of the stupid thing to say. Right. But saying that, there's a one in three chance that you'll at least in my mind that you won't get an exacerbation. I mean, I think it's just a more concrete way to develop the statistics."
"Yeah. That's so much hedging in that one. It's also unusual to say that you're not really getting a reduction versus ICS LABA, which makes me say, why should I use Breztri? I can just use Advair or generic advair be just fine. So that's not really adding to the argument."
I think EC is an improvement on the original EA is not.
"So I think increase urgency to treat. So, okay. EC is one E the original is two and EA is three."
"Differentiation from other closed triples. Well, actually none of them really differentiate because it's not Breztri versus trilogy it's Breztri versus... I can't even remember what LAMA/LABA they used in the study, so. But I guess I'd have to say 2, 3, 1, just as a generic, but that's much weaker because you're really not differentiating from... of course there will never be a Breztri versus trilogy study, but that's okay."
"I know we want to hospitalizations. Okay. It's interesting that you sort of have flipped your statistics from LAMA/LABA to the ICS LABA. Now it's statistically sign from reduction from the ICS LABA, but not the LAMA/LABA that's why these studies are so hard to kind of piece together, but okay."
"Yeah. So here you have a number needed to treat again one and yeah, 31. Okay."
"Yeah, no, I think it's a stronger argument because when you look at you're going from 0.1, five to 13, that's very hard to wrap your head around. But, saying, ""Well, I have a panel of 200 severe COPD, and that means 10 less hospitalizations in a year."" That's a significant thing to a practitioner, Oh, yeah. Okay."
Okay. So a much stronger argument when you add a number needed to treat.
"Again, the numbers aren't significant and this is so it's pushing the argument to promote. Okay. It's a weaker presentation because again, the number needed to treat really strengthens this kind of an argument."
"It shows a trend which is of interest, but again, a trend that's not reaching statistical significant and also the numbers are quite small, so it's a little hard to interpret."
"Okay. So that one's a little less confusing that you're actually getting about a 20% decrease, both with LAMA/LABA and ICS LABA. That's a little clearer kind of messaging."
"So, yeah, I mean, it means that your definition of COPD hospitalizations varies from region to region. Yeah. That's why it's so hard to show us statistical improvement. Because oftentimes the reason for hospitalizing of COPD is more social than actually physiological, what's their home support system. Well what's their compliance of medication. So yeah, it's never a very strong argument."
"Not really. Yeah. I mean, you're taking such different healthcare systems and trying to... There's definitely a trend. I mean, it is just showing that there's a approximately 20% trend towards decreased hospitalizations. I think that's pretty clear you're not going to get any stronger argument than that."
"I liked HA I thought that was an improvement. HB was not an improvement and HC, can I see the original again? Sorry."
Yeah. I'd say HC is an improvement as well. Yeah.
"Urgency to treat earlier. I'd say, let's see. HA is one, HC is two. The original is three and HB is four. Yeah. I mean, it's the same across, I mean, 3, 1, 4, 2 for motivation for Breztri And then-"
"Differentiate. Yeah. It's saying the same thing. 3, 1, 4, 2. It's done."
"Okie-dokie. There's so many caveats as your statistics here, but okay. But you do have to... Again, you know how I like these number needed to treat, so that's good. I mean, 1, 88, so that's a strong thing. Okay."
"Well, of course every life saved, it's almost offensive matters, their loved ones, it's almost like you're flipping the graph. Yeah. And I think rising graphs are stronger, but okay."
"They're more optimistic. This is a pessimistic graph sort of, we're all heading towards that. Right. If you make it 500 weeks, suddenly we're, all that arrow is pointing down. It's quite a sobering thought."
Okay. It's just simpler and a little less confusing. Okay.
"Yeah. I mean, I think it's just a simpler argument that you're getting a decrease all cause death and number needed to treat of 80. It's just very, very simple and powerful and getting rid of all these weird Kaplan-Meier graphs that just confuse people."
"I'd say B is an improvement on the original and C is not MB, MC."
"Well, I'd say MB is one, M is two and MC is three and that's going to be   00:46:19  consistent. No, it's going to be consistent for the whole grid."
"It's an interesting argument. Talk about apples and oranges here, but..."
"It's interesting. And I've never really seen anything like this. It's very interesting to think about that the impact of treating... But how to express it. They're different patient populations, different disease states. You're just sort of saying this is your absolute reduction in risk of death, compared to that, it's an interesting argument. I'm not sure exactly how to process it. I mean preventing even one of my 80 COPD patients from dying is really important. I don't have to, I'm not really thinking, well, it's not a choice. Should you take your statins? And in some ways it's also saying, ""Well, if you're not willing to take a statin, I don't know. It's yeah. I'm not being very eloquent on this one. It's..."
"Not really. I mean, because I don't know the number needed to treat in a statin trial or number needed to treat in a diabetes trial. So it's sort of... I'm not sure really what to do with the statistic to be quite frank."
"Yeah. I mean, though, I don't necessarily argue that, 50% of exacerbation go unreported, I'd like to see a reference on that one. Because I mean it say, go unreported, how do you know about them? So it's a very... That's his argument. I mean, and that no prior exacerbations and you're still getting a Breztri effect. That's a very powerful graphic there. Right."
"I think I have to really look at your trials, most of the trials, with my recall required exacerbations for entry."
"Well I mean, if you could tell me they're uncontrolled on dual therapy, I would say, ""Yeah, I can certainly wrap my head around that one."" And say, ""That makes a lot of sense."" If they're really asymptomatic, then I'd say, ""I'm not so sure about that one."""
"Well, because there's toxicity with these agents as well. I mean, they're not totally benign therapies so that you have to weigh risk and benefits and in any low risk population, that's not had exacerbations that really need to see data that you're getting these improvements."
Yes. I think that one is a gives stronger support to early Breztri use.
"Well, I have to re look at Cronus entry criteria, and to see how severe those patients were, but my suspicion is they were uncontrolled on dual therapy, but which does put them at risk for future exacerbation."
But certainly it makes a strong argument that the lack of a recent exacerbation is not an impediment to starting Breztri in this population if they're otherwise appropriate.
"Yeah. I don't think these case studies add nothing to the argument, to be honest."
"I don't think it really changes the story. I think it just makes it a little more concrete again, because I'm a sucker for these number needed to treat, which is it's not just me. I mean, P values are, could be very deceptive because you can have a statistically significant result that really has no clinical relevance. And I think by showing numbers in the treat, it really shows that this really is a clinically significant difference in outcomes in terms of mortality and hospitalizations and exacerbations. Now I think it concretices the argument."
"Yeah. So I'd say urgency, I'd given it a seven. I mean it does seeing numbers needed to treat, pushes me to a seven on that one and Breztri motivate to prescribe Breztri, I'd say a six And differentiates a six stronger arguments across the board."
" inaudible 00:55:26  I don't know. I don't think it really, no... I think it hasn't.   00:55:32  I think we called it seven to motivate Breztri. I mean, it's a... I think you've the... I thought it was a stronger argument, but maybe not."
"Again, because without seeing numbers needed to treat, it's very hard to know what... When you're treating an individual patient rather than a population, it's hard to say to that patient, ""Why should I take this stuff?"" They ask that. ""It's more expensive. It has more side effects."" And if I could say, ""Well I can promise you a decreased risk of hospitalizations."" I've never said anyone decreased risk of mortality, but in the back of my mind, I can think that and decreased risk of exacerbation I mean, it is more motivating to use the bread stream."
"Probably. Yeah. I mean, I think that would just... The Original was, I guess was fine in that respect. It just was lacking clinical context, which is what number needed to treat really adds to the argument."
"Going from 0.15 hospitalizations to 0.13 doesn't mean a whole lot. Or when you say that means, one out of 80 or one, have you that's a much more apprehensive argument."
"No, the charts are fine as the single numbers are right there. Yeah. I mean, you got the single number, so you can either just stick to the... Yeah. I think the original."
"No, I prefer, okay.... Original E I like the bar chart, but if you'd move the three little people on the bottom up there that, would be the best. So that would be the bar chart with the three choices that, and the dropping at 50, the arrow going down to 52%. I like that the best in H I like the bar chart, but I also like the one COPD hospitalization, with 31 patients and M, I, yeah. I'm happy with the Kaplan mayor graph, but again, by putting in the one out, I can't even read it now one out."
Exactly. Just move those move. Those numbers need to treat to the original. Exactly. Yeah.
So I'm a board certified in internal medicine and I practice as a hospitalist. You're hearing me right? Okay.
"Always about the Zoom calls, you can't tell what is what. Anyway. So, board certified internist, I practice as a hospitalist. I've been practicing for over past six years, post-residency. My role in day to day is basically, admit patients, take care of them during hospital stay and appropriate distress plans accordingly, post-treatment. So we see variety of patients including, again, patients with heart failure or other cardiac diseases, plus their other diseases."
"We sometimes diagnose initially, first time heart failure in a hospital setting, both with preserved ejection fraction, reduced ejection fraction, bring in cardiology as needed and work them up and put them on medications and have them discharged to community under the cardiology follow-up, basically."
"Right now we're seeing more and more with the preserved ejection fraction, I guess, because of other comorbidities. I mean, it's hard to tell exactly percentage wise. Roughly maybe last year... I definitely see again, if I just do plain 100%, maybe 40/60, 40 of preserved EF and, I mean, 60 of preserved, 40 of reduced EF."
"I think it's just because it's so underrated. When you say people have heart failure, you always automatically think about reduced EF and those are already severe in sicker patients and that's given. But preserved is because we're thinking more and more hypertension that goes undiagnosed. People are getting short of breath and they have no idea what's going on and turns out it's preserved. You can look at the echo but then they've uncontrolled hypertension, maybe kidney disease and all the things that precipitating these things."
"We do. I mean, we'll put them mostly on a reduced EF."
"Yeah, that will be a little relative based on the centers and cardiologists and who reads what, because most of the ejection fraction like we know, it's the estimation of what cardiology think it is. So we'll think 45. Anyway, 45 is on the slightly reduced ejection fraction. So if we put around 50 and above, so anywhere from 55 and above we would just consider preserved EF."
"So preserved EF patient always comes in with vague symptoms. They might have aclopmia, they might have some swelling or most patients might not have swelling. But they will just come in with, let's say, I can't breathe, shortness of breath. And shortness of breath is always vague, that means you can have lung disease involvement. Again, obviously heart disease or any other things. But if we look at the reduced EF, they are definitely swollen and they definitely have maybe pulmonary edema signs and most of the time most of them definitely have ischemic heart disease. So in that sense, I would say they're sicker."
"Again, I will probably just have to think about an example, reduced EF, once we, let's say identify if this is ischemic heart disease related coronary artery disease related. Managing those, like either needing a stent versus bypass or whatever, if you can do that underlying almost even seemed like a simple. If we can fix that, maybe the heart will recover and again, goal-directed medications can help preserve the EF or even increase it as we go along as we treat. Even though they're sicker, harder to treat or in the beginning phase, almost maybe it's easily manageable."
"But it's those people who have preserved EF it's hard to... It again goes back to what their understanding of heart failure is. Because when you talk about it, it says heart failure, failure that means your heart has failed, maybe it's not pumping. But then it becomes harder for us to explain to them that your heart is doing fine, really fine. But sometimes what we'll describe is your heart is okay to pump like squeeze, but not relax. So that's how we sometimes explain. So just because it's harder to explain and harder to describe the disease course, it becomes a little to them. So that's why sometimes we see people with preserve EF come to us maybe a lot more than reduced EF."
"First goes again, it depends on where you are in the country and what kind of community you have for them. So some people have good access to healthcare, so they can always call their doctor like cardiologist within. We always tell them, within the first week of discharge, you need to see someone so that you don't end up back in hospital. So almost always, these all are reduced EF patients. So that's why they have a better niche, I guess because everybody knows what it is. EF is reduced, this is what you need to do. All those ones with preserved EF it's just like, yeah my heart is okay. But sometimes, somehow I just can't breathe or some things. So it just doesn't get categorized, I feel like, properly."
"I think it's mostly, again, it goes both ways. Sometimes some people probably don't think that way. We are in the hospital medicine side, so that means we only see all the sickest patients. So maybe I can't speak for the primary care physicians, how they view things. But teaching wise, we're taught the same way. So first step starts with the patient, maybe patient, most patients not understanding. Like how is my high blood pressure maybe causing me to have some dysfunction in the heart, but my pump is okay. You know, right?"
"I think so. I mean, we treat everyone when they come to with fluid overload. If there is other ideology we'll treat the same way."
Right. The patients side might not feel like it's a big deal.
"But it is a big deal at the end of it because we see the sequel, we see the readmissions. I guess for us, we treat the same way. It doesn't really matter to us if it's preserved or reduced."
"Probably not. If I tell you that your disease, it's not a slam dunk in a way, but it is maybe that, maybe you're not going to take that seriously compared to your heart is not working. Everybody on a normal people, lay person thinks that what are my chances? What are the stage of some things? It's like they all associate it like cancer. If you have stage four cancer, you obviously take it serious. But if you have a nodule, it might be cancer, that might not be a big deal."
"But if you have stage four cancer and you're dying, that's a big deal. But to us, to providers, we're talking about a disease process that's going to eventually kill you. So that's why a reduced EF, your heart is not working that well as a suboptimal level might hit somebody big and saying, yeah your heart it's maybe functioning suboptimally or has a different process, or your pump is fine. It's pumping okay. That means, Hey I'm okay."
I think it's just how they register on when we explain things.
"I would feel it's the different manifestation of the same thing. At the end of the day, there's one target organ, which is not functioning at a hundred percent. So numbers are objective, so that's how it helps us classify. That's how it helps us make guidelines and get treatment plans and things like that. But to us, if you are short of breath, you're short of breath. You could care less if your EF is 35 versus 65. You're short of breath, you're short of breath. If you're so on, you are so on. So to us, I think a disease is a disease, to us it's a heart failure disease. I would treat it the best, the way I can from whatever I have access to and whatever I can do. So I feel like it's just the same disease with a different manifestation."
"I think so. It just, I can go back to simple analogy. It's a pump and a pump where after being overloaded, it can fail too."
"I wouldn't say often because maybe a limitation sometimes for us is because we don't have, let's say outpatient practice to see that same patient over the course of entirety of their frequent visits to everything else. So, yeah. It'd be slightly harder for us to tell if the same person has gone from like, preserved EF to reduced EF to like worsening."
"So obviously, a female patient about, I said 75 plus years old came into us with concerns of some shortness of breath, chest pain type issues. So this one, we knew that from outpatient cardiology had sent to us. So we know that she carried the diagnosis of heart failure. Again, from chart review, the data is estimation so it's like within the last two years. Of course, she was diagnosed as an outpatient and being managed by the cardiologist. But the reason we're seeing her was for some shortness of breath, chest pain issues. So she required additional workup in the hospital setting. So she underwent through again, cardiac catheterization and everything else."
"In her case I think, two most important factor on this one is  inaudible 00:16:30  atrial fibrillation, which can both make someone... Again, so if you look at it, the EF is about 50%. So earlier I mentioned so somewhere around like 45 to 55, we would consider normal. So in this one again, she did not have typical fashion of fluid overloaded, crackle in the lungs, she didn't have any of that but she was short of breath. But again, this one makes a little complicated because if you are an AFib RVR, you can accumulate some fluids, you can be short of breath.  inaudible 00:17:06  that can also trying to accumulate little bit of fluid, backflow fluid, and can make her short of breath."
"But again, all the workup was done. She got some Lasix, IV Lasix. She was already at home as well too. But then she did well in ++++the last few days and she was discharged back to her community."
"I guess he was managing outpatient, but sometimes when patient are already short of breath, despite their home dose of Lasix. So sometimes we feel that they do need that IV form to diuresis a little aggressively. And in her case, the complication could have been  inaudible 00:18:05  AFib. So, if she had gone like RVR, few days that she did not notice or know, she could have already flow and overloaded slightly more compared to her normal dosing of Lasix at home."
"So cardiology, primary care, but most patients show up on their own because they just can't breathe. And that's their easiest way to find this emergency room, unfortunately. So it's a biggest problem anywhere I'm sure in the country, because these patients, we just cannot keep them out for 30 days."
"Somehow they just manage to find the hospital sooner, that primary care or the cardiologist."
And that's a separate issue about system issue and all that stuff.
All across. I would say all across. All heart failures actually has higher risk of readmission if they do not see their provider within at least for seven to 10 days.
"I would say most common is they're already diagnosed, most of them."
"And they're small percenters, but we will have a first diagnosis and then work them up."
So I would say most of the preserved ones probably don't have the cardiologist. Maybe they're just getting managed by the primary care physician. And somehow they just get worse and they sent for like further work up. Because primary care only can do so much in the office. So I guess that's how they get sent most of the time.
"So we would. If, let's say, a patient comes in, just has a history of hypertension..."
"There are lags when they're sent for, let's say echos, maybe come back reevaluate. I mean, it's easier if the physical manifestation is there, if you are obviously swollen and whatnot, everybody knows that you have maybe like heart failure. But if you're not, if you're very subtle, maybe you're obese, you can't tell if you're really swelling or gaining weight, but you have like shortness of breath, slowly getting your thought and things like that. Because of essence of time, I guess, they get sent to us maybe in the ER, and then they get admitted for us, like heart failure where we diagnose them."
Because they're already been working with them.
"A combination of both. A combination of both. People who are following the regimen and have cardiologist, sometimes things change, whatever. Thanksgiving happened and then they end up with us, which happens. I mean, surprisingly every year, this is what happened after Thanksgiving we see a lot of heart failures. And these both, I mean, a combination of both reduced and preserved because they did not adhere to what they were supposed to. I mean, sometimes the access, maybe the cardiologists were not free enough or they called, they didn't get to them, their symptoms were getting worse and then that's how they end up with us."
"Maximum four. Yeah. Maximum four. Most of the times we'll try to be aggressive with diuresis. When we know for sure, Lasix, again no. So we know that she definitely has heart failure, so we don't have to wait for our workup. We don't necessarily need an echo, repeat echo. So we just start on diuresis and see, track and trend and maybe try to get her out as soon as we can."
"So right away, let's say, ER physician see her, she presents with symptoms of shortness of breath, some swelling, you start with some Lasix therapy. So ideally again, I can't speak for ER physicians, but ideally we would want to know how much they take and maybe just convert to IV of the same dose. If I do see them and I do see them, they're really off their weight, let's say five pounds plus, we will start very aggressive dose of diuretics. That means anywhere from... Given the creatinine numbers are normal, we would go anywhere from, let's say Lasix of 40 three times a dat to even Lasix strip. So we'll try to be as aggressive as we can."
"So I definitely see the plateauing. So at least some people will have a dry weight on them, they already know because they've been through this before. So we'll try to get to the dry weight. We'll work with, again, we work with cardiology so we have different version of what cardiology wants. Some people like to do initial proBNP or BNP in the beginning, and maybe try to diuresis them until their dry weight. Maybe get a proBNP and discharge. So we know that at dry weight, whatever the BNP is, that's their baseline, given that there are other factors that's changing again, sometimes obesity, disease, things like that. So we look at... But basically most of us it's clinical. So if we feel like, again, no crackles in the lungs, the pitting edema has gone down. Let's say if it was two plus, three plus in the hospital admission and now you are trace edema, good enough. You can now go back to that, let's say normal home doses and then be discharged."
"So we do. Yeah. As a cardiologist, sometimes will be on board. Most of the hospitals now have, again, heart failure is a problem, so there's accounts for lots of readmissions, sometimes increased length of stay. So basically most hospitals as to why sometimes they want automatic cardiology consult. So cardiology will work with us but we will admit and discharge. We're in charge of that."
"So again, like I said earlier to us fluid overload is a fluid overload. And then the workup starts. If you come in say you have this hypertension and diabetes and now you are fluid overloaded, or you at least seem overloaded with shortness of breath. So, if one of the differential..."
"So at that time, I know there's no clear diagnosis. Let's say two major with fluid overload or shortness of breath would be, one is heart failure, two is kidney disease, then at least from the first initial lab work we can tell from creatinine if your kidney numbers are elevated."
"Yeah. Yeah. So basically what I was saying is, so to me, when I look at a patient have symptoms of shortness of breath and or edema elsewhere or generalize on the  inaudible 00:29:09  and once we formulate a plan for differential being heart failure and we have to add kidney disease, which can also do the similar things. We will treat the patient almost in the same way. So we'll try to take the fluid off of you. Depends on how severe the condition is, sometimes we can do a static or not, but that is a tool that we definitely need to diagnose now, if you have a heart failure. If again, the ejection fraction comes normal and your kidney functions are normal, that means we do have to look at the other parameters. That means you have a preserved EF, but you still might have a heart failure. So that might warrant more workup. Maybe even just do ischemic workup depending on how you present it. But I will treat the same way. I will try to get the fluid off you."
"And then I will see what I can do to manage the disease now, that disease, whatever that might come up to."
"So mostly starting with a simple workup would be just again, standard lab works. Just make sure that your kidney functions are okay, that's one. We can add BNP, but again, it's a clinical diagnosis, but we'll as objective or a baseline if you want to consider, we can add BNP's."
"Me personally, I don't really care for it. If I see clinically a patient is in heart failure, fluid overloaded you're in heart failure. If the BNP comes normal, then that's the dilemma to some, what do you do, not treat? It's not acceptable. You have to treat them. So it doesn't really matter. So to me, it doesn't matter. It's a clinical di... Heart failure is a clinical diagnosis. That's not objective number diagnosis, it's a clinical diagnosis. But we will add it just for a baseline sake for a patient, because we are a community hospital, that means we see the same people again and again, most the time. So we can keep track and trend and then the next would be echo."
"I didn't hear. Yeah, I didn't hear any of that."
"So the kidney functions are normal, other parameters would be looking at the history of hypertension. So if I know that they have uncontrolled hypertension, that means more likely favor me for preserved EF heart failure preserved EF."
"So, basically the main thing in that code report is I'm looking at is EF is preserved, so that's the normal EF range that we describe about. Sometimes compliance of the ventricles basically. So, if decreased compliance can also tell me that. I mean, sometimes they'll describe grade two diastolic, grade one, grade two diastolic dysfunction. So that also helps me."
"So basically, like I said, so we continue with the Lasix regimen or offload fluid, and let's say secondary reason, like blood pressure management and things like that, we'll control that. And so with the preserve EF maybe we will not do any of their ischemic workup or anything like that. We'll just continue to manage the blood pressure, diuresis them, make them to dry weight. And then they go out on a community. Again, either on just primary care or cardiology care."
"So since we sometimes are also internists and we are sending on the care of internists, I feel like we can manage on our own unless the patient has any cause of secondary hypertension or the blood pressure has not been well managed on our patient, then we'll try to get them to a specialist so that it can be looked in both ways, both the heart related and blood pressure related condition."
"Unless, yeah. Sounds complicated. Let's say recurrent admission and then we'll try to go send it to a specialist."
"Same again, sometimes it's a hospital related thing that every 100% of the patient who is admitted will be seen by the cardiologist and they'll be seen by the cardiologist. Ours also case by case. So like I said, to me, heart failure is heart failure. It depends on how easy just to manage the heart failure. Sometimes that depends. If it's easy that I can just start on some diuretics and control their whatever respect that I can control. I would just probably manage on my own and then discharge them."
"Right. So most of the time with preserve EF if the disease condition is not that worse or even newer diagnosis. We might even be able to continue, let's say diuretics therapy going home. Maybe control, let's say if, I think maybe because hypertension is doing this, you have uncontrolled hypertension and that's what's doing this. Then maybe we'll just focus on controlling your blood pressure and send you. We'll give you maybe PRN Lasix with guidance that if your weight is increasing, let's say three pounds an up, then you can take PRN and Lasix at home."
"No, because we diuresed for a couple of days with high doses of Lasix and then went back to the same medication."
"This one is a pretty complex case as complex can get, there is some degree, again, his EF might be even higher than that. The complexity on his cases, his blood pressure is super uncontrolled and he's allergic to every single medication. So, that possessed a challenge. And this one is also a cardiology patient and cardiology works with him very closely. Even then he is admitted to the hospital every week for shortness of breath."
"So we can tell that again, he, I think he is intolerant to ACE or ARB, so that's why he's on that combination in  inaudible 00:39:44 . So he's someone that has uncontrolled blood pressure, which decrease the compliance for his heart. So even though his ejection fraction is preserved, he always have the symptoms of shortness of breath. So every, when I say every week, maybe not every week, but he comes very often that he just really needs a very high dose of Lasix in the hospital, feels better and goes home."
"Yeah. And his complexity also, you look at it, he has CKD. So that always a factor because we can't do high dose of Lasix because also, he has a kidney problem, which might be also additionally contributing."
"So in his, if I remember correctly, I think we just increased the dose of Lasix that he normally takes at home. Because I guess because also CKD, we have to account for the dose of the Lasix because he is naturally, he's going to require more Lasix compared to other patient, let's say JJ would require lower dose of Lasix."
Depends on where you are. I think SD is probably our more typical patient than the other.
"Right. Because patient let's say patient like JJ will only come because something is not working out so cardiology already there, everything's set up for that patient. But sometimes they come in because something's not working out. So that's what we have to do in case of JJ, we have to do some kind of ischemic workup to see if something new was happening. But in terms of SD, even it's a straightforward case. We know what it is. It just becomes challenging because of comorbidity, sometimes noncompliance and his blood pressure is always up to 200 systolic and we know that that's also creating the problem."
"It's a great medication, but the only problem... So basically, our problem comes in prescribing medication is their side effects. So that's our problem. Coreg, happy to prescribe anytime, any day, because the only thing will make you is, well, let's say either hypertensive or dizzy or bradycardic, people can tell on their own. So again, sometimes it becomes like no brainer. You can give beta blocker, people feel dizzy, or they can check your blood pressure at home and you'll know exactly what's happening. The only problem with let's say Losartan, Lisinopril or any ACE or ARB or talking about Entresto, the combination is monitoring."
"So sometimes depending on what centers you work, what your community is like, I alluded to earlier, if you do not have proper follow up then the next time I see them is with renal failure. And let's say, which was not a problem before, but it's a problem now, plus again, you have your heart failure issue. Maybe you become better at heart failure, I'm not sure. But sometimes that's the problem, but yes. I mean, whoever we have close follow up with the cardiologist, sometimes we will initiate and trust on discharge or I mean, do in the hospital and then discharge them later."
"I mean, worst thing again, I have seen some rep coming in, I think will do for both, but most of them have been used for reduced. But it really depends on... This comes up a lot. So who do you start with or how comfortable I am starting? It depends on what training you had. So when I trained, we barely used it. It Was very new, I must say seven, eight years it's been six plus years. So yes, it was available, but barely used it. So that's what it is. Now, me prescribing is obviously less, very less compared to just ACE and ARB and a beta blocker, otherwise ARB and blocker."
"Yes. I mean, it's all goal reactive therapy, whatever benefits the patient and whatever causes them for less of a readmission it's about that. It's not about my comfort level. Like again, I'm not comfortable doesn't mean I don't prescribe anything. At the end of the day, what does that evidence show and how can we keep the patient off hospital? And also how can we get them home sooner? It's about that. So like I said, I mean, we've been hearing about Entresto a lot, at least in our hospital setting. So we work with cardiologists closely and those patients who has funding, is important because if a patient can't by the medication, there's no point I can write whatever I want, but there's no point. So, two most important things, patient can afford it and patient has the right to follow up."
Most majority of time will be with a cardiologist.
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if I can say this versus that really.
"All our patient has same diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes, and eventually like some kind of heart problem. So are they beneficial? Yes, but I don't know if I can talk very much about it though."
"For diabetes, yes. So I can't just think that someone is just indication for heart failure, no, but diabetes, yes. But I cannot relate saying, okay, since we started you on this maybe your symptoms are better or let's say you're requiring less admissions, remissions. That I don't know if I can speak for."
"So most of our majority of... Again, we do some fluid restrictions when they come in the hospital and they're in fluid heart failure overloaded, but not necessarily that. I mean, again, I think I believe more on low sodium diet compared to fluid restriction. And so that what we'll discuss mostly is just avoiding salt."
"So the guidance is like two gram or less salt, but then for normal people, I don't know if you cook or not. I don't cook, but I can't tell what two gram of salt is for a day. I don't think anyone can tell. So yes, in the hospital setting, maybe we measure it. Maybe they're better at it, but no one knows what two grams of salt is. So basically I tell them, never add extra salt to anything. Again, processed food, chips and whatever this thing , everything has salt in it. But at least you can tell how much salt, maybe if that's truthful, we can tell. But at least when I tell them that they should be no salt, which is not possible to most people, you don't add salt at all, extra, like you have a salt and pepper shaker, don't use it, that's the thing."
"Unfortunately, we're not equipped with a lot because we don't have direct appointment making capacity."
So it's just that we have to take their word for it.
"Yeah. We will reinforce. And you have to see your doctor within one to two weeks and the nurses will, and then the discharge planner will. So unfortunately that's the maximum we can do for our patients."
"I know some centers might book their appointment directly to have them followed. Actually, what we've done recently is some people who have, we have a different branch of, let's say nursing home, home visit company, we place a consult to them. So sometimes they will reach out to the patient."
"So mostly one, when we see readmissions and elderly, we know that maybe they can't just go to the office when they want, or there's some kind of limitation, debility or disability, then we'll try to use those orders."
"So somehow magically patient get better in the hospital, let's say in two or three days, four days, so again, I don't have a magic pill. I'd give the same exact thing that everybody would give. Sometimes I have just better equipment. Let's say I can give IV Lasix, I can put on Lasix strip. I can maybe even dialyze, do certain thing extra a little bit faster. But if on the same scale, so that means access to care. If that would improve, we would manage heart failure very well. I think it just goes back to access of care."
"So resources, so if the medication they can afford and they take, again, there's so many if's. Patient also, it's a partnership between us and the patient. It's not a one way street, so I can tell them, take this, take that, do this, go wherever. But if the patient is not recipient of what I'm saying, it's a problem. It's still a problem. If I tell them to take beta blocker and this and that, but if you didn't take, because it didn't do anything to you, you will never do anything to you. So access to care and of course, I mean, compliance is always there, but I would feel like biggest thing is access to care."
"Absolutely. Again, that should start. If I start diagnosing a patient in the hospital, I should start there. What heart failure means, like I said, it's maybe easy when the situation is grim and bad, people understand faster. When the situation is, let's say again, preserved EF, that means maybe we have to come up with a way to explain the patient that this is also bad. One easy example would be, I'll take the liver, if you are alcoholic and you have a liver failure, like liver cirrhosis, people tend to easily understand that. And now that sometimes liver will just shut down and you die unless they come for other reasons, whatever reason. But if you say you have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or just fatty liver disease, maybe people think it is benign. It's just livers fat or... But it can have the same exact consequences."
"So I guess it's just ties up with our heart failure too. If you know the heart is not working or functioning at 5% EF, that means you have end state heart failure. You're done, that's it. Your pump is not working. It's too grim, but people might understand that very fast rather than saying your heart is doing fine, but it's just that you get short of breath sometimes or you get symptoms sometimes because you didn't control your blood pressure because of this, that, then people will be like, I'm okay. Sometimes, some things happens to me. But the consequence might be still the same at the end of the day, you have severe debilitating heart failure."
"Probably. It depends on the teaching, who taught you where and how? I can't speak for the generation before me, I can only speak for the generation like what I am trained. So I look at heart failure as heart failure. Like really, I don't care if it's reduced or not reduced because patients are debilitating the same way. So maybe it's my belief cause exactly what happens. Physician don't believe it is, it's not it. And that's what you'll tell the patient."
"There is no guideline for me to speak on some things. If patient has heart failure, this is how you say some things. There's nothing like that. No one can tell me to tell a patient. If I don't believe preserve heart failure is a heart failure, then it's not it. Then whoever I've seen, I will tell the same thing. You're fine, you're okay. This is a condition that might happen to you sometimes, but it's okay. So patient will take the same thing home. That's their take home message. If sometimes something happens to me, but I'm okay, there's nothing to be done or nothing needs to be done. So maybe."
At least I'm lucky enough that I don't think I have any circle of people that I know have the same feeling. Our cardiologist are very aggressive and... The way I would anyways. And so that's why it works. And I was trained in New York and I think that training has brought me here that I practice the same way that I was trained.
"Oh, no, thank you. I mean, it was very informal, I guess we talked a lot about... So what's the objective. I mean, if I don't know, if I may ask because sometimes..."
"Okay. All right. Well, happy to be part of the future, need to be."
"So yeah, this is definitely as simple as it sounds, yes, it is very painful because it costs a lot of money when people are readmitted. Sometimes hospitals don't get reimbursed for the same diagnosis that we've been treating for let's say about some months. And like I said, it's probably very simple to treat if only everybody were in the same page."
