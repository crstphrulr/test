I was lying in bed a little while later when my chest was filled with a growing pain as I laid there, and it kept tightening and became harder to breathe with each breath. I kept tossing and turning, holding my chest and I started feeling numbness in my body, in my skin as it became cold. After so long I climbed out of my bunk and as I climbed down, I fell, and I was found by family who took me to hospital. I kept slipping in and out of consciousness as my brain was not getting enough oxygen at times, but I made it just in time. I might have died, I may not have, but I just remember gradually feeling like I was fading as I was not feeling the pain any more. I did not feel afraid, and that was the strangest part. I wondered if that was how death would feel one day, and afterwards I felt calmer about my fears."

My doctor ordered me not to do anything strenuous for a while, at least until my platelet count was back high enough to clot my blood. Within a few months I was healthy again.
