Within a few minutes my nose became black and blue, to the point where it was embarrassing. All of my friends were pointing at my face and laughing. The kid who did it didn't really mean to cause he any harm, and in fact, he actually may have saved my life that day. The next day my mom took me to the doctor to find out why my nose bruised so easily. It turned out that I had a very rare condition called ITP which caused the body to produce low amounts of blood platelets. My doctor ordered me not to do anything strenuous for a while, at least until my platelet count was back high enough to clot my blood. Within a few months I was healthy again. So, even though I was upset at the time and embarrassed, the kid who pinched my nose only helped me that day.","Anger (e.g., Rage, Mad, or Irritated)",,,"Anxiety (e.g., Dread, Nervous, or Worry)","Sadness (e.g., Grief, Lonely, or Empty)",,,
